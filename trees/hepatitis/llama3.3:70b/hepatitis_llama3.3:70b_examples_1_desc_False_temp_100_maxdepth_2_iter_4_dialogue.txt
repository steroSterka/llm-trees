To induce a decision tree classifier for patient survival based on the provided features, with a maximum depth of 2, we first need to identify the most important features. Since the dataset and specific details about the target variable (survival or death) are not provided, I'll guide you through a general approach using Python's scikit-learn library, which is commonly used for machine learning tasks.

Given the features:
- age (years)
- sex (male / female)
- steroids (yes / no)
- antivirals (yes / no)
- fatigue (yes / no)
- malaise (yes / no)
- anorexia (yes / no)
- liver big (yes / no)
- liver firm (yes / no)
- spleen palpable (yes / no)
- spider angiomata (yes / no)
- ascites (yes / no)
- varices (yes / no)
- bilirubin (mg/dL)
- alkaline phosphatase (units/liter)
- serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase level (units/liter)
- albumin level (g/dL)
- prothrombin time (seconds)
- histologic data (yes / no)

We aim to classify patients as either surviving or dying based on these features.

### Step 1: Prepare the Data
First, you need a dataset where each row represents a patient, and columns represent the features listed above, plus an additional column for the target variable (survival status).

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Assuming 'df' is your DataFrame and 'survived' is your target variable
X = df.drop('survived', axis=1)  # Features
y = df['survived']  # Target variable

# Split dataset into training set and test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=1)
```

### Step 2: Convert Categorical Variables
Since many of your features are categorical (e.g., sex, steroids), you'll need to convert them into a format that the DecisionTreeClassifier can handle.

```python
# Example for converting one categorical feature
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

le = LabelEncoder()
X_train['sex'] = le.fit_transform(X_train['sex'])
X_test['sex'] = le.transform(X_test['sex'])

# Repeat this process for all categorical features
```

### Step 3: Train the Decision Tree Classifier
Now, train a DecisionTreeClassifier on your data with a maximum depth of 2.

```python
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2, random_state=1)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

### Step 4: Feature Importance
To see which features are most important for the classifier's decisions, you can use the `feature_importances_` attribute of the DecisionTreeClassifier.

```python
importances = clf.feature_importances_
print("Feature Importances:", importances)
```

This will give you an array where each value represents the importance of the feature at that index. The indices correspond to the order of your features in `X_train`.

### Step 5: Visualizing the Decision Tree
To visualize the decision tree and see how it splits based on features, you can use `plot_tree` from scikit-learn.

```python
from sklearn.tree import plot_tree
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))
plot_tree(clf, feature_names=X_train.columns, class_names=['Did not survive', 'Survived'], filled=True)
plt.show()
```

This visualization will show you the decision-making process of your tree, including which features it splits on at each node and the criteria for those splits.

Remember, the actual performance and feature importance can vary based on your specific dataset. Always validate your model's performance using techniques like cross-validation to ensure its generalizability.

Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. For simplicity, let's assume we're using thresholds that are somewhat meaningful based on general medical knowledge.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Decision Tree to Predict Patient Survival

    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing patient features.
        - AGE: age (years)
        - SEX: sex (2 = male, 1 = female)
        - STEROID: steriods (0 = no, 1 = yes)
        - ANTIVIRALS: antivirals (0 = no, 1 = yes)
        - FATIGUE: fatigue (0 = no, 1 = yes)
        - MALAISE: malaise (0 = no, 1 = yes)
        - ANOREXIA: anorexia (0 = no, 1 = yes)
        - LIVER BIG: liver big (0 = no, 1 = yes)
        - LIVER FIRM: liver firm (0 = no, 1 = yes)
        - SPLEEN PALPABLE: spleen palpable (0 = no, 1 = yes)
        - SPIDERS: spider angiomata (0 = no, 1 = yes)
        - ASCITES: ascites (0 = no, 1 = yes)
        - VARICES: varices (0 = no, 1 = yes)
        - BILIRUBIN: bilirubin (mg/dL)
        - ALK PHOSPHATE: alkaline phosphatase (units/liter)
        - SGOT: serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase level (units/liter)
        - ALBUMIN: albumin level (g/dL)
        - PROTIME: prothrombin time (seconds)
        - HISTOLOGY: histologic data (0 = no, 1 = yes)

    Returns:
    prediction (int): Predicted survival status (0 = die, 1 = live).
    nodes (list): List of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """

    # Initialize nodes list
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Node 1: Check if bilirubin level is within a relatively safe range (< 5 mg/dL)
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 5

    # Node 2: If the first condition is met, check if albumin level is above a certain threshold (> 3 g/dL)
    nodes[1] = X["ALBUMIN"] > 3 if nodes[0] else False

    # Prediction logic based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # If both conditions are met, patient is likely to survive
        else:
            prediction = 0  # If albumin level is low despite normal bilirubin, survival chances decrease
    else:
        prediction = 0  # High bilirubin level indicates poor liver function, decreasing survival chances

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This decision tree uses two conditions to predict patient survival: the bilirubin level and the albumin level. If both levels are within safe ranges, the patient is predicted to survive. Otherwise, the patient's survival chances decrease.

Please note that this is a simplified example and actual medical diagnoses should be made by qualified healthcare professionals using comprehensive evaluations and more sophisticated models.
