To build a decision tree classifier based on the provided features for predicting whether a patient survives or dies, we'll follow a step-by-step approach. Note that the actual construction of an optimal decision tree would typically involve algorithms like ID3, C4.5, or CART, and would be aided by computational tools due to the complexity and number of features involved. However, I can guide you through a conceptual process based on the information given.

### Step 1: Data Preparation
- **Categorize Features**: We have both numerical (age, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase level, albumin level, prothrombin time) and categorical (sex, steroids, antivirals, fatigue, malaise, anorexia, liver big, liver firm, spleen palpable, spider angiomata, ascites, varices, histologic data) features.
- **Target Variable**: The target variable is survival status (survives or dies), which we aim to predict.

### Step 2: Feature Selection
Given the large number of features, not all may be equally important for predicting patient outcomes. Features like bilirubin, albumin level, and prothrombin time are directly related to liver function, which can be critical in determining survival outcomes, especially considering the context of liver disease suggested by other features (liver big, liver firm, ascites, varices).

### Step 3: Decision Tree Construction
For simplicity, let's consider constructing a decision tree based on some of the most informative features related to liver health and overall patient condition.

1. **Root Node**: Start with a feature that has a significant impact on survival, such as bilirubin levels. Elevated bilirubin is associated with worse outcomes.
   - **Bilirubin (mg/dL) <= 2.0**: This could be an initial split, considering normal or mildly elevated levels might have different implications than significantly elevated levels.

2. **First Branch**:
   - For patients with bilirubin <= 2.0, consider the next most informative feature. Albumin level is crucial as it reflects the liver's synthetic function and nutritional status.
     - **Albumin Level (g/dL) >= 3.5**: This could indicate a better prognosis within this subgroup.

3. **Second Branch**:
   - For patients with bilirubin > 2.0, indicating potentially more severe liver dysfunction, consider prothrombin time as it reflects the liver's ability to produce coagulation factors.
     - **Prothrombin Time (seconds) <= 15**: This might suggest a relatively preserved liver function despite elevated bilirubin.

### Example Decision Tree:
```
|--- Bilirubin (mg/dL) <= 2.0
||--- Albumin Level (g/dL) >= 3.5
|||--- Class: Survives
||--- Albumin Level (g/dL) < 3.5
|||--- Class: Dies
|--- Bilirubin (mg/dL) > 2.0
||--- Prothrombin Time (seconds) <= 15
|||--- Class: Survives
||--- Prothrombin Time (seconds) > 15
|||--- Class: Dies
```

### Note:
- This is a highly simplified example and actual decision tree construction would require statistical analysis and possibly machine learning algorithms to determine the most significant features and their optimal split points.
- The choice of features and split points in this example is based on general medical knowledge and might not reflect the best approach without access to the specific dataset and its analysis.

This code defines a function `predict` that takes a dictionary of patient features as input and returns a tuple containing the prediction (die = 0, live = 1) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The decision tree is based on the bilirubin level, albumin level, and prothrombin time.

Note: You may need to adjust the threshold values in the decision tree based on your specific dataset and requirements.
