To build a decision tree for classifying whether a patient survives or dies based on the provided features, we first need to understand that the dataset you're referring to is likely related to liver disease. However, without actual data or clear outcomes (survived/died), I'll create a hypothetical decision tree focusing on features that are commonly associated with severe liver conditions and patient survival. This example will be based on my interpretation of which features might be most impactful.

Given the complexity and the categorical nature of some variables, a real-world approach would involve converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding for multiple categories or binary for yes/no) and considering continuous variables as they are. For simplicity, I'll directly address how certain critical features could influence survival:

1. **Bilirubin Levels**: High levels of bilirubin can indicate severe liver dysfunction.
2. **Albumin Level**: Low albumin levels often correlate with poorer outcomes in liver disease patients.
3. **Prothrombin Time (PT)**: Prolonged PT suggests coagulopathy, which is a bad prognostic sign.

**Hypothetical Decision Tree**

|--- Albumin level (g/dL) <= 2.5
||--- class: likely to die (indicating severe liver dysfunction and poor nutritional status)
|--- Albumin level (g/dL) > 2.5
||--- Bilirubin (mg/dL) <= 3
|||--- Prothrombin Time (seconds) <= 18
||||--- class: likely to survive (suggesting relatively stable liver function and coagulation status)
|||--- Prothrombin Time (seconds) > 18
||||--- class: uncertain, further evaluation needed (prolonged PT indicates risk but albumin and bilirubin are within better ranges)
||--- Bilirubin (mg/dL) > 3
|||--- class: likely to die (high bilirubin despite relatively normal albumin level suggests severe liver dysfunction)

**Important Note**: This decision tree is a simplification for illustrative purposes. Real clinical scenarios would involve more nuanced assessments, including additional tests and longitudinal data on patient health over time. The classification here does not account for all variables mentioned in your list (like sex, antivirals, etc.) that could also influence survival rates.

**Building a Real Decision Tree**: To accurately build a decision tree based on the provided features and a dataset with survival outcomes, you would typically use machine learning algorithms available in libraries like scikit-learn in Python. This process involves:
1. Preprocessing data (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables).
2. Splitting data into training and testing sets.
3. Using a decision tree classifier or random forest on the training set to find the most important features and create the tree.
4. Evaluating the model's performance on the test set.

Without access to your dataset, creating an accurate decision tree isn't possible here. However, this hypothetical example illustrates how key liver health indicators might influence survival predictions in a simplified scenario.

Here's a Python function that represents the decision tree for predicting patient survival based on the provided features.

```python
def predict_survival(X: dict):
    # Initialize node values as None
    nodes = [None] * 4
    
    # Define thresholds for features
    albumin_threshold = 2.5
    bilirubin_threshold = 3
    protime_threshold = 18

    # Evaluate conditions at each node
    nodes[0] = X['ALBUMIN'] <= albumin_threshold
    if not nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X['BILIRUBIN'] <= bilirubin_threshold
        if nodes[1]:
            nodes[2] = X['PROTIME'] <= protime_threshold
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Survive
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Die (uncertain due to prolonged PT, but albumin and bilirubin are relatively normal)
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Die (high bilirubin indicates severe liver dysfunction)
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Die (low albumin level indicates poor nutritional status and liver function)

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree focuses on the features `ALBUMIN`, `BILIRUBIN`, and `PROTIME` to predict patient survival. If the albumin level is low (`<= 2.5 g/dL`), it immediately predicts death due to poor nutritional status and liver function. Otherwise, it evaluates bilirubin levels; if high (`> 3 mg/dL`), it predicts death due to severe liver dysfunction. Finally, for patients with relatively normal albumin and bilirubin levels, it checks the prothrombin time (PT); a prolonged PT (`> 18 seconds`) indicates uncertainty but leans towards predicting death.

You can call this function by passing in a dictionary `X` containing the feature values as keys:

```python
feature_values = {
    'AGE': 45,
    'SEX': 2, 
    'STEROID': 1,
    'ANTIVIRALS': 0,
    'FATIGUE': 1,
    'MALAISE': 1,
    'ANOREXIA': 1,
    'LIVER BIG': 1,
    'LIVER FIRM': 1,
    'SPLEEN PALPABLE': 1,
    'SPIDERS': 0,
    'ASCITES': 1,
    'VARICES': 0,
    'BILIRUBIN': 2.5, 
    'ALK PHOSPHATE': 100,
    'SGOT': 50,
    'ALBUMIN': 3.8,
    'PROTIME': 15,
    'HISTOLOGY': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict_survival(feature_values)
print("Prediction:", prediction) 
print("Node Values:", nodes)
```
