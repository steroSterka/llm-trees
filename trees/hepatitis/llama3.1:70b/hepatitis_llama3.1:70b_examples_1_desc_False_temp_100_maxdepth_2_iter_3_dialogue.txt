Based on the provided features, I'll build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 to classify whether a patient survives or dies. Please note that this is a simplified example and actual medical diagnosis should not be based solely on a decision tree.

After analyzing the features, I've selected the most important ones for the decision tree:

1. **Bilirubin (mg/dL)**: High bilirubin levels are often associated with liver disease severity.
2. **Prothrombin time (seconds)**: Abnormal prothrombin times can indicate coagulopathy and poor prognosis.

Here's the induced decision tree:
```
|--- Bilirubin (mg/dL) <= 2.5
||--- Prothrombin time (seconds) <= 18
|||--- class: survives
||--- Prothrombin time (seconds) > 18
|||--- class: dies
|--- Bilirubin (mg/dL) > 2.5
||--- class: dies
```
In this decision tree:

* Patients with bilirubin levels ≤ 2.5 mg/dL and prothrombin time ≤ 18 seconds are more likely to survive.
* Patients with bilirubin levels ≤ 2.5 mg/dL but prothrombin time > 18 seconds are more likely to die due to coagulopathy complications.
* Patients with bilirubin levels > 2.5 mg/dL are generally at higher risk and more likely to die due to severe liver disease.

Please note that this decision tree is a simplification and actual medical diagnosis should consider multiple factors, laboratory results, and clinical expertise.

Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 2.5
    nodes[1] = X["PROTIME"] <= 18
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # survives
        else:
            prediction = 0  # dies
    else:
        prediction = 0  # dies

    return prediction, nodes[:2]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the patient's features and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the predicted outcome (0 for death, 1 for survival), and the second element is a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

In this decision tree:

* Patients with bilirubin levels ≤ 2.5 mg/dL are further evaluated based on their prothrombin time.
	+ If prothrombin time is ≤ 18 seconds, the patient is more likely to survive (prediction = 1).
	+ If prothrombin time is > 18 seconds, the patient is more likely to die due to coagulopathy complications (prediction = 0).
* Patients with bilirubin levels > 2.5 mg/dL are predicted to die (prediction = 0).

Note that I removed the third node from the output list since it's not used in this particular decision tree implementation.
