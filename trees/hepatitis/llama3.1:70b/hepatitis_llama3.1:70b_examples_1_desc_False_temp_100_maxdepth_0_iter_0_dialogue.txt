I'll induce a decision tree classifier using the provided features. Please note that I'll use a simplified approach, and the resulting tree might not be optimal.

After analyzing the features, I've identified the most important ones for building the decision tree:

1. **Bilirubin (mg/dL)**: High bilirubin levels are often associated with liver dysfunction, which can lead to mortality.
2. **Prothrombin time (seconds)**: Elevated prothrombin time indicates coagulopathy, which is a common complication in patients with severe liver disease.
3. **Albumin level (g/dL)**: Low albumin levels are often seen in patients with cirrhosis and liver failure.

Using these features, I've built the decision tree:
```
|--- Bilirubin (mg/dL) <= 2.0
||--- Albumin level (g/dL) > 3.5
||||--- class: survives
||--- Albumin level (g/dL) <= 3.5
||||--- Prothrombin time (seconds) <= 15
|||||--- class: survives
||||--- Prothrombin time (seconds) > 15
|||||--- class: dies
|--- Bilirubin (mg/dL) > 2.0
||--- Prothrombin time (seconds) <= 18
||||--- class: survives
||--- Prothrombin time (seconds) > 18
||||--- class: dies
```
This decision tree can be interpreted as follows:

* If bilirubin levels are low (<= 2.0 mg/dL), the patient is more likely to survive if albumin levels are high (> 3.5 g/dL).
* If albumin levels are low (<= 3.5 g/dL) and prothrombin time is short (<= 15 seconds), the patient still has a good chance of survival.
* However, if bilirubin levels are high (> 2.0 mg/dL), the patient's chances of survival decrease significantly.
* In cases with high bilirubin levels, a longer prothrombin time (> 18 seconds) indicates a higher risk of mortality.

Please note that this decision tree is not meant to be used as a clinical tool and should not replace medical expertise. The actual prediction performance may vary depending on the specific dataset and patient population.

Here is the decision tree implemented as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 2.0
    nodes[1] = X["ALBUMIN"] > 3.5
    nodes[2] = X["PROTIME"] <= 18

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features and returns a tuple with two elements: the predicted class label (1 for survives, 0 for dies) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Note that I've used the thresholds 2.0 for bilirubin, 3.5 for albumin, and 18 for prothrombin time based on my previous analysis. These values can be adjusted if needed to optimize the performance of the decision tree.

Also, keep in mind that this is a simplified implementation and may not cover all possible cases or edge conditions. In practice, you would want to use more robust techniques, such as handling missing values, outliers, and using cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning.
