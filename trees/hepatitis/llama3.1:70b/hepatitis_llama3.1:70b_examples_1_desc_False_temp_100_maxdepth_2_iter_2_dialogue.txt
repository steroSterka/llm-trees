Based on the features you provided, I will attempt to build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2. Since the dataset is not explicitly given, I'll make assumptions about the importance of features based on general medical knowledge.

**Decision Tree:**

|--- albumin level (g/dL) <= 3.5
||--- class: dies
|--- albumin level (g/dL) > 3.5
||--- bilirubin (mg/dL) <= 2.0
|||--- class: survives

**Explanation:**

1. The first split is based on the albumin level, which is a crucial indicator of liver function and overall health. Low albumin levels are often associated with poor outcomes in patients.
2. For patients with low albumin levels (<= 3.5 g/dL), the decision tree predicts a higher likelihood of death.
3. For patients with higher albumin levels (> 3.5 g/dL), the second split is based on the bilirubin level, which is another indicator of liver function and jaundice. High bilirubin levels can indicate severe liver damage or disease.

**Feature Importance:**

Based on general medical knowledge, I considered the following features as important:

1. Albumin level (g/dL)
2. Bilirubin (mg/dL)

Other features like age, sex, and various liver-related symptoms were not used in this simplified decision tree, but they may still be relevant for more complex models.

Please note that this is a highly simplified example, and actual decision trees built on real data would require careful consideration of feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. Additionally, this decision tree should not be used as a medical diagnostic tool without proper validation and consultation with medical experts.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier based on the provided features and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 2.0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # die
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # survive
        else:
            prediction = 0  # die

    return prediction, nodes
```

In this function, the decision tree classifier uses two features: "ALBUMIN" and "BILIRUBIN". The first split is based on the albumin level, with a threshold of 3.5 g/dL. If the albumin level is less than or equal to 3.5, the patient is predicted to die (0). Otherwise, the second split is based on the bilirubin level, with a threshold of 2.0 mg/dL. If the bilirubin level is less than or equal to 2.0, the patient is predicted to survive (1). Otherwise, the patient is predicted to die (0).

The function returns both the prediction and the nodes, which represent the decisions made at each split in the decision tree.
