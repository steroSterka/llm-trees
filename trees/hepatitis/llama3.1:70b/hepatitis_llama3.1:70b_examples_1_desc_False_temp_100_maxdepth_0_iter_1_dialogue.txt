Based on the provided features, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict whether a patient survives or dies. Here's the decision tree:

|--- bilirubin (mg/dL) <= 1.5
||--- albumin level (g/dL) > 3.0
|||--- class: survive
||--- albumin level (g/dL) <= 3.0
|||--- prothrombin time (seconds) <= 16.5
||||--- class: survive
||||--- prothrombin time (seconds) > 16.5
|||||--- class: die
|--- bilirubin (mg/dL) > 1.5
||--- alkaline phosphatase (units/liter) <= 150
|||--- liver big (yes / no) = yes
||||--- class: die
|||--- liver big (yes / no) = no
||||--- class: survive
||--- alkaline phosphatase (units/liter) > 150
|||--- class: die

The decision tree uses the following features in order of importance:

1. Bilirubin level: High bilirubin levels are often associated with liver dysfunction and poor outcomes.
2. Albumin level: Low albumin levels can indicate malnutrition, inflammation, or liver disease, all of which can affect survival.
3. Prothrombin time: Prolonged prothrombin times can indicate coagulopathy, which is a risk factor for bleeding and mortality.
4. Alkaline phosphatase level: Elevated alkaline phosphatase levels can indicate liver damage or bone disease.
5. Liver size (liver big): An enlarged liver can be a sign of underlying liver disease.

Note that this decision tree is not based on actual data, but rather an educated guess using the provided features. In practice, it's essential to train and validate a decision tree classifier using real data to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

Here is the Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5
    
    # Node 0: bilirubin (mg/dL) <= 1.5
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 1.5
    
    # Node 1: albumin level (g/dL) > 3.0
    nodes[1] = X["ALBUMIN"] > 3.0
    
    # Node 2: prothrombin time (seconds) <= 16.5
    nodes[2] = X["PROTIME"] <= 16.5
    
    # Node 3: alkaline phosphatase (units/liter) <= 150
    nodes[3] = X["ALK PHOSPHATE"] <= 150
    
    # Node 4: liver big (yes / no)
    nodes[4] = X["LIVER BIG"] == 1

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    
    # Convert boolean values to integers (1 or 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

In this function, we first define the inner nodes based on the decision tree. Then, we use if-else statements to traverse the decision tree and make a prediction based on the input features. The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes as integers (1 or 0).
