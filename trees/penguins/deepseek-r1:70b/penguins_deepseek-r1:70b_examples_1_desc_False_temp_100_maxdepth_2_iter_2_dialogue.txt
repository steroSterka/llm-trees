Alright, so I need to build a decision tree classifier for penguin species using the given features. The maximum depth is 2, which means each path from root to leaf can have at most two splits. The species are Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo.

First, let me list out the features:

1. Island (Biscoe / Dream / Torgersen)
2. Culmen length (mm)
3. Culmen depth (mm)
4. Flipper length (mm)
5. Body mass (g)
6. Sex (male / female)

I'm wondering which of these features are the most important for distinguishing between the species. I know that in machine learning, feature importance can be determined through various methods like Gini importance or information gain. Since I don't have actual data here, I'll have to make educated guesses based on what I know about penguins.

Island might be a good starting point because different penguin species often inhabit different islands. For example, Adelie and Gentoo are found in different regions compared to Chinstrap.

Culmen length and depth are measurements of the bill, which can vary significantly between species. Flipper length is another physical characteristic that might differ. Body mass could also be a distinguishing factor as some species are larger than others. Sex might play a role, but perhaps less so in classification since within each species, both males and females exist.

Given the maximum depth of 2, I can only have two levels of splits. So I need to choose the most informative feature for the root node and then another split based on the next best feature.

Let me think about how each feature could split the data:

- Island: This is a categorical variable with three possible values (Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen). If I use island as the first split, it might separate some species effectively. For example, perhaps Adelie penguins are primarily on Biscoe, Chinstrap on Dream, and Gentoo on Torgersen? Or maybe not exactly that, but something similar.

- Culmen length: This is a numerical feature. I would need to find a threshold where values above or below it can help distinguish species.

I think starting with island makes sense because it's categorical and might naturally split the data into groups that align well with species distribution.

So, first split: Island.

Let me assume:

- Biscoe Island: Maybe this is where Adelie penguins are found.
- Dream Island: Could be Chinstrap.
- Torgersen Island: Perhaps Gentoo.

But I'm not entirely sure if the islands correspond exactly to each species. If that's the case, then at depth 1, we can already classify each island to a species without further splits. However, since the tree needs to have a maximum depth of 2, maybe some islands might have mixed species, or perhaps one island is shared and requires another feature for splitting.

Alternatively, if Island isn't sufficient on its own, I might need to use another feature as the first split. For example, culmen length could be the primary splitter because bill size can vary a lot between species.

But without actual data, it's hard to know which feature is more important. Let me proceed with island as the first split.

So:

Root node: Island

Children:
- Biscoe
- Dream
- Torgersen

If each of these islands corresponds neatly to one species, then each child would directly classify to a species. But if not, I might need further splits.

Alternatively, perhaps some islands are shared by two species, requiring another split based on another feature like culmen length or flipper length.

Given that maximum depth is 2, I can have at most two levels of decisions.

Let me consider an example:

- Island: Biscoe
  - Flipper length <= X cm → Adelie
  - Flipper length > X cm → Gentoo

But wait, if each island only has one species, this might not be necessary. But maybe some islands have multiple species.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is based on culmen length:

- Culmen length <= Y mm → Chinstrap
  - Then, check another feature like flipper length to distinguish between Adelie and Gentoo.
  
But since I can only go two levels deep, after the first split, each branch can have one more split.

I think starting with island is better because it's a categorical variable that might naturally group species. So let me structure it as:

Decision Tree:
- Root: Island
  - Biscoe: Adelie
  - Dream: Chinstrap
  - Torgersen: Gentoo

But if the data doesn't split perfectly by island, I might need to add another feature as a second level.

Alternatively, maybe one of the islands is shared, so for that island, we use another feature like flipper length to decide between two species.

For example:

- Island
  - Biscoe → Adelie
  - Dream → Chinstrap
  - Torgersen
    - Flipper length <= Z mm → Gentoo
    - Flipper length > Z mm → Chinstrap

But I'm not sure if that's accurate. Perhaps Gentoo penguins have longer flippers, so on Torgersen Island, if flipper length is above a certain value, it's Gentoo.

Alternatively, maybe culmen depth is a better second feature.

I think the key here is to select features that are known to distinguish these species. Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo have different bill shapes and sizes. For example:

- Adelie: shorter, more triangular bill
- Chinstrap: thin, black stripe under the chin (but this isn't a feature we have)
- Gentoo: longer, more orange bill

But in terms of culmen length and depth, perhaps Gentoo has a deeper or longer bill.

Given that, maybe after splitting by island, for the islands where species overlap, I can split further based on culmen features.

Alternatively, if I don't use island as the first split, starting with culmen length might be more accurate because it's a numerical feature that can provide clear thresholds.

But without data, this is speculative. For the sake of building the tree as per the example given, I'll proceed to structure it using island as the root and then another feature for the necessary splits where islands don't fully separate species.

Decision Tree:

|--- island: Biscoe  
|    |--- class: Adelie  
|--- island: Dream  
|    |--- class: Chinstrap  
|--- island: Torgersen  
     |--- culmen depth (mm) <= 18.0  
     |    |--- class: Gentoo  
     |--- culmen depth (mm) > 18.0  
          |--- class: Chinstrap

<think>
Okay, I need to format the decision tree provided earlier into a Python function. The goal is for this function to take a dictionary of features and return both the predicted species and a list of truth values representing whether each inner node's condition was met (1 if true, 0 otherwise). 

First, let me recall the structure of the decision tree from before:

- The first split is based on the 'island' feature. If it's Biscoe, the prediction is Adelie (class 0). If it's Dream, then Chinstrap (class 1). For Torgersen island, there's a second condition based on 'culmen_depth_mm'. If culmen depth is <=18.0, predict Gentoo (2), else Chinstrap (1).

So the decision tree has three inner nodes: one for each initial island check, but since Biscoe and Dream are leaf nodes, their conditions don't require further splits. Only Torgersen requires checking 'culmen_depth_mm'.

Wait, in terms of nodes, the first level is island, which is a categorical feature with three possible values (Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen). Since decision trees can handle categorical features directly, we don't need to encode them as dummy variables here. However, in Python, comparing strings can be case-sensitive and exact, so I must ensure that the keys match exactly.

Next, for Torgersen island, the split is based on 'culmen_depth_mm' <= 18.0. So, this is a numerical condition. The nodes list should capture whether each condition was met as we traverse down the tree.

Now, in the function, I'll receive a dictionary X with keys like 'island', 'culmen_length_mm', etc. The target variable is 'species' encoded as 0=Adelie,1=Chinstrap,2=Gentoo.

The function needs to:

1. Check if 'island' is Biscoe → predict Adelie (0)
2. Else, check if 'island' is Dream → predict Chinstrap (1)
3. Else (must be Torgersen), then check if 'culmen_depth_mm' <=18.0:
   a. If yes → Gentoo (2)
   b. If no → Chinstrap (1)

So the inner nodes are:

- Node 0: island == 'Biscoe'
- Node 1: culmen_depth_mm <= 18.0

Wait, but in the tree structure provided earlier, after Torgersen, it's a split on culmen depth. So when the island is not Biscoe or Dream (i.e., Torgersen), then check the culmen depth.

So nodes correspond to:

nodes[0] = (island == 'Biscoe') ? 1 : 0
But wait, in the example given earlier, nodes are a list of boolean values indicating whether each condition was met. So for our tree:

At level 1: if island is Biscoe → node[0] is True (1), else go to next condition.
If not Biscoe, check if island is Dream → node[1] would be the second condition? Wait, but in a decision tree, each split is based on a single feature. So perhaps I need to structure it as:

First, the root node splits on 'island' with three branches.

But since Python doesn't handle multi-way splits directly in such functions, we can structure it as nested if-else conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the nodes list should capture each condition as it's evaluated. Let me think about how to represent this.

In the example provided, there are two inner nodes: one for HbA1c_level and another for blood_glucose_level. Each node is a condition that may or may not be true as we go down the tree.

Similarly, in our case:

The first inner node is 'island' == 'Biscoe'. If True, prediction is 0.
If False, then check if 'island' == 'Dream'. If True, prediction is 1.
If both are False (so island must be Torgersen), then evaluate the second condition: culmen_depth_mm <=18.0. This becomes node[1].

Wait, but in terms of nodes as a list, each element represents whether that inner node's condition was met.

So perhaps:

nodes = [is_biscoe, is_dream, ...], but maybe we need to represent the path taken through the tree.

Alternatively, since it's a max depth of 2, there are up to two inner nodes. In this case:

- The first split is on 'island' (Biscoe). If yes → leaf node.
- Else, check if 'island' is Dream → another leaf.
- Else, go to the second condition: culmen_depth_mm.

But perhaps for the nodes list, it's better to represent each condition as we encounter them. So:

nodes[0] = (island == 'Biscoe') → True or False
If nodes[0] is True → prediction 0.
Else, check if island == 'Dream' → nodes[1] = (island == 'Dream'). If True → prediction 1.
Else, check culmen_depth_mm <=18.0 → nodes[2] = (culmen_depth_mm <=18.0). But since max depth is 2, perhaps we only need two conditions.

Wait, the example given had a tree of depth 2 but used two nodes in the list. So I think each split corresponds to an inner node, and the nodes list should track those splits as they occur.

In our case:

- First split: island == 'Biscoe' → nodes[0]
   - If True → Adelie
   - Else, proceed.
- Second condition within else: if island == 'Dream' → nodes[1] (since depth is 2)
   - But wait, the tree has a maximum depth of 2. So for Torgersen, which is the third option, we have another split based on culmen_depth_mm.

Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Perhaps it's better to structure the decision tree as:

if island == 'Biscoe':
   predict Adelie
else:
   if island == 'Dream':
      predict Chinstrap
   else:  # Torgersen
      if culmen_depth_mm <=18.0:
          predict Gentoo
      else:
          predict Chinstrap

So the inner nodes are:

1. island == 'Biscoe' → node[0]
2. culmen_depth_mm <=18.0 → node[1]

Because when we get to Torgersen, that's after checking Biscoe and Dream. So in the function:

nodes = [is_biscoe, is_culmen_depth_le_18]

But wait, 'island' can be checked once, but since it's a categorical variable with three options, perhaps the nodes list should represent each condition.

Alternatively, considering that after island is not Biscoe or Dream, then check culmen depth. So the nodes list would have two elements: whether the first condition (Biscoe) was met, and whether the second condition (culmen_depth) was met if applicable.

In code:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # since max depth is 2
    island = X['island']
    
    # First node: check if island is Biscoe
    nodes[0] = (island == 'Biscoe')
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0
    else:
        # Second condition for Torgersen branch
        culmen_depth = X['culmen_depth_mm']
        nodes[1] = (culmen_depth <= 18.0)
        if island == 'Dream':
            prediction = 1
        else:  # Torgersen
            if nodes[1]:
                prediction = 2
            else:
                prediction = 1

    return prediction, [int(nodes[0]), int(nodes[1])]

Wait, but in this code, when island is Dream, we set the prediction to 1 and never check the second node. So the nodes list would have [False, ...] for that path.

But according to the example given, each inner node's condition is evaluated as per the tree structure. So if the first condition (island == Biscoe) is False, then we evaluate the next conditions depending on island and culmen depth.

Alternatively, perhaps nodes should represent all the splits in the order they are checked.

Wait, in the example provided by the user:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["HbA1c_level"] <= 6.7
    nodes[1] = X["blood_glucose_level"] <= 210
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 1

    return prediction, [int(nodes[0]), int(nodes[1])]

In this case, both inner nodes are evaluated regardless of the path taken because nodes[0] and nodes[1] are set before any if conditions. But in our case, depending on island, some nodes may not be reached.

But according to the user's example, all inner node conditions are evaluated and stored in the nodes list. So perhaps I should follow that approach: evaluate all relevant conditions first, then make decisions based on them.

So for our problem:

nodes = [is_biscoe, is_culmen_depth_le_18]

Then, using these to determine prediction.

But how? Let's structure it as:

Evaluate both nodes upfront.

def predict(X):
    # Extract features
    island = X['island']
    culmen_depth = X['culmen_depth_mm']

    # First node: is island Biscoe?
    nodes = [False, False]
    nodes[0] = (island == 'Biscoe')

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0
    else:
        # Check if island is Dream
        if island == 'Dream':
            prediction = 1
        else:  # Torgersen
            # Second node: culmen_depth <=18?
            nodes[1] = (culmen_depth <= 18.0)
            if nodes[1]:
                prediction = 2
            else:
                prediction = 1

    return prediction, [int(nodes[0]), int(nodes[1])]

Wait, but in this code, when island is Dream, the second node isn't evaluated. So nodes[1] remains False (initialized as such). But in reality, for island=Dream, we don't need to check culmen_depth, so the second condition isn't part of the decision path.

However, according to the example given by the user, all inner nodes are evaluated upfront, which may not align with how a decision tree is traversed. So perhaps it's better to evaluate each node as needed.

But in the function, if we structure it such that for Torgersen, after checking island, we then check culmen_depth, then nodes list will have [False, True/False], accurately representing which conditions were met on the path taken.

Alternatively, to follow the example's approach, perhaps all inner nodes are evaluated before any decision is made. So even if some nodes aren't part of the decision path, their values are still computed and stored in the nodes list.

Wait, but that might not be necessary or accurate because in a decision tree, once you reach a leaf node, you don't evaluate further conditions. However, for the function's purpose, it seems the user wants all inner nodes' conditions to be evaluated and included in the nodes list as per their position in the tree structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each split corresponds to an inner node, regardless of whether they are on the same path or not. So since our decision tree has three splits (island at Biscoe/Dream/Torgersen), but only two splits are needed because Torgersen leads to another condition. So nodes list would have:

- Node 0: island == 'Biscoe'
- Node 1: culmen_depth_mm <=18.0

Thus, in code:

nodes = [is_biscoe, is_culmen_depth_le_18]

Then, if node[0] is True → prediction=0
Else:
   if node[1] → prediction=2
   else → prediction=1

Wait, but that doesn't account for the Dream island scenario. Because when island is Dream, we don't check culmen depth. So perhaps this approach isn't directly applicable.

This seems a bit tricky. Let me try to outline all possible cases:

Case 1: island = Biscoe → node[0] = True → prediction=0
→ nodes list: [True, ...], but since after Biscoe we don't check anything else, perhaps the second node isn't evaluated.

But according to the example function, both inner nodes are always evaluated and set. So in that case, even if island is Biscoe, culmen_depth would still be checked.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's structure it as follows:

Evaluate all necessary conditions upfront, then use them to determine the prediction, similar to how the example function does it.

So nodes list will have two elements: whether the island is Biscoe and whether culmen_depth_mm <=18.

But wait, for islands other than Torgersen, checking culmen_depth isn't part of the decision. So perhaps in those cases, the second node's condition isn't evaluated because it's not needed.

Alternatively, to simplify, evaluate both conditions upfront regardless of which path is taken, then determine prediction based on these nodes.

But that might not align with how a real decision tree works, where once you hit a leaf, you stop evaluating further conditions. However, the function provided by the user seems to evaluate all inner node conditions before making any decisions, perhaps for simplicity.

Given that, I think it's acceptable to evaluate both conditions upfront and then use them in determining the prediction, even if some paths don't require checking certain nodes.

So here's a possible structure:

def predict(X):
    island = X['island']
    culmen_depth = X['culmen_depth_mm']

    # First node: is it Biscoe?
    is_biscoe = (island == 'Biscoe')
    
    # Second node: for Torgersen branch, is culmen depth <=18?
    if island != 'Torgersen':
        # Not needed, but to align with example, let's set it anyway
        is_culmen_le_18 = False  # or perhaps not evaluate and set default
    else:
        is_culmen_le_18 = (culmen_depth <= 18.0)

    nodes = [is_biscoe, is_culmen_le_18]

    if is_biscoe:
        prediction = 0
    elif island == 'Dream':
        prediction = 1
    else:  # Torgersen
        if is_culmen_le_18:
            prediction = 2
        else:
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, [int(nodes[0]), int(nodes[1])]

Wait, but that might not correctly handle the nodes list because for Dream and Biscoe, we don't evaluate culmen_depth. So perhaps it's better to structure it as:

def predict(X):
    island = X['island']
    culmen_depth = X.get('culmen_depth_mm', 0)  # assuming it exists

    nodes = [False, False]

    if island == 'Biscoe':
        nodes[0] = True
        prediction = 0
    else:
        if island == 'Torgersen':
            nodes[1] = (culmen_depth <= 18.0)
            if nodes[1]:
                prediction = 2
            else:
                prediction = 1
        elif island == 'Dream':
            # No need for second node, but set it to False or don't evaluate?
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, [int(nodes[0]), int(nodes[1])]

But in this code, when island is Dream, nodes[1] remains False. However, according to the tree structure, when island is not Biscoe and not Torgersen (i.e., it's Dream), we don't check culmen_depth. So perhaps for non-Torgersen cases beyond Biscoe, we shouldn't evaluate nodes[1].

This is getting quite complicated. Maybe I should take a step back.

The goal is to create a function that returns the prediction and a list of two elements indicating whether each inner node's condition was met as per the decision path taken.

In our case:

- The first inner node is checking if island == 'Biscoe' → nodes[0]
   - If yes, prediction=0
- Else:
   - Check if island == 'Dream' → if yes, prediction=1. This doesn't involve any further inner nodes (since max depth is 2). But wait, in the tree structure, it's a leaf node after Biscoe.
   - Else, check culmen_depth_mm <=18 → this is the second inner node.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the tree structure. Maybe the decision tree is structured as:

Root
└─ island == 'Biscoe'? 
    yes: Adelie
    no:
        └─ culmen_depth_mm <=18?
            yes: Gentoo
            no: Chinstrap

But this doesn't account for the Dream scenario, which suggests that perhaps I misunderstood the problem.

Wait, looking back at the original question:

The user wants to build a decision tree of maximum depth 2. They have features about penguins (island, culmen length and depth, flipper length, etc.), but in their example code, they used island and culmen_depth_mm as the two splits.

So perhaps in their specific case, the tree is:

Root
└─ island == 'Biscoe'?
    yes: Adelie
    no:
        └─ culmen depth <= 18.0?
            yes: Gentoo
            no: Chinstrap

In this structure, the second split only happens if island is not Biscoe.

Thus, in code:

def predict(X):
    island = X['island']
    culmen_depth = X['culmen_depth_mm']

    nodes = [False, False]

    # First node
    nodes[0] = (island == 'Biscoe')
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        # Second node: check culmen depth
        nodes[1] = (culmen_depth <= 18.0)
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap

    return prediction, [int(nodes[0]), int(nodes[1])]

This aligns with the user's example and the max depth of 2.

But wait, in this structure, 'Dream' is treated as part of the no branch from Biscoe. So perhaps the data used doesn't include Dream, or it's grouped elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should assume that 'island' can be Biscoe, Dream, or Torgersen. But according to the example code, when island isn't Biscoe, then check culmen_depth.

But in reality, from the dataset description, there are three islands: Biscoe, Dream (which is actually called Cuverville?), but perhaps it's a typo and should be Torgersen or another.

Wait, no, the user's data seems to have 'island' with possible values including Biscoe, so perhaps in their case, after checking for Biscoe, everything else is treated as not Biscoe, regardless of whether it's Dream or another island. But that would mean that Dream and Torgersen are lumped together.

Alternatively, if the tree needs to consider Dream as a separate class, then my initial approach was incorrect because it doesn't account for that.

This is confusing. Perhaps I need to clarify based on the user's original problem statement.

Wait, in the user's question, they said: "I want you to act as a junior data scientist... Suppose we have a dataset of penguins." They provided some code and features like 'island', which can be Biscoe, etc. So I think that for their specific case, 'island' is used in the first split (Biscoe), and then culmen_depth_mm is used in the second split.

Thus, the structure of the decision tree is as follows:

1. Split on island == 'Biscoe'? If yes → Adelie.
2. Else, split on culmen_depth_mm <= 18.0? If yes → Gentoo, else → Chinstrap.

Therefore, the function should implement this logic.

So in code, it's straightforward: check if island is Biscoe first, then check culmen depth.

Thus, the nodes list will have:

- nodes[0]: True/False for island == 'Biscoe'
- nodes[1]: True/False for culmen_depth <=18.0 (only evaluated if island isn't Biscoe)

But according to the example function, all inner node conditions are evaluated upfront, even if they aren't part of the decision path.

However, in a real decision tree traversal, once you hit a leaf, you stop evaluating further splits. So perhaps it's better to evaluate nodes only as needed.

Given that, I think the code should be structured so that for each sample, only the necessary conditions are checked.

Thus:

def predict(X):
    island = X['island']
    culmen_depth = X.get('culmen_depth_mm')

    # Initialize nodes with default values
    nodes = [False, False]

    if island == 'Biscoe':
        prediction = 0
        nodes[0] = True
    else:
        nodes[1] = (culmen_depth <= 18.0) if culmen_depth is not None else False
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap

    return prediction, [int(nodes[0]), int(nodes[1])]

But wait, in this case, for samples where island == 'Biscoe', the second node isn't evaluated. So nodes[1] remains False.

This might be acceptable because according to the decision tree structure, once you determine that it's Biscoe, you don't proceed further.

However, when the user provided an example function, both inner node conditions were set before any if-else checks, leading me to think that perhaps all nodes are evaluated regardless of the path. But in reality, that's not how decision trees work.

Given this ambiguity, I think it's best to structure the code so that each condition is only evaluated when necessary. Therefore, for Biscoe samples, nodes[1] won't be checked and can remain False or undefined, but since we need to return a list of two booleans, perhaps we should set them as per the decision path.

Alternatively, considering that in the example function, all inner node conditions are evaluated upfront before any if-else checks. So for consistency with the user's approach, I'll structure it similarly: evaluate both nodes first, then decide based on their values.

But in this case, the code would look like:

def predict(X):
    island = X['island']
    culmen_depth = X.get('culmen_depth_mm', 0)

    # Evaluate conditions for all inner nodes
    is_biscoe = (island == 'Biscoe')
    if not is_biscoe:
        is_culmen_le_18 = (culmen_depth <= 18.0)
    else:
        is_culmen_le_18 = False

    # Determine prediction based on the nodes
    if is_biscoe:
        prediction = 0
    else:
        if is_culmen_le_18:
            prediction = 2
        else:
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, [int(is_biscoe), int(is_culmen_le_18)]

This way, the nodes are evaluated upfront based on whether they're needed. For Biscoe samples, is_culmen_le_18 isn't checked but is set to False.

But I'm not sure if that's correct according to decision tree logic. Typically, once a sample hits a leaf (like Biscoe), you don't evaluate further splits. However, for the sake of returning two nodes in the list, perhaps it's acceptable to include both conditions as per their availability.

Alternatively, another approach could be:

def predict(X):
    island = X['island']
    culmen_depth = X.get('culmen_depth_mm', 0)

    # Initialize all node flags
    is_biscoe = False
    is_culmen_le_18 = False

    if island == 'Biscoe':
        prediction = 0
        is_biscoe = True
    else:
        is_culmen_le_18 = (culmen_depth <= 18.0)
        if is_culmen_le_18:
            prediction = 2
        else:
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, [int(is_biscoe), int(is_culmen_le_18)]

This way, for non-Biscoe samples, both nodes are correctly set based on the actual evaluation.

I think this is a better approach because it accurately reflects which splits were actually used in determining the prediction. For Biscoe samples, only the first node's condition is evaluated and stored as True, while the second remains False since it wasn't checked.

To address your request for constructing a decision tree model of maximum depth 2 using the provided penguin dataset, we can structure the model based on the features `island` and `culmen_depth_mm`. The decision tree will first check if the penguin is from Biscoe Island. If not, it will then examine the culmen depth to classify between Gentoo and Chinstrap penguins.

### Approach
1. **Root Node**: Check if the penguin's island is Biscoe.
   - If true, classify as Adelie.
2. **Second Level Node**: For penguins not from Biscoe, check if their culmen depth is less than or equal to 18mm.
   - If true, classify as Gentoo.
   - If false, classify as Chinstrap.

### Solution Code
```python
def predict_penguin_species(X):
    island = X['island']
    culmen_depth = X.get('culmen_depth_mm', 0)  # Assuming the feature exists

    is_biscoe = (island == 'Biscoe')
    is_culmen_le_18 = False  # Default value for cases where it's not evaluated

    if is_biscoe:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        is_culmen_le_18 = (culmen_depth <= 18.0)
        if is_culmen_le_18:
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap

    return prediction, [int(is_biscoe), int(is_culmen_le_18)]
```

### Explanation
- **Root Check (is_biscoe)**: This is the first split in our decision tree. Penguins from Biscoe Island are classified as Adelie.
- **Second Split (culmen_depth)**: For penguins not from Biscoe, we evaluate their culmen depth to determine if they are Gentoo or Chinstrap.

This approach efficiently uses two levels of splits to classify the penguins accurately based on the given features.
