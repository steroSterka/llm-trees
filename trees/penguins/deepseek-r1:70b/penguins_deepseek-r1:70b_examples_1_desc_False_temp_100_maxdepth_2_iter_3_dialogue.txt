Alright, so I need to build a decision tree classifier for penguin species using the given features. The target is to classify whether a penguin is Adelie, Chinstrap, or Gentoo. The maximum depth allowed is 2, which means the tree can have at most two levels of splits after the root.

First, let me list out the features provided:

1. island (categorical: Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen)
2. culmen length (mm) (continuous)
3. culmen depth (mm) (continuous)
4. flipper length (mm) (continuous)
5. body mass (g) (continuous)
6. sex (binary: male/female)

Given that the maximum depth is 2, I can only have two levels of splits. So, the first split will be based on one feature, and then each branch from there can split again into another feature.

I think it's best to start with a feature that can give me a good initial separation between species. Since island is categorical and might inherently group certain species together, maybe starting with that makes sense. Alternatively, flipper length or culmen measurements could be significant since different penguin species have varying physical characteristics.

I'll begin by checking if 'island' can be the first split. I know that Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins inhabit different islands in Antarctica. For example:

- Biscoe and Torgersen Islands are known to have Gentoo and Chinstrap penguins.
- Dream Island might primarily have Chinstrap penguins.

So perhaps splitting by 'island' first could help separate some species. But since the maximum depth is 2, I need each subsequent split after the island to be based on another feature.

Wait, but if I split by 'island', and then from there use another feature for further splits, considering that Gentoo penguins are larger with longer flippers, maybe I can use flipper length as the next split. For example:

- If a penguin is from Biscoe or Torgersen, check their flipper length to determine if they're Gentoo (longer flippers) or Chinstrap.
- From Dream Island, since it's mostly Chinstrap, but there might be some Adelie as well, so perhaps body mass could help distinguish.

Alternatively, maybe using 'culmen length' as the first split. I know that culmen length can vary between species:

- Adelie: about 40-45 mm
- Chinstrap: slightly shorter or similar
- Gentoo: longer culmen

But I'm not entirely sure about these exact measurements without data.

Another approach could be to use 'flipper length' as the first split because it's a strong indicator for Gentoo penguins, who have longer flippers. So:

- Flipper length > 200 mm → Gentoo
- Flipper length <= 200 mm → Need to determine between Adelie and Chinstrap

Then, within that group, maybe use 'culmen depth' or 'island' as the next split. For example:

If flipper length is less than or equal to 200 mm, then check if they are from Biscoe or Torgersen Islands, which might be more likely to be Chinstrap. Dream Island could have Adelie.

But I'm not sure how accurate that would be without actual data. Alternatively, using 'culmen depth' as the second split:

- Culmen depth > 18 mm → Adelie
- Culmen depth <= 18 mm → Chinstrap

I think this makes sense because Adelie penguins tend to have deeper culmens than Chinstraps.

So putting it together:

1. First split on flipper length (mm) with a threshold of, say, 200 mm.
   - Flipper length > 200 → Gentoo
   - Else, proceed to next split

2. Second split on culmen depth (mm):
   - Culmen depth > 18 → Adelie
   - <= 18 → Chinstrap

This should classify all three species within a maximum depth of 2.

I need to ensure that the thresholds are accurate, but without data, I'm approximating based on known characteristics. Flipper length is a key feature for Gentoo, and culmen depth helps differentiate Adelie from Chinstrap.

Decision Tree for Penguin Species Classification:

1. **Root Node:**
   - Feature: flipper length (mm)
     - Split at 200 mm
       - If flipper length > 200 mm → Gentoo
       - Else, proceed to next level

2. **Second Level Nodes:**
   - For flipper length ≤ 200 mm:
     - Feature: culmen depth (mm)
       - Split at 18 mm
         - If culmen depth > 18 mm → Adelie
         - If culmen depth ≤ 18 mm → Chinstrap

This decision tree effectively classifies penguins into three species using two levels of splits, leveraging flipper length to identify Gentoo and culmen depth to distinguish between Adelie and Chinstrap.

Alright, I need to create a Python function that predicts the species of a penguin based on given features using a decision tree. The tree should have a maximum depth of two and use the most important features. 

First, I'll review the features provided: island, culmen_length_mm, culmen_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, and species as the target variable. The goal is to classify into Adelie (0), Chinstrap (1), or Gentoo (2).

Looking at the example decision tree, it uses flipper length and culmen depth for classification. It splits at 200 mm for flipper length to identify Gentoo penguins. For other cases, it splits at 18 mm for culmen depth to differentiate Adelie from Chinstrap.

I need to translate this logic into a Python function that takes a dictionary of features and returns the predicted species along with a list of truth values representing each inner node's condition.

So, I'll define two nodes: one checking if flipper_length_mm is greater than 200 mm, and another checking if culmen_depth_mm is greater than 18 mm. Based on these conditions, the function will determine the species.

I'll make sure to use the exact feature keys as provided and handle each condition properly, ensuring that Gentoo is correctly identified first, then distinguishing between Adelie and Chinstrap based on culmen depth.

Here's a Python function implementing your decision tree:

```python
def predict_penguin_species(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split: flipper_length_mm <= 200 mm
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] > 200
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    else:
        # Second split: culmen_depth_mm <= 18 mm
        nodes[1] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] > 18
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **First Split:** The root node checks whether the `flipper_length_mm` is greater than 200 mm. If true (1), the penguin is classified as Gentoo (species code: 2).
  
- **Second Split:** If the first condition is false (0), we then check the `culmen_depth_mm`. If it's greater than 18 mm, the penguin is classified as Adelie (species code: 0). Otherwise, it's classified as Chinstrap (species code: 1).

The function returns:
- The predicted species code.
- A list of truth values corresponding to the conditions checked at each inner node.

This function assumes that the input dictionary `X` contains all the necessary features with the correct keys and appropriate data types.
