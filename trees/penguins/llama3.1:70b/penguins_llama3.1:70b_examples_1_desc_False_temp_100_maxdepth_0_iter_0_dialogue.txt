Based on the provided features, I'll build a decision tree to classify penguin species. Here's my attempt:

|--- island == Biscoe
||--- class: Adelie
|--- island != Biscoe
||--- culmen length (mm) <= 46.5
|||--- class: Chinstrap
||--- culmen length (mm) > 46.5
|||--- flipper length (mm) <= 197
||||--- class: Gentoo
||||--- flipper length (mm) > 197
|||||--- class: Adelie

My reasoning is as follows:

* I started by using the "island" feature, as it seems to be a strong indicator of penguin species. Biscoe Island is primarily inhabited by Adelie penguins.
* For non-Biscoe islands, I used culmen length (mm) as the next splitting criterion. Chinstrap penguins tend to have shorter culmens compared to Gentoo and Adelie penguins.
* Within the group of non-Chinstrap penguins (i.e., culmen length > 46.5 mm), I used flipper length (mm) to further differentiate between Gentoo and Adelie penguins. Gentoo penguins tend to have shorter flippers compared to Adelie penguins.

Please note that this decision tree is based on my understanding of the features and their relationships with penguin species. The actual performance of this tree may vary depending on the underlying data distribution and quality.

Also, keep in mind that I didn't use the "sex" feature, as it's not clear how strongly it correlates with penguin species. If you provide more information about the relationship between sex and species, I can try to incorporate it into the decision tree.

Here is the decision tree as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3
    
    # Node 0: island == Biscoe (0)
    nodes[0] = X["island"] == 0
    
    # Node 1: culmen_length_mm <= 46.5
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 46.5
    
    # Node 2: flipper_length_mm <= 197
    nodes[2] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 197

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 2  # Gentoo
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Adelie

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

Note that I used the provided feature keys and encoding to build the decision tree. The function takes a dictionary `X` with the feature values as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted species (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

You can use this function like this:
```python
features = {
    "island": 0,
    "culmen_length_mm": 40,
    "culmen_depth_mm": 18,
    "flipper_length_mm": 180,
    "body_mass_g": 3500,
    "sex": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Adelie)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [1, 1, 1]
```
