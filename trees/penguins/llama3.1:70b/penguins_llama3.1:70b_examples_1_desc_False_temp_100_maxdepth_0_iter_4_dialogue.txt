Based on the provided features, I'll build a decision tree classifier to predict the species of penguins (Adelie / Chinstrap / Gentoo). Here's the induced decision tree:

Based on the provided features, I will build a decision tree to classify the species of penguins (Adelie / Chinstrap / Gentoo). Here is the induced decision tree:
>>>>>>> main

|--- island == Torgersen
||--- class: Adelie
|--- island != Torgersen
<<<<<<< HEAD
||--- flipper length (mm) <= 195.0
|||--- culmen depth (mm) <= 18.65
||||--- class: Chinstrap
|||--- culmen depth (mm) > 18.65
||||--- class: Gentoo
||--- flipper length (mm) > 195.0
|||--- class: Gentoo

The decision tree uses the following features in order of importance:

1. island (Torgersen is a strong indicator of Adelie penguins)
2. flipper length (mm) (separates Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins)
3. culmen depth (mm) (further separates Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins)

Note that the decision tree only uses three features out of the six provided, as the other features do not contribute significantly to the classification process.

Please let me know if you'd like me to explain any part of the decision tree or provide more information on how it was constructed!
=======
||--- culmen depth (mm) <= 17.65
|||--- flipper length (mm) <= 185
||||--- class: Gentoo
|||--- flipper length (mm) > 185
||||--- class: Chinstrap
||--- culmen depth (mm) > 17.65
|||--- sex == female
||||--- class: Adelie
|||--- sex == male
||||--- class: Gentoo

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* The first split is based on the island feature, with Torgersen being a clear indicator of Adelie penguins.
* For non-Torgersen islands, the next split is based on culmen depth. Penguins with a deeper culmen are more likely to be Gentoo or Chinstrap.
* Within this subset, flipper length becomes an important factor, with longer flippers indicating Chinstrap penguins.
* Finally, sex plays a role in distinguishing between Adelie and Gentoo penguins, with females being more likely to be Adelie.

Note that the decision tree is not exhaustive, and there might be other possible trees with similar performance. However, based on the provided features, this tree seems to capture some of the most important relationships between the variables.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:
>>>>>>> main

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
<<<<<<< HEAD
    nodes[0] = X["island"] == 2  # Torgersen island
    nodes[1] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 195.0
    nodes[2] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 18.65
    nodes[3] = X["flipper_length_mm"] > 195.0
    nodes[4] = False  # not used
=======
    nodes[0] = X["island"] == 2  # Torgersen
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 17.65
    nodes[2] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 185
    nodes[3] = X["sex"] == 1  # female
    nodes[4] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] > 17.65
>>>>>>> main

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
<<<<<<< HEAD
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
            else:
                prediction = 2  # Gentoo
        else:
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features as input and returns a tuple with two elements: the predicted class label (`0`: Adelie, `1`: Chinstrap, or `2`: Gentoo) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The list contains integers (`0` or `1`) instead of booleans for easier interpretation.

Note that I used the feature encodings provided to fill in the thresholds for the decision tree.

        if nodes[4]:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 0  # Adelie
            else:
                prediction = 2  # Gentoo
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 2  # Gentoo
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap

    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple with two elements: the predicted species (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo) and a list of truth values representing the inner nodes. The inner node values are converted to integers (0 or 1) before returning.

Note that I used the provided feature encodings and ranges to fill in the thresholds for the decision tree.
