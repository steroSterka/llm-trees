Based on the provided features, I'll build a decision tree classifier to predict the species of penguins (Adelie / Chinstrap / Gentoo). Here's the induced decision tree:

|--- island == Torgersen
||--- class: Adelie
|--- island != Torgersen
||--- flipper length (mm) <= 195.0
|||--- culmen depth (mm) <= 18.65
||||--- class: Chinstrap
|||--- culmen depth (mm) > 18.65
||||--- class: Gentoo
||--- flipper length (mm) > 195.0
|||--- class: Gentoo

The decision tree uses the following features in order of importance:

1. island (Torgersen is a strong indicator of Adelie penguins)
2. flipper length (mm) (separates Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins)
3. culmen depth (mm) (further separates Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins)

Note that the decision tree only uses three features out of the six provided, as the other features do not contribute significantly to the classification process.

Please let me know if you'd like me to explain any part of the decision tree or provide more information on how it was constructed!

Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["island"] == 2  # Torgersen island
    nodes[1] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 195.0
    nodes[2] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 18.65
    nodes[3] = X["flipper_length_mm"] > 195.0
    nodes[4] = False  # not used

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
            else:
                prediction = 2  # Gentoo
        else:
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features as input and returns a tuple with two elements: the predicted class label (`0`: Adelie, `1`: Chinstrap, or `2`: Gentoo) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The list contains integers (`0` or `1`) instead of booleans for easier interpretation.

Note that I used the feature encodings provided to fill in the thresholds for the decision tree.
