Based on the provided features, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict the species of penguins (Adelie / Chinstrap / Gentoo). Here's the resulting tree:

|--- culmen depth (mm) <= 18.45
||--- island = Torgersen
|||--- class: Adelie
||--- island != Torgersen
|||--- flipper length (mm) <= 190.00
||||--- class: Chinstrap
||||--- flipper length (mm) > 190.00
|||||--- class: Gentoo
|--- culmen depth (mm) > 18.45
||--- culmen length (mm) <= 48.50
|||--- class: Adelie
||--- culmen length (mm) > 48.50
|||--- flipper length (mm) <= 195.00
||||--- class: Chinstrap
||||--- flipper length (mm) > 195.00
|||||--- class: Gentoo

This decision tree uses the following features:

1. Culmen depth (mm)
2. Island
3. Flipper length (mm)
4. Culmen length (mm)

These features are used to classify penguins into one of three species: Adelie, Chinstrap, or Gentoo.

Here's a brief explanation of each node in the tree:

* The root node splits on culmen depth (mm), which is an important feature for distinguishing between Adelie and non-Adelie penguins.
* For penguins with culmen depth <= 18.45 mm, the next split depends on the island. Torgersen Island is a strong indicator of Adelie penguins.
* For penguins with culmen depth > 18.45 mm, the next split depends on culmen length (mm). Penguins with shorter culmen lengths are more likely to be Adelie.
* The final splits rely on flipper length (mm) to distinguish between Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins.

Please note that this decision tree is induced based on the provided features and may not represent the optimal solution. Additional data or feature engineering might improve the accuracy of the classification model.

Here is the Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: culmen depth (mm) <= 18.45
    nodes[0] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 18.45
    
    # Node 1: island == Torgersen
    nodes[1] = X["island"] == 2
    
    # Node 2: flipper length (mm) <= 190.00
    nodes[2] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 190.00
    
    # Node 3: culmen length (mm) <= 48.50
    nodes[3] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 48.50
    
    # Node 4: flipper length (mm) <= 195.00
    nodes[4] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 195.00

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
            else:
                prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
            else:
                prediction = 2  # Gentoo
                
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values. The function returns a tuple containing the predicted species (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo) and a list of truth values for each inner node in the decision tree.

Note that I've used the provided feature encodings to fill in the thresholds in the decision tree. Also, I've assumed that the `island` feature is encoded as an integer (0 = Biscoe, 1 = Dream, 2 = Torgersen).
