Based on the provided features, I will induce a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 to classify the species of penguins (Adelie / Chinstrap / Gentoo).

First, I'll analyze the features and their importance. Since we don't have explicit labels for feature importance, I'll use my discretion to select the most relevant features.

**Selected Features:**

1. Culmen length (mm)
2. Flipper length (mm)

These two features are likely to be important in distinguishing between penguin species, as they relate to physical characteristics that may vary significantly across species.

**Decision Tree:**
```
|--- culmen length (mm) <= 44.5
||--- class: Adelie
|--- culmen length (mm) > 44.5
||--- flipper length (mm) <= 205.0
|||--- class: Chinstrap
||--- flipper length (mm) > 205.0
|||--- class: Gentoo
```
Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* If the culmen length is less than or equal to 44.5 mm, the penguin is likely an Adelie.
* If the culmen length is greater than 44.5 mm, we need to consider the flipper length.
	+ If the flipper length is less than or equal to 205.0 mm, the penguin is likely a Chinstrap.
	+ If the flipper length is greater than 205.0 mm, the penguin is likely a Gentoo.

Please note that this decision tree is induced based on general assumptions about the features and may not be optimal for your specific dataset. For more accurate results, I recommend training a decision tree classifier using a machine learning library with your actual data.

Here's the Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the species of a penguin based on its features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values.
            'island': 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica (0 = Biscoe / 1 = Dream / 2 = Torgersen)
            'culmen_length_mm': The culmen is the upper ridge of a bird’s bill. This feature is the length of the culmen in mm.
            'culmen_depth_mm': The culmen is the upper ridge of a bird’s bill. This feature is the depth of the culmen in mm.
            'flipper_length_mm': Flipper length in mm.
            'body_mass_g': Body Mass Index
            'sex': (0 = nan / 1 = female / 2 = male)

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the predicted species and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

    Note:
        The target variable encoding is as follows:
            species: penguin species (0 = Adelie / 1 = Chinstrap / 2 = Gentoo)
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Check if culmen length is less than or equal to 44.5 mm
    nodes[0] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 44.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        # Check if flipper length is less than or equal to 205.0 mm
        nodes[1] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205.0
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, which contains the feature values for a penguin. The function uses these features to predict the species of the penguin and returns the predicted species along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

You can use this function by passing in a dictionary containing the feature values for a penguin. For example:

```python
X = {
    "island": 0,
    "culmen_length_mm": 40.5,
    "culmen_depth_mm": 17.2,
    "flipper_length_mm": 190.0,
    "body_mass_g": 3500.0,
    "sex": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Predicted species:", prediction)  # Output: Predicted species: 0 (Adelie)
print("Inner node values:", nodes)  # Output: Inner node values: [True, None]
```
