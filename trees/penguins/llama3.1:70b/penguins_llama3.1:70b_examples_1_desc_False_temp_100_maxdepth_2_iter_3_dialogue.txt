Based on the provided features, I will induce a decision tree classifier to predict the species of penguins (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo). Here's the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2:

|--- island == Torgersen
||--- class: Adelie
|--- island != Torgersen
||--- flipper length (mm) <= 195.5
|||--- class: Gentoo
||--- flipper length (mm) > 195.5
|||--- class: Chinstrap

Explanation:

1. The first split is based on the feature "island". Penguins from Torgersen island are mostly Adelie, so this branch can be classified as Adelie.
2. For non-Torgersen islands, the next most important feature is "flipper length (mm)". Gentoo penguins tend to have shorter flippers, so if flipper length is less than or equal to 195.5 mm, it's likely a Gentoo penguin.
3. If flipper length is greater than 195.5 mm, it's likely a Chinstrap penguin.

Note that this decision tree uses the most important features (island and flipper length) to make predictions with a maximum depth of 2.

Here is the Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes for the penguin species classification:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split: island == Torgersen (island value 2)
    nodes[0] = X["island"] == 2
    
    # Second split: flipper length <= 195.5 mm for Gentoo, otherwise Chinstrap
    nodes[1] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 195.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values. The function returns a tuple containing the predicted species (as an integer: 0 for Adelie, 1 for Chinstrap, and 2 for Gentoo) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Note that I've used the encoded values for the `island` feature as specified in the problem description. Also, I've chosen a threshold value of 195.5 mm for the `flipper_length_mm` feature based on the decision tree structure.
