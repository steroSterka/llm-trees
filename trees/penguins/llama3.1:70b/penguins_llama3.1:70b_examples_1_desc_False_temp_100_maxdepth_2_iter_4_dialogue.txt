To build a decision tree classifier with the given features to classify penguin species into Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo, we first need to understand the importance of each feature. However, without access to specific data or a method to evaluate feature importance (like mutual information, correlation analysis, or recursive feature elimination), I'll proceed based on general knowledge about such datasets.

Typically, in biological datasets like this one:

- **Island** might be significant as different species may have habitats in different islands.
- **Culmen length and depth**, along with **flipper length**, are morphological features that can significantly differ among species.
- **Body mass** could also vary significantly across species.
- **Sex** is less likely to directly influence the classification of species but might have some effect due to sexual dimorphism.

Given these considerations, for a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, we'll prioritize features based on their general importance in distinguishing between penguin species:

1. **Culmen length (mm)**: This feature is often quite distinctive among different penguin species.
2. **Flipper length (mm)**: Flipper length can also be significantly different among species.

Let's hypothesize a decision tree structure without access to the actual data for precise thresholds and outcomes:

Decision Tree:
|--- culmen length (mm) <= X
||--- class: Adelie
|--- culmen length (mm) > X
||--- flipper length (mm) <= Y
|||--- class: Chinstrap
||--- flipper length (mm) > Y
|||--- class: Gentoo

**Note**: 
- **X** and **Y** would be specific values that the decision tree algorithm determines based on the dataset, such as mean or median thresholds.
- This is a simplified example. Real-world datasets might require more complex trees or additional features for accurate classification.

This structure assumes that culmen length can initially separate Adelie penguins from others (assuming they have distinctively shorter or longer culmens compared to the range of other species), and then flipper length further distinguishes between Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins. The actual performance would depend on the dataset's specifics, such as distribution of features among species and how well these morphological traits distinguish between them.

Here's the decision tree as a Python function based on your features and target variable:


```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Decision Tree Classifier for Penguin Species.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing feature values.
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A prediction of penguin species (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)
           and a list representing the truth values of inner nodes.
    """
    
    # Initialize node values
    nodes = [None] * 2
    
    # First split on culmen length in mm
    # Assuming Adelies have shorter culmens compared to other species (mean around 43-45mm)
    nodes[0] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 44.5
    
    # Second split on flipper length in mm for non-Adelie penguins
    # This threshold might not be ideal and should be replaced with actual data-driven thresholds
    nodes[1] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 193

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    
    return prediction, nodes


# Example usage
X = {
    "island": 0,
    "culmen_length_mm": 43.5,
    "culmen_depth_mm": 21.5,
    "flipper_length_mm": 190,
    "body_mass_g": 3700,
    "sex": 2,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Species classification
print("Node Truth Values:", nodes)

```

Remember that the thresholds used here (e.g., `44.5` for culmen length and `193` for flipper length) are placeholders based on general assumptions about penguin morphology. For accurate predictions, these values should be determined from actual data analysis using techniques like cross-validation to find optimal splits or by consulting with experts in ornithology or wildlife biology.
