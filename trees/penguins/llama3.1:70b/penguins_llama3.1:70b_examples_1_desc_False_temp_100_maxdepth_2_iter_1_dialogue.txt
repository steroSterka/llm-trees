Based on the features you provided, I'll build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 to classify the species of penguins (Adelie / Chinstrap / Gentoo).

After analyzing the features, I've identified the most important ones for the classification task. Here is the induced decision tree:

|--- island
||--- Biscoe or Dream
|||--- culmen length (mm) <= 45.5
||||--- class: Adelie
|||--- culmen length (mm) > 45.5
||||--- class: Chinstrap
||--- Torgersen
||||--- class: Gentoo

This decision tree uses the island feature as the primary splitter, which makes sense since different islands have different penguin populations. The secondary splitter is culmen length (mm), which helps distinguish between Adelie and Chinstrap penguins.

Note that this decision tree is a simplified model and may not capture all the complexities of the data. However, it should provide a reasonable starting point for classification tasks.

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning behind each split:

1. **Island**: The island feature is used as the primary splitter because different islands have distinct penguin populations.
	* Biscoe and Dream islands are grouped together, as they both have Adelie and Chinstrap penguins.
	* Torgersen island is a separate group, as it primarily has Gentoo penguins.
2. **Culmen length (mm)**: This feature is used as the secondary splitter to distinguish between Adelie and Chinstrap penguins on Biscoe and Dream islands.
	* Culmen length <= 45.5 mm is more characteristic of Adelie penguins.
	* Culmen length > 45.5 mm is more characteristic of Chinstrap penguins.

Please note that this decision tree may not be the only possible solution, and other features or combinations of features could also lead to effective classification models.

Here is the Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes for the decision tree I previously induced:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["island"] in [0, 1]  # Biscoe or Dream islands
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the feature keys as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted species (as an integer: 0 for Adelie, 1 for Chinstrap, 2 for Gentoo) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The nodes are evaluated in the following order:

1. `island` is either Biscoe or Dream (nodes[0])
2. `culmen_length_mm` is less than or equal to 45.5 mm (nodes[1])

Note that I used meaningful threshold values based on the feature descriptions and ranges provided.
