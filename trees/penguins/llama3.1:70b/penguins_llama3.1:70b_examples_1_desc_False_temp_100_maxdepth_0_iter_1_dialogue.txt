Based on the provided features, I will build a decision tree to classify penguin species. Here's the resulting decision tree:

|--- island == Torgersen
||--- class: Adelie
|--- island != Torgersen
||--- culmen depth (mm) <= 18.35
|||--- class: Chinstrap
||--- culmen depth (mm) > 18.35
|||--- flipper length (mm) <= 205.00
||||--- class: Adelie
||||--- flipper length (mm) > 205.00
|||||--- class: Gentoo

Note that this decision tree is not unique and might vary based on the specific dataset used for training. However, it provides a reasonable classification model using the given features.

Here's an explanation of how I arrived at this decision tree:

1. Island feature: Penguins from Torgersen island are primarily Adelie penguins.
2. Culmen depth feature: Chinstrap penguins tend to have relatively shallower culmens compared to other species.
3. Flipper length feature: Gentoo penguins generally have longer flippers than Adelie and Chinstrap penguins.

Please provide the dataset for further refinement or evaluation of this decision tree.

Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree for penguin species classification:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the penguin species based on the given features.

    Args:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values.
        - 'island': The island where the penguin was found (0 = Biscoe, 1 = Dream, 2 = Torgersen)
        - 'culmen_length_mm': The length of the culmen in mm
        - 'culmen_depth_mm': The depth of the culmen in mm
        - 'flipper_length_mm': Flipper length in mm
        - 'body_mass_g': Body Mass Index
        - 'sex': (0 = nan, 1 = female, 2 = male)

    Returns:
    prediction (int): The predicted penguin species (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)
    nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes
    """
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["island"] == 2  # Torgersen island
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 18.35  # Culmen depth threshold
    nodes[2] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205.00  # Flipper length threshold

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Adelie
            else:
                prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

Example usage:

```python
features = {
    "island": 1,
    "culmen_length_mm": 45.0,
    "culmen_depth_mm": 17.5,
    "flipper_length_mm": 200.0,
    "body_mass_g": 3500.0,
    "sex": 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Predicted species:", prediction)  # Output: Predicted species: 1 (Chinstrap)
print("Inner node truth values:", nodes)  # Output: Inner node truth values: [0, 1, 1]
```
