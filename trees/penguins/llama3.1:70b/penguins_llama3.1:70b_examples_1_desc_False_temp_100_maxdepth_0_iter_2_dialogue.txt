Based on the features you provided for penguins, I will build a decision tree classifier to predict the species of penguin (Adelie / Chinstrap / Gentoo). Here is the decision tree:

|--- island == Torgersen
||--- class: Adelie
|--- island != Torgersen
||--- flipper length (mm) <= 189.0
|||--- culmen depth (mm) <= 18.45
||||--- class: Chinstrap
|||--- culmen depth (mm) > 18.45
||||--- class: Gentoo
||--- flipper length (mm) > 189.0
|||--- body mass (g) <= 3950.0
||||--- class: Adelie
|||--- body mass (g) > 3950.0
||||--- class: Gentoo

Note that this decision tree is based on the features you provided, but the actual importance of each feature may vary depending on the specific dataset and the relationships between the features.

Here's a brief explanation of how I built the tree:

* I started by selecting the most important feature, which in this case was "island". Torgersen island has only Adelie penguins, so it's a clear separator.
* For the non-Torgersen islands, I selected "flipper length" as the next feature. Flipper length is a good discriminator between Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins.
* Within the flipper length <= 189.0 branch, I used "culmen depth" to separate Chinstrap from Gentoo penguins.
* Within the flipper length > 189.0 branch, I used "body mass" to separate Adelie from Gentoo penguins.

Please note that this is just one possible decision tree, and there may be other valid trees depending on the specific dataset and the relationships between the features.

Here is the decision tree as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["island"] == 2  # Torgersen island
    nodes[1] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 189.0
    nodes[2] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 18.45
    nodes[3] = X["body_mass_g"] <= 3950.0
    nodes[4] = X["island"] != 2  # Not Torgersen island

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
            else:
                prediction = 2  # Gentoo
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 0  # Adelie
            else:
                prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values. The function returns a tuple containing the predicted species (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Note that I used integer values for the nodes to match the target variable encoding.
