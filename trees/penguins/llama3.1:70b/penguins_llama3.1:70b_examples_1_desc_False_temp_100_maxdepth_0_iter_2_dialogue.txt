Based on the provided features for penguin classification, I'll build a decision tree using the most important features. Since this is a hypothetical scenario and we don't have actual data to calculate feature importance or train a model, I will make educated guesses based on general knowledge about penguins and common practices in machine learning.

Here's my attempt at building a decision tree classifier for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguin species:

Decision Tree:
|--- flipper length (mm) <= 195
||--- island = Biscoe or Dream
|||--- culmen depth (mm) <= 18.5
||||--- class: Adelie
|||--- culmen depth (mm) > 18.5
||||--- class: Chinstrap
||--- island = Torgersen
|||--- sex = male
||||--- class: Gentoo
|||--- sex = female
||||--- body mass (g) <= 5500
|||||--- class: Adelie
|||||--- body mass (g) > 5500
|||||--- class: Gentoo

This decision tree takes into account the following features:

1. Flipper length (mm): Generally, Gentoo penguins have longer flippers than Adelie and Chinstrap penguins.
2. Island: The island feature is used to distinguish between Adelie/Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins, as some islands are more likely to be inhabited by certain species.
3. Culmen depth (mm): Chinstrap penguins tend to have deeper culmens than Adelie penguins.
4. Sex: Gentoo penguins often have a larger body mass than Adelie penguins, and this is particularly noticeable in males.

Please note that this decision tree is highly hypothetical and may not accurately reflect real-world data or classification results. In practice, you would need to collect actual data on these features for each species and train a machine learning model (such as a Decision Tree Classifier from scikit-learn) using techniques like feature selection, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.

Feel free to provide more context or clarify any assumptions I've made!

Based on the provided features and target variable, I've created a Python function that predicts the species of penguins based on the decision tree. Here's the code:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 195
    nodes[1] = X["island"] in [0, 1]  # Biscoe or Dream
    nodes[2] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 18.5
    nodes[3] = X["island"] == 2  # Torgersen
    nodes[4] = X["sex"] == 2  # male
    nodes[5] = X["body_mass_g"] <= 5500

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Adelie
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 2  # Gentoo
                else:
                    if nodes[5]:
                        prediction = 0  # Adelie
                    else:
                        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the features as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted species (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The boolean values are converted to integers (0 or 1) for simplicity.

Note that I've used threshold values based on general knowledge about penguins, but these may not be accurate in real-world scenarios. In practice, you would need to collect actual data and train a machine learning model to determine the optimal thresholds.
