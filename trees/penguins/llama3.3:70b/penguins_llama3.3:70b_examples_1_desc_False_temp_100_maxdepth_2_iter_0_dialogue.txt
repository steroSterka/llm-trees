To build a decision tree classifier for the species of penguins (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo) based on the given features and to ensure it has a maximum depth of 2, we will use Python with its scikit-learn library. However, since you've provided two different sets of features but want us to focus on the second set for classifying penguin species, we'll proceed with the understanding that the first set was just an example.

Here are the steps and code to create a decision tree classifier:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Example dataset for penguins (this is fictional data for demonstration purposes)
data = {
    'island': ['Biscoe', 'Dream', 'Torgersen', 'Biscoe', 'Dream', 'Torgersen',
               'Biscoe', 'Dream', 'Torgersen', 'Biscoe', 'Dream', 'Torgersen'],
    'culmen_length_mm': [40, 38, 41, 39, 37, 42, 40, 38, 41, 39, 37, 42],
    'culmen_depth_mm': [18, 19, 17, 18, 19, 17, 18, 19, 17, 18, 19, 17],
    'flipper_length_mm': [190, 180, 200, 195, 185, 205, 192, 182, 202, 194, 186, 204],
    'body_mass_g': [3700, 3600, 3900, 3750, 3650, 3950, 3720, 3620, 3920, 3760, 3660, 3960],
    'sex': ['male', 'female', 'male', 'female', 'male', 'female', 'male', 'female', 'male', 'female', 'male', 'female'],
    'species': ['Adelie', 'Chinstrap', 'Gentoo', 'Adelie', 'Chinstrap', 'Gentoo',
                'Adelie', 'Chinstrap', 'Gentoo', 'Adelie', 'Chinstrap', 'Gentoo']
}

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert categorical variables into numerical variables
df['island'] = df['island'].map({'Biscoe': 0, 'Dream': 1, 'Torgersen': 2})
df['sex'] = df['sex'].map({'male': 0, 'female': 1})

# Define features and target
X = df[['island', 'culmen_length_mm', 'culmen_depth_mm', 'flipper_length_mm', 'body_mass_g', 'sex']]
y = df['species'].map({'Adelie': 0, 'Chinstrap': 1, 'Gentoo': 2})

# Split dataset into training set and test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=1)

# Create Decision Tree classifier
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2, random_state=1)

# Train the model
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Model Accuracy: how often is the classifier correct?
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# To visualize or understand the decision tree structure with max depth 2,
# you can export it to a dot file and then convert it into an image.
from sklearn.tree import export_graphviz
export_graphviz(clf, out_file='penguin_tree.dot', 
                feature_names=['island', 'culmen_length_mm', 'culmen_depth_mm', 'flipper_length_mm', 'body_mass_g', 'sex'],
                class_names=['Adelie', 'Chinstrap', 'Gentoo'], filled=True)

# You would then need to convert the dot file into an image using Graphviz.
```

This code creates a decision tree classifier for penguin species based on the provided features. The `max_depth=2` parameter ensures that the tree does not grow beyond two levels of decisions, which can help prevent overfitting and make the model easier to interpret.

To visualize the actual tree structure as requested (akin to your example), you would need to convert the `.dot` file generated by the `export_graphviz` function into an image using Graphviz. The resulting image would show the decision-making process of the classifier, including the features used at each split and the predicted class labels.

Please note that for real-world applications, it's essential to have a larger and more diverse dataset to achieve reliable results. This example is simplified for educational purposes.

Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree function in Python that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict_penguin_species(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the penguin species based on the given features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the features.
        - island (int): The island where the penguin was found (0 = Biscoe, 1 = Dream, 2 = Torgersen)
        - culmen_length_mm (float): The length of the culmen in mm
        - culmen_depth_mm (float): The depth of the culmen in mm
        - flipper_length_mm (float): The length of the flipper in mm
        - body_mass_g (float): The body mass of the penguin in grams
        - sex (int): The sex of the penguin (0 = nan, 1 = female, 2 = male)
    
    Returns:
    prediction (int): The predicted species of the penguin (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)
    nodes (list): A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes
    """
    
    # Initialize the nodes list with None values
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the culmen length is less than or equal to 39 mm
    nodes[0] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 39
    
    # Node 1: Check if the flipper length is less than or equal to 195 mm
    nodes[1] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 195
    
    # Make predictions based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    
    # Convert boolean values to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
features = {
    "island": 0,
    "culmen_length_mm": 38.5,
    "culmen_depth_mm": 18.2,
    "flipper_length_mm": 190,
    "body_mass_g": 3700,
    "sex": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict_penguin_species(features)
print("Predicted species:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)

```

This decision tree uses the following rules:

- If the culmen length is less than or equal to 39 mm, it checks the flipper length.
  - If the flipper length is less than or equal to 195 mm, it predicts Adelie (0).
  - Otherwise, it predicts Chinstrap (1).
- If the culmen length is greater than 39 mm, it predicts Gentoo (2).

Note that these thresholds are arbitrary and may need to be adjusted based on the actual data distribution.
