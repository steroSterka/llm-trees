To build a decision tree for classifying penguin species based on the given features and with a maximum depth of 2, we first need to understand that the most important features will be selected based on their ability to distinguish between Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins. Given the features are:

1. island (Biscoe / Dream / Torgersen)
2. culmen length (mm)
3. culmen depth (mm)
4. flipper length (mm)
5. body mass (g)
6. sex (male / female)

A decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 means we have one level of splitting below the root node, which implies we can use up to two features for classification.

The example you provided initially seems to refer to classifying Iris flowers into setosa, versicolor, and virginica based on sepal and petal dimensions. However, when applying this logic to penguins, we'd focus on characteristics that significantly differentiate Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo species.

Adelie penguins are known for being the smallest of the three, with a distinctive white ring surrounding their eyes. Chinstrap penguins have a thin black stripe under their chin, hence the name. Gentoo penguins are larger and have distinctive white stripes on their heads.

Given these physical characteristics and the features provided:

- **Island** can be an important factor because each species might have a preference or higher likelihood of being found on certain islands.
- **Culmen length** and **culmen depth** (which relate to the shape and size of the penguin's bill) can also distinguish between species, as these physical attributes vary among them.
- **Flipper length** is crucial because it directly affects swimming efficiency, which might differ among species due to their distinct habitats and feeding behaviors.
- **Body mass** is a clear indicator of size differences among the species.
- **Sex** might not be as directly influential in distinguishing between these three species since the characteristics that define each species are generally more consistent across sexes within a species.

For simplicity, let's assume we're using island and body mass (g) as our primary features for the decision tree because these can significantly distinguish between the species:

Decision Tree:
|--- body mass (g) <= 3700
||--- class: Adelie
|--- body mass (g) > 3700
||--- island == Torgersen
|||--- class: Chinstrap
||--- island != Torgersen
|||--- class: Gentoo

This simplified tree uses body mass as the primary discriminator at the first level, recognizing that Adelie penguins are generally smaller. At the second level, it uses the island to differentiate between Chinstrap (more likely found on Torgersen) and Gentoo penguins.

Please note, this is a highly simplified example and actual classification models would require more data, possibly incorporating all features in a balanced way to achieve higher accuracy. The decision boundaries (e.g., 3700g for body mass) are hypothetical and based on the premise of the question rather than real-world data analysis.

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting penguin species based on the given features. This function takes in a dictionary `X` with keys corresponding to the feature names and returns a tuple containing the predicted species (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict_penguin_species(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the penguin species based on the given features using a decision tree.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing the feature values. The keys should match the following:
        - 'island': Island where the penguin was found (0 = Biscoe, 1 = Dream, 2 = Torgersen)
        - 'culmen_length_mm': Length of the culmen in mm
        - 'culmen_depth_mm': Depth of the culmen in mm
        - 'flipper_length_mm': Flipper length in mm
        - 'body_mass_g': Body mass in grams
        - 'sex': Sex of the penguin (0 = nan, 1 = female, 2 = male)
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the predicted species (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """

    # Initialize the inner nodes with None
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Define the conditions for the inner nodes
    # Node 0: Check if the body mass is less than or equal to 3700 grams (a rough threshold to distinguish Adelie from other species)
    nodes[0] = X['body_mass_g'] <= 3700
    
    # Node 1: Check if the island is Torgersen (2) which might be more commonly associated with Chinstrap penguins
    nodes[1] = X['island'] == 2

    # Make predictions based on the inner nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        # If the body mass is less than or equal to 3700 grams, predict Adelie
        prediction = 0
    else:
        # If the body mass is more than 3700 grams and the island is Torgersen, predict Chinstrap
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        # Otherwise, predict Gentoo
        else:
            prediction = 2

    # Convert boolean node values to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes


# Example usage:
example_penguin = {
    'island': 2,
    'culmen_length_mm': 40,
    'culmen_depth_mm': 20,
    'flipper_length_mm': 200,
    'body_mass_g': 3500,
    'sex': 1
}

predicted_species, node_values = predict_penguin_species(example_penguin)
print(f"Predicted species: {predicted_species}")
print(f"Node values: {node_values}")

```

This code defines a decision tree that first checks if the body mass is less than or equal to 3700 grams. If so, it predicts Adelie. Otherwise, it checks if the island is Torgersen (2) and predicts Chinstrap if true; otherwise, it predicts Gentoo. The `nodes` list contains boolean values representing whether each inner node condition was met, converted to integers for simplicity.
