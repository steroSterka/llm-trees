To build a decision tree classifier for the species of penguins based on the provided features, we first need to understand that the example given initially relates to classifying iris flowers into their species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on flower characteristics. However, our task involves classifying penguins into their species (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo) using different features.

Given the features:
- island (Biscoe / Dream / Torgersen)
- culmen length (mm)
- culmen depth (mm)
- flipper length (mm)
- body mass (g)
- sex (male / female)

And considering we want to build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, we will prioritize the most distinguishing features for the classification.

**Note:** Without actual data or a way to compute feature importance directly in this response, I'll make an educated guess based on common practices in similar problems. Typically, physical measurements (like culmen length, culmen depth, flipper length, and body mass) are more informative for species classification than location (island) or sex due to the variability within species.

Here's a hypothetical decision tree that could classify penguins into Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo with a maximum depth of 2:

1. **Root Node:** Flipper length (mm)
   - **Condition:** flipper length <= 190 mm
     - This condition might primarily capture Adelie and possibly some Chinstrap penguins, as they generally have shorter flippers compared to Gentoos.
   - **Condition:** flipper length > 190 mm
     - This could potentially capture Gentoo penguins, which are known for having longer flippers.

2. **First Level Nodes:**
   - For flipper length <= 190 mm:
     - **Node Condition:** culmen depth (mm) <= 18.5 mm
       - Class: Adelie (assuming Adelies have relatively shallower culmen depths)
     - **Node Condition:** culmen depth (mm) > 18.5 mm
       - Class: Chinstrap (considering Chinstraps might have deeper culmen on average than Adelies but not as deep or as long flippers as Gentoos)
   - For flipper length > 190 mm:
     - **Node Condition:** body mass (g) <= 5200 g
       - Class: Gentoo (assuming a lighter Gentoo, though this is speculative without data)
     - **Node Condition:** body mass (g) > 5200 g
       - Class: Gentoo (heavier Gentoos, acknowledging that Gentoo penguins can vary significantly in size)

**Decision Tree Summary:**

|--- flipper length (mm) <= 190
||--- culmen depth (mm) <= 18.5
|||--- class: Adelie
||--- culmen depth (mm) > 18.5
|||--- class: Chinstrap
|--- flipper length (mm) > 190
||--- body mass (g) <= 5200
|||--- class: Gentoo
||--- body mass (g) > 5200
|||--- class: Gentoo

Please note, this decision tree is highly speculative without actual data to analyze and might not accurately reflect real-world classifications. Feature importance and optimal thresholds can only be determined through analysis of a dataset containing these features for each penguin species.

Here's the Python function that represents the decision tree for classifying penguins based on their features:

```python
def predict_penguin(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the species of a penguin based on its characteristics.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the features of the penguin.
            - 'island': The island where the penguin was found (0 = Biscoe, 1 = Dream, 2 = Torgersen)
            - 'culmen_length_mm': The length of the penguin's culmen in mm
            - 'culmen_depth_mm': The depth of the penguin's culmen in mm
            - 'flipper_length_mm': The length of the penguin's flipper in mm
            - 'body_mass_g': The body mass of the penguin in grams
            - 'sex': The sex of the penguin (0 = nan, 1 = female, 2 = male)

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the predicted species (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """

    # Initialize the nodes with None
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Node 0: Check if the flipper length is less than or equal to 200 mm
    nodes[0] = X['flipper_length_mm'] <= 200

    # Node 1: Check if the culmen depth is less than or equal to 18.5 mm
    nodes[1] = X['culmen_depth_mm'] <= 18.5

    # Make predictions based on the node values
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    # Convert boolean nodes to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes


# Example usage
X = {
    'island': 0,
    'culmen_length_mm': 40,
    'culmen_depth_mm': 18,
    'flipper_length_mm': 190,
    'body_mass_g': 4000,
    'sex': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict_penguin(X)
print(f"Predicted species: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This code defines a function `predict_penguin` that takes a dictionary `X` containing the features of a penguin and returns a tuple with the predicted species (0 for Adelie, 1 for Chinstrap, 2 for Gentoo) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The example usage demonstrates how to use this function with a sample input dictionary `X`.
