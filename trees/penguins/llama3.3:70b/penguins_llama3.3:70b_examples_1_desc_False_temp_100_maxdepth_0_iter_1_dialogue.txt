To build a decision tree for classifying penguin species (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo) based on the given features, we'll follow a step-by-step approach. However, without actual data, I'll provide a hypothetical decision tree based on general knowledge about these features and how they might distinguish between penguin species.

Given Features:
1. island (Biscoe / Dream / Torgersen)
2. culmen length (mm)
3. culmen depth (mm)
4. flipper length (mm)
5. body mass (g)
6. sex (male / female)

Decision Tree Hypothesis:

- **Island** can be a strong feature because different species of penguins tend to inhabit different islands or regions.
- **Culmen length and depth**, as well as **flipper length**, are physical characteristics that can vary significantly between species.
- **Body mass** is another distinguishing factor, with different species having different average weights.
- **Sex** might not be as directly influential in distinguishing between species but could interact with other features.

Decision Tree:
```
|--- island == Torgersen
||--- class: Adelie (Torgersen Island is known for its Adelie penguin population)
|--- island != Torgersen
||--- flipper length (mm) <= 190
|||--- class: Chinstrap (Chinstrap penguins generally have shorter flippers compared to Gentoos)
||--- flipper length (mm) > 190
|||--- culmen depth (mm) <= 18.5
|||--- class: Gentoo (Gentoo penguins can be distinguished by their larger size and different beak shape/size)
|||--- culmen depth (mm) > 18.5
|||--- class: Adelie (Adelie penguins have a more slender beak compared to Gentoos but are smaller than Chinstraps)
```

**Important Considerations:**
1. **Actual Data**: The decision tree above is speculative and based on general knowledge about the physical characteristics of these penguin species and their habitats.
2. **Feature Importance**: In real-world scenarios, feature importance would be determined through analysis of variance (ANOVA) or other statistical methods to understand which features most significantly contribute to distinguishing between classes.
3. **Tree Complexity**: The decision tree provided is simplified for illustrative purposes. Real decision trees can be more complex and may include additional splits based on multiple features.

For a precise decision tree, one would typically use machine learning algorithms (like those in scikit-learn for Python) that analyze the actual dataset to determine the most informative features and construct an optimal tree based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Here is the Python function based on the provided decision tree:

```python
def predict_penguin_species(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the species of a penguin based on its features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the features of the penguin.
        - island (int): The island where the penguin was found (0 = Biscoe, 1 = Dream, 2 = Torgersen)
        - culmen_length_mm (float): The length of the penguin's culmen in mm
        - culmen_depth_mm (float): The depth of the penguin's culmen in mm
        - flipper_length_mm (float): The length of the penguin's flipper in mm
        - body_mass_g (float): The mass of the penguin in grams
        - sex (int): The sex of the penguin (0 = nan, 1 = female, 2 = male)
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the predicted species and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
        - prediction (int): The predicted species (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)
        - nodes (list): A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes
    """
    
    # Initialize the list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = [None] * 3
    
    # Check if the penguin is from Torgersen island
    nodes[0] = X["island"] == 2
    
    # If not, check the flipper length
    nodes[1] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 190
    
    # If the flipper length condition is met, check the culmen depth
    nodes[2] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 18.5
    
    # Predict the species based on the conditions
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 2  # Gentoo
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Adelie
    
    # Convert the boolean values to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X = {
    "island": 2,
    "culmen_length_mm": 40.0,
    "culmen_depth_mm": 20.0,
    "flipper_length_mm": 200.0,
    "body_mass_g": 5000.0,
    "sex": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict_penguin_species(X)
print(f"Predicted species: {prediction}")
print(f"Inner nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this function, the decision tree is implemented as follows:

- If the penguin is from Torgersen island (`island == 2`), it is predicted to be an Adelie.
- If not, and the flipper length is less than or equal to 190 mm, it is predicted to be a Chinstrap.
- If the flipper length condition is met but the culmen depth is greater than 18.5 mm, it is predicted to be an Adelie.

Note that this decision tree is based on hypothetical conditions and may not accurately reflect real-world data. The thresholds used in the conditions (e.g., `flipper_length_mm <= 190`, `culmen_depth_mm <= 18.5`) are arbitrary and should be adjusted according to actual data analysis.
