To build a decision tree classifier for the penguin species based on the given features, we first need to understand that the most important features for distinguishing between Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins are typically related to their physical characteristics and habitat. The features provided are: island, culmen length (mm), culmen depth (mm), flipper length (mm), body mass (g), and sex.

Given that we want a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, we will focus on the two most discriminatory features for the first and second splits. 

1. **First Split Feature**: The most distinctive feature among penguin species often relates to their physical measurements, which are closely linked to their evolution and adaptation to different environments. Among these, `culmen length` and `flipper length` are particularly noteworthy because they directly relate to feeding behaviors and swimming abilities, which can vary significantly between species.

2. **Second Split Feature**: After the first split, we need another feature that can further distinguish between the remaining classes. `Culmen depth` and `body mass` could be good candidates for this, as they provide additional information on the penguin's size and feeding behavior, which can help in distinguishing between species.

Given these considerations and aiming for a simple model with a maximum depth of 2, we might construct a decision tree as follows:

- **First Split**: Use `flipper length (mm)` as it is a key distinguishing feature among penguin species. For example:
  - Flipper length <= 190 mm could indicate Adelie or Chinstrap penguins.
  - Flipper length > 190 mm might lean more towards Gentoo penguins, given their generally larger size.

- **Second Split**: Within each branch of the first split, use `culmen depth (mm)` to further differentiate:
  - For flipper lengths <= 190 mm, a culmen depth <= 18.5 mm could indicate Adelie, and > 18.5 mm might suggest Chinstrap.
  - For flipper lengths > 190 mm, focusing on Gentoo, we might look at body mass or another feature for finer distinction, but given our constraints, `culmen depth` can still serve as a broad discriminator.

The resulting decision tree could look something like this:

```
|--- flipper length (mm) <= 190
||--- culmen depth (mm) <= 18.5
|||--- class: Adelie
||--- culmen depth (mm) > 18.5
|||--- class: Chinstrap
|--- flipper length (mm) > 190
||--- culmen depth (mm) <= 20
|||--- class: Gentoo
||--- culmen depth (mm) > 20
|||--- class: This could potentially be another species or require further features to accurately classify.
```

Please note, the exact thresholds used (`190 mm` for flipper length and `18.5 mm` for culmen depth) are hypothetical and based on a simplified understanding of penguin physiology. Real-world classification would require actual data analysis, including statistical methods to determine the optimal split points that maximize class separation.

This example provides a basic framework for how one might approach building a decision tree classifier for distinguishing between different species of penguins based on physical characteristics. However, real applications would necessitate detailed data analysis and potentially more complex trees or ensemble methods to achieve high accuracy.

Here's the Python function based on the provided decision tree:

```python
def predict_penguin_species(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the species of a penguin based on its characteristics.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the features of the penguin. The keys are:
        - 'island'
        - 'culmen_length_mm'
        - 'culmen_depth_mm'
        - 'flipper_length_mm'
        - 'body_mass_g'
        - 'sex'
    
    Returns:
    prediction (int): The predicted species of the penguin (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)
    nodes (list): A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes
    """
    
    # Initialize the nodes list with None values
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: flipper length <= 190 mm
    nodes[0] = X['flipper_length_mm'] <= 190
    
    # Second node: culmen depth <= 18.5 mm (only considered if first node is True)
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X['culmen_depth_mm'] <= 18.5
    else:
        # If the first node is False, we consider a different threshold for Gentoo penguins
        nodes[1] = X['culmen_depth_mm'] <= 20

    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:

This function uses the provided decision tree to predict the species of a penguin based on its characteristics. The `nodes` list represents the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree, where 1 indicates that the condition was satisfied and 0 indicates that it was not.
