To build a decision tree for classifying the species of penguins based on the given features, we will first identify the most important features that contribute to distinguishing between Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins. The provided features are:

1. island (Biscoe / Dream / Torgersen)
2. culmen length (mm)
3. culmen depth (mm)
4. flipper length (mm)
5. body mass (g)
6. sex (male / female)

Given the goal is to classify penguins into three species with a maximum decision tree depth of 2, we need to consider which features are most relevant for distinguishing between these species.

### Step 1: Feature Importance
Without actual data, it's challenging to determine feature importance directly through methods like permutation importance or SHAP values. However, based on biological and ecological knowledge:

- **Island**: Could be important as different species might have preferences for different habitats.
- **Culmen length** and **culmen depth**: These are morphological features that can vary significantly between species.
- **Flipper length**: Also a key distinguishing feature among penguin species, as it relates to their swimming abilities.
- **Body mass**: Can be indicative of the species, given that different species have distinct average weights.
- **Sex**: While important for understanding population dynamics, it might not directly contribute to species classification since males and females within a species share many characteristics.

### Step 2: Building the Decision Tree
Given the maximum depth constraint and assuming we prioritize morphological features (culmen length, culmen depth, flipper length) and body mass for their direct relevance to species differentiation, a simplified decision tree could look like this:

1. **Root Node**: Flipper Length (mm)
   - This is chosen because flipper length can significantly vary between Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins.
   
2. **Left Child of Root (Flipper Length <= Threshold)**:
   - Feature: Culmen Depth (mm)
     - If culmen depth is less than or equal to a certain threshold, classify as Adelie.
     - Else, classify as Chinstrap.

3. **Right Child of Root (Flipper Length > Threshold)**:
   - Feature: Body Mass (g)
     - If body mass is less than or equal to a certain threshold, classify as Gentoo.
     - Else, this could potentially lead to another level of distinction, but given the depth constraint, we might directly classify based on the flipper length threshold for simplicity.

### Example Decision Tree:

```
|--- flipper length (mm) <= 190
||--- culmen depth (mm) <= 18.5
|||--- class: Adelie
||--- culmen depth (mm) > 18.5
|||--- class: Chinstrap
|--- flipper length (mm) > 190
||--- body mass (g) <= 5500
|||--- class: Gentoo
||--- body mass (g) > 5500
|||--- Given the depth constraint, this could default to Gentoo or require additional features for further distinction.
```

**Note**: The thresholds used here are hypothetical and based on general knowledge. Actual data analysis would be required to determine the precise thresholds that best distinguish between species.

This decision tree provides a basic framework for classification but highlights the importance of selecting relevant features and understanding their implications in distinguishing between different penguin species.

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting penguin species based on their characteristics. The thresholds used are based on general knowledge and may need to be adjusted with actual data.

```python
def predict_penguin_species(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the penguin species (Adelie, Chinstrap, or Gentoo) based on its characteristics.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the features of the penguin.
        - island (int): The island where the penguin is found (0 = Biscoe, 1 = Dream, 2 = Torgersen)
        - culmen_length_mm (float): The length of the culmen in mm
        - culmen_depth_mm (float): The depth of the culmen in mm
        - flipper_length_mm (float): The length of the flipper in mm
        - body_mass_g (float): The body mass of the penguin in grams
        - sex (int): The sex of the penguin (0 = nan, 1 = female, 2 = male)
    
    Returns:
    prediction (int): The predicted species of the penguin (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)
    nodes (list): A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes
    """

    # Initialize the nodes with None
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Node 0: Check if flipper length is less than or equal to 190 mm
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 190

    # Node 1: If flipper length is less than or equal to 190 mm, check if culmen depth is less than or equal to 18.5 mm
    # Otherwise, check if body mass is less than or equal to 4500 grams
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 18.5
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["body_mass_g"] <= 4500

    # Make the prediction based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo
        else:
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo (default to Gentoo if body mass is more than 4500 grams)

    # Convert boolean values in nodes to integers
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
X = {
    "island": 0,
    "culmen_length_mm": 40.5,
    "culmen_depth_mm": 18.2,
    "flipper_length_mm": 185,
    "body_mass_g": 4200,
    "sex": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict_penguin_species(X)
print(f"Predicted species: {['Adelie', 'Chinstrap', 'Gentoo'][prediction]}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This function first checks if the flipper length is less than or equal to 190 mm. If it is, the function then checks if the culmen depth is less than or equal to 18.5 mm. Based on these conditions, the function predicts the species of the penguin as Adelie (0) or Chinstrap (1). If the flipper length is more than 190 mm, the function checks if the body mass is less than or equal to 4500 grams and defaults to Gentoo (2) for both cases. The function returns the predicted species and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
