To induce a decision tree classifier for the species of penguins based on the given features, we first need to understand the importance of each feature in distinguishing between Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins. Since the actual dataset is not provided, I'll guide you through a general approach using Python with scikit-learn library, assuming we have a dataset that includes these features and the species classification.

Let's assume our dataset looks something like this:

| island | culmen_length_mm | culmen_depth_mm | flipper_length_mm | body_mass_g | sex    | species      |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| Biscoe | 40               | 15              | 200               | 3500        | male    | Adelie       |
| Dream  | 35               | 18              | 190               | 3200        | female  | Chinstrap    |
| ...    | ...              | ...             | ...               | ...         | ...     | ...          |

First, we need to prepare our data. This involves encoding categorical variables (like `island`, `sex`, and `species`) into numerical representations that can be used by the decision tree algorithm.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Load your dataset into a DataFrame (assuming it's named 'penguins')
df = pd.read_csv('your_penguins_data.csv')

# Encode categorical variables
le = LabelEncoder()
df['island'] = le.fit_transform(df['island'])
df['sex'] = le.fit_transform(df['sex'])
df['species'] = le.fit_transform(df['species'])

# Define features (X) and target (y)
X = df[['island', 'culmen_length_mm', 'culmen_depth_mm', 'flipper_length_mm', 'body_mass_g', 'sex']]
y = df['species']

# Split dataset into training set and test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=1)

# Create Decision Tree classifier
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()

# Train the model
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# To visualize or print the decision tree, you might want to use a library like scikit-learn's tree plot
from sklearn.tree import plot_tree
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))
plot_tree(clf, filled=True, class_names=['Adelie', 'Chinstrap', 'Gentoo'], feature_names=X.columns)
plt.show()
```

This code snippet does the following:
- Loads a dataset.
- Encodes categorical variables into numerical formats.
- Splits the data into training and testing sets.
- Trains a decision tree classifier on the training set.
- Makes predictions on the test set and evaluates the model's performance.

The `plot_tree` function from scikit-learn is used to visualize the decision tree, which can help in understanding how different features are used at each split to classify penguins into their respective species. 

Note: The actual importance of features (like `culmen length`, `flipper length`, etc.) in distinguishing between penguin species might vary based on the dataset's specifics. This example provides a general framework for inducing and evaluating a decision tree classifier for this task.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting penguin species based on given features. This example uses thresholds derived from general knowledge about the physical characteristics of Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins.

```python
def predict_penguin_species(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the island is Biscoe (0) or not
    nodes[0] = X["island"] == 0
    
    # Node 1: Check if the culmen length is less than or equal to 35 mm
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 35
    
    # Node 2: Check if the flipper length is greater than 200 mm
    nodes[2] = X["flipper_length_mm"] > 200
    
    # Node 3: Check if the body mass is less than or equal to 4500 grams
    nodes[3] = X["body_mass_g"] <= 4500
    
    # Node 4: Check if the sex is male (2)
    nodes[4] = X["sex"] == 2

    if nodes[0]:  # Biscoe Island
        if nodes[1]:  # Short culmen length, likely Adelie
            prediction = 0
        else:
            if nodes[3]:  # Lower body mass, could be Adelie or Gentoo
                if nodes[2]:  # Longer flipper, more likely Gentoo
                    prediction = 2
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Otherwise, more likely Adelie
            else:  # Higher body mass and longer culmen, likely Gentoo
                prediction = 2
    else:  # Not Biscoe Island
        if nodes[4]:  # Male penguin
            if nodes[2]:  # Longer flipper length, more likely Gentoo
                prediction = 2
            else:
                if nodes[1]:  # Shorter culmen length, could be Chinstrap
                    prediction = 1
                else:  # Longer culmen and not on Biscoe, could be Adelie or Gentoo
                    prediction = 0
        else:  # Female penguin
            if nodes[3]:  # Lower body mass, more likely Adelie or Chinstrap
                if nodes[1]:  # Shorter culmen length, likely Chinstrap
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Otherwise, could be Adelie
            else:  # Higher body mass and not on Biscoe, likely Gentoo
                prediction = 2

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with keys corresponding to the feature names provided. It then applies a series of checks based on the values of these features to predict the species of the penguin. The thresholds used are based on general knowledge and may need adjustment depending on the specific dataset being used.

The function returns two values: 
1. `prediction`: An integer representing the predicted species (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo).
2. A list of boolean values converted to integers (`[int(node) for node in nodes]`), where each value corresponds to whether the condition at a particular node was met (1 if true, 0 if false).

Note: The thresholds and logic used in this decision tree are simplified examples based on general characteristics of penguin species. Real-world applications might require more sophisticated models and careful tuning of parameters based on actual data analysis.
