To build a decision tree for classifying penguin species based on the given features, we first need to understand that the actual classification would depend on analyzing real data. However, since you've provided an example and a set of features related to penguins, I'll simulate how one might construct such a tree using logical deductions about the importance of each feature in distinguishing between Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins.

Given Features:
- island (Biscoe / Dream / Torgersen)
- culmen length (mm)
- culmen depth (mm)
- flipper length (mm)
- body mass (g)
- sex (male / female)

Let's build a hypothetical decision tree based on these features. The structure of the tree will depend on which features are most discriminatory between species.

1. **Island**: This could be an important initial feature because different penguin species might have preferences for certain islands or habitats.
2. **Culmen Length and Depth**: These are physical characteristics that can vary significantly between species, potentially making them good discriminators.
3. **Flipper Length**: Like culmen dimensions, flipper length is a physical trait that could help distinguish between species due to differences in swimming styles and habits.
4. **Body Mass**: This could be useful for distinguishing between larger (e.g., Gentoo) and smaller penguins (e.g., Adelie).
5. **Sex**: While sex might influence some physical characteristics, it's less likely to be a strong classifier on its own for species distinction.

Given these considerations, here's a simplified decision tree:

- **Island == Torgersen**
  - Most likely: **Adelie** (Torgersen Island is known to have a significant Adelie population)
- **Island != Torgersen**
  - **Flipper Length <= 190 mm**
    - Most likely: **Chinstrap** (Chinstraps tend to have shorter flippers than Gentoos and can be found on Dream and Biscoe islands)
  - **Flipper Length > 190 mm**
    - **Body Mass >= 4500 g**
      - Most likely: **Gentoo** (Gentoos are larger, so higher body mass and longer flipper length could indicate Gentoo)
    - **Body Mass < 4500 g**
      - Consider **culmen depth**:
        - **Culmen Depth <= 18 mm**: Could be either Adelie or Chinstrap; further analysis needed.
        - **Culmen Depth > 18 mm**: Potentially more likely to be **Gentoo**, given the larger culmen size.

This tree is highly speculative and based on general knowledge about these penguin species. Real-world classification would require actual data analysis (e.g., using machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forests) to determine which features are most predictive of species identity.

Here's a simplified representation in a decision tree format similar to your example:

```
|--- island == Torgersen
||--- class: Adelie
|--- island != Torgersen
||--- flipper length <= 190 mm
|||--- class: Chinstrap
||--- flipper length > 190 mm
|||--- body mass >= 4500 g
||||--- class: Gentoo
|||--- body mass < 4500 g
||||--- culmen depth <= 18 mm
|||||--- Further analysis needed (Adelie/Chinstrap)
||||--- culmen depth > 18 mm
|||||--- class: Gentoo
```

Here's a Python function that takes in the features as a dictionary and returns a prediction of the penguin species along with the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict_penguin_species(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the species of a penguin based on its characteristics.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the features 'island', 'culmen_length_mm', 
              'culmen_depth_mm', 'flipper_length_mm', 'body_mass_g', and 'sex'.
    
    Returns:
    prediction (int): The predicted species of the penguin (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo).
    nodes (list): A list of truth values representing the conditions at each inner node.
    """
    # Initialize nodes with None
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Check if the island is Torgersen
    nodes[0] = X["island"] == 2
    
    # Check flipper length for non-Torgersen islands
    nodes[1] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 190
    
    # Check body mass for longer flippers on non-Torgersen islands
    nodes[2] = X["body_mass_g"] >= 4500
    
    # Check culmen depth when body mass is less than 4500g and flipper length > 190mm
    nodes[3] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 18
    
    # Check island for non-Torgersen and flipper length > 190mm, body mass < 4500g, culmen depth > 18mm
    nodes[4] = X["island"] == 1
    
    # Convert boolean values to integers (1 if True, 0 if False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    # Make predictions based on the conditions at each inner node
    if nodes[0]:  # If island is Torgersen
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # Flipper length <= 190mm
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # Body mass >= 4500g
                prediction = 2  # Gentoo
            else:
                if not nodes[3]:  # Culmen depth > 18mm
                    prediction = 2  # Gentoo
                elif nodes[4]:  # If island is Dream and other conditions are met
                    prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Adelie
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
features = {
    "island": 2,
    "culmen_length_mm": 40,
    "culmen_depth_mm": 20,
    "flipper_length_mm": 200,
    "body_mass_g": 4000,
    "sex": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict_penguin_species(features)
print(f"Predicted species: {['Adelie', 'Chinstrap', 'Gentoo'][prediction]}")
print("Nodes:", nodes)

```

This code first initializes the inner nodes based on the conditions specified in the decision tree. It then uses these conditions to make a prediction about the penguin's species and returns this prediction along with the truth values of the inner nodes.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input dictionary `X` contains all the necessary features. You may want to add error checking code to handle cases where some features are missing or have invalid values.
