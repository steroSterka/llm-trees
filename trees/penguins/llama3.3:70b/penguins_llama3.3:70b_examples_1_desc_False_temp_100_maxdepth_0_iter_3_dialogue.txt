To build a decision tree for classifying penguin species based on the given features, we'll follow a similar structure to your example. Since you haven't provided specific data points or thresholds, I'll simulate how one might approach this using hypothetical thresholds derived from analyzing the features' importance and their distribution among the Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins.

Let's assume after analyzing the dataset:
- **Island** is a crucial feature because different species of penguins tend to inhabit different islands.
- **Culmen length (mm)** and **culmen depth (mm)** are important for distinguishing between species as these physical characteristics can vary significantly among them.
- **Flipper length (mm)** and **body mass (g)** can also be discriminative, especially when combined with other features.
- **Sex** might not be as directly influential in species classification since it's a characteristic within each species rather than between them.

Given this, here is a hypothetical decision tree:

1. **Island**
   - If the penguin is from **Torgersen**, it is likely an **Adelie** because Adelie penguins are known to inhabit Torgersen Island.
   - If the penguin is from **Biscoe** or **Dream**, proceed to the next step.

2. **Culmen length (mm)**
   - If **culmen length <= 35 mm**, it could be a **Chinstrap** because Chinstrap penguins tend to have shorter culmens.
   - If **culmen length > 35 mm**, proceed to the next step.

3. **Flipper length (mm)**
   - If **flipper length <= 190 mm**, considering the previous steps, it might lean towards being a **Gentoo** because Gentoo penguins have relatively shorter flippers compared to their body size.
   - If **flipper length > 190 mm**, and given the culmen length is longer, it could also be an **Adelie**, especially if other features align (like body mass and sex).

4. **Body mass (g)**
   - For penguins not clearly classified by island or culmen length, **body mass** can help differentiate. For example:
     - A lower **body mass** might indicate a **Chinstrap**.
     - A higher **body mass** could suggest either an **Adelie** or **Gentoo**, depending on the other features.

5. **Sex**
   - While not a primary classifier, if all else is equal, and there's a need for further differentiation, the sex might influence the final classification marginally, based on how males and females of each species differ in the measured characteristics.

Decision Tree:
```
|--- island == Torgersen
||--- class: Adelie
|--- island != Torgersen
||--- culmen length (mm) <= 35
|||--- class: Chinstrap
||--- culmen length (mm) > 35
|||--- flipper length (mm) <= 190
||||--- class: Gentoo
|||--- flipper length (mm) > 190
||||--- body mass (g) < 4000
|||||--- class: Adelie
||||--- body mass (g) >= 4000
|||||--- class: Gentoo
```

This tree is a simplified example and real-world classification would require actual data analysis to determine the most discriminative features and their thresholds. The decision points (e.g., `culmen length <= 35 mm`, `flipper length > 190 mm`) are hypothetical and chosen for illustrative purposes. In practice, these would be derived from statistical analysis or machine learning algorithms applied to a dataset of penguin characteristics.

Here's the Python function based on the decision tree we constructed earlier. This function takes a dictionary `X` representing a penguin with its features and returns a tuple containing the predicted species (as an integer) and a list of boolean values indicating whether each inner node condition was satisfied.

```python
def predict_penguin_species(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Check if the penguin is from Torgersen island
    nodes[0] = X["island"] == 2
    
    # Check culmen length to differentiate between species
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 35
    
    # Differentiate based on flipper length for larger culmen lengths
    nodes[2] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 190
    
    # Consider body mass for further differentiation
    nodes[3] = X["body_mass_g"] < 4000
    
    # Sex is not a primary classifier but could influence in some cases
    nodes[4] = X["sex"] == 2  # Male
    
    prediction = None
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Torgersen island, likely Adelie
        prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # Short culmen length, likely Chinstrap
            prediction = 1
        else:  # Longer culmen length
            if nodes[2]:  # Shorter flipper length, could be Gentoo or Adelie
                if nodes[3]:  # Lower body mass, more likely Adelie
                    prediction = 0
                else:
                    prediction = 2  # Higher body mass, likely Gentoo
            else:  # Longer flipper length, likely Adelie but consider sex and other factors
                if nodes[4] and X["culmen_depth_mm"] > 18:  # Male with deeper culmen, could be Adelie
                    prediction = 0
                else:
                    prediction = 2  # Otherwise, more likely Gentoo
    
    # Convert boolean nodes to integers for output
    node_values = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, node_values

# Example usage:
penguin_features = {
    "island": 2,
    "culmen_length_mm": 40,
    "culmen_depth_mm": 20,
    "flipper_length_mm": 200,
    "body_mass_g": 4500,
    "sex": 2
}

predicted_species, node_values = predict_penguin_species(penguin_features)
print(f"Predicted species: {predicted_species}")
print(f"Node values: {node_values}")
```

This function uses the features provided to make a prediction about the penguin's species based on our constructed decision tree. The example usage demonstrates how to call this function with a dictionary representing a penguin and print out both the predicted species and the node values indicating which conditions were met during the prediction process.
