Based on the features you provided, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict whether an application for credit is accepted or not. Here's the decision tree:

|--- income per dependent <= 3.5
||--- owning a home == yes
|||--- monthly credit card expenses <= 500
||||--- class: Accepted
|||--- monthly credit card expenses > 500
||||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
|||||--- class: Accepted
|||||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
|||||--- class: Rejected
||--- owning a home == no
|||--- age >= 35
||||--- self employed == no
|||||--- class: Accepted
|||||--- self employed == yes
|||||--- class: Rejected
|||--- age < 35
||||--- income per dependent <= 2.5
|||||--- class: Rejected
||||--- income per dependent > 2.5
|||||--- class: Accepted
|--- income per dependent > 3.5
||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
|||--- class: Accepted
||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
|||--- self employed == no
||||--- age >= 40
|||||--- class: Accepted
||||--- age < 40
|||||--- class: Rejected
|||--- self employed == yes
||||--- class: Rejected

This decision tree uses the following features in order of importance:

1. Income per dependent
2. Owning a home
3. Monthly credit card expenses
4. Number of derogatory reports
5. Age
6. Self-employed status

Note that this is just one possible decision tree, and different algorithms or techniques may produce different trees. Additionally, the performance of this tree on unseen data may vary depending on the underlying relationships between the features and the target variable.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    nodes[2] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 500
    nodes[3] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[4] = X["Age"] >= 35
    nodes[5] = X["Self.employed"] == 0
    nodes[6] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 2.5

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                if nodes[5]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
            else:
                if nodes[6]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if X["Self.employed"] == 0:
                if X["Age"] >= 40:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 0

    # Convert boolean values to integers (1 or 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where each key corresponds to a feature and the value is the corresponding feature value. The function returns a tuple containing the predicted class label (`prediction`) and a list of integers representing the truth values of the inner nodes (`nodes`).
