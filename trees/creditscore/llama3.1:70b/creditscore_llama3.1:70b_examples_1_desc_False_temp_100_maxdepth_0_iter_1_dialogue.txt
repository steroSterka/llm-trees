Based on the provided features, I will build a decision tree classifier to predict whether an application for credit is accepted or not. Here's the induced decision tree:

|--- income per dependent <= 3
||--- class: rejected (high dependency ratio may indicate financial strain)
|--- income per dependent > 3
||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
|||--- owning a home == yes
||||--- class: accepted (stable income, low debt, and homeownership indicate creditworthiness)
|||--- owning a home == no
||||--- monthly credit card expenses <= $500
|||||--- class: accepted (stable income, manageable debt, and low credit utilization)
|||||--- monthly credit card expenses > $500
|||||--- self employed == no
||||||--- class: rejected (high credit utilization may indicate financial instability)
||||||--- self employed == yes
||||||--- age >= 35
|||||||--- class: accepted (self-employment, stable income, and manageable debt)
|||||||--- age < 35
|||||||--- class: rejected (high credit utilization, self-employment, and limited financial history)

The decision tree uses the following features in order of importance:

1. Income per dependent
2. Number of derogatory reports
3. Owning a home
4. Monthly credit card expenses
5. Self employed
6. Age

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: income per dependent <= 3
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3
    
    # Node 2: number of derogatory reports <= 1
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    
    # Node 3: owning a home == yes
    nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    
    # Node 4: monthly credit card expenses <= $500
    nodes[3] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 500
    
    # Node 5: self employed == no
    nodes[4] = X["Self.employed"] == 0
    
    # Node 6: age >= 35
    nodes[5] = X["Age"] >= 35
    
    if not nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # rejected (high dependency ratio)
    elif nodes[1]:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # accepted (stable income, low debt, homeownership)
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # accepted (stable income, manageable debt)
            else:
                if not nodes[4]:
                    if nodes[5]:
                        prediction = 1  # accepted (self-employment, stable income, age)
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # rejected (high credit utilization, self-employment, young age)
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # rejected (high credit utilization)
    else:
        prediction = 0
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values. It returns a tuple containing the predicted class label (either 0 or 1) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.

Note that I've used the same encoding for the target variable as specified in the problem statement, where 0 represents "rejected" and 1 represents "accepted".
