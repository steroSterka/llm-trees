Based on the features you provided, I'll build a decision tree classifier using the most important features. Here's my attempt:

|--- income per dependent <= 3
||--- owning a home = yes
|||--- monthly credit card expenses <= $200
||||--- class: accepted
|||--- monthly credit card expenses > $200
||||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
|||||--- class: accepted
||||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
|||||--- class: rejected
||--- owning a home = no
|||--- age >= 30
||||--- self employed = no
|||||--- income per dependent > 2
||||||--- class: accepted
|||||--- income per dependent <= 2
||||||--- class: rejected
||||--- self employed = yes
|||||--- monthly credit card expenses <= $100
||||||--- class: accepted
|||||--- monthly credit card expenses > $100
||||||--- class: rejected
|--- income per dependent > 3
||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
|||--- age >= 25
||||--- self employed = no
|||||--- class: accepted
||||--- self employed = yes
|||||--- monthly credit card expenses <= $150
||||||--- class: accepted
|||||--- monthly credit card expenses > $150
||||||--- class: rejected
||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
|||--- class: rejected

Here's my reasoning:

* I started with `income per dependent` as the first feature, since it seems to be a strong indicator of financial stability.
* For those with low income per dependent (<= 3), owning a home is an important factor. If they own a home, their creditworthiness is likely higher, and we can accept them if their monthly credit card expenses are reasonable.
* For non-homeowners with low income per dependent, age becomes a more important factor. Older individuals (>= 30) without a high income per dependent may still be accepted if they have a stable job (not self-employed).
* For those with higher income per dependent (> 3), the number of derogatory reports is a critical factor. If there are few or no derogatory reports, age becomes less important, and we can focus on other factors like monthly credit card expenses.
* Self-employment status also plays a role in certain cases, as it may indicate more financial risk.

Keep in mind that this decision tree is just one possible interpretation of the features you provided. In practice, you might want to use techniques like feature engineering, cross-validation, and model evaluation to refine your tree and improve its performance on unseen data.
=======
Based on the features you provided, I'll build a decision tree classifier using the most important features to predict whether an application for credit is accepted or not. Here's my attempt:

|--- owning a home == yes
||--- income per dependent > 4.5
|||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
||||--- class: Accepted
|||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
||||--- class: Rejected
||--- income per dependent <= 4.5
|||--- monthly credit card expenses <= $500
||||--- class: Accepted
||||--- monthly credit card expenses > $500
||||--- class: Rejected
|--- owning a home == no
||--- age > 35
|||--- self employed == no
||||--- class: Accepted
||||--- self employed == yes
||||--- class: Rejected
||--- age <= 35
|||--- income per dependent > 3.5
||||--- class: Accepted
||||--- income per dependent <= 3.5
||||--- class: Rejected

Here's my thought process:

* Owning a home seems like a strong indicator of creditworthiness, so I started with that.
* For those who own a home, I considered income per dependent as the next most important feature. A higher income per dependent suggests more financial stability.
* Within this branch, I looked at the number of derogatory reports. If there's only one or none, it's likely the application will be accepted.
* For non-homeowners, age seemed like a reasonable next feature to consider. Older individuals may have a longer credit history and be considered less risky.
* For younger non-homeowners, self-employment status became an important factor. Self-employed individuals may face more financial uncertainty.
* Finally, income per dependent was used again as a secondary consideration within some of these branches.

Please note that this is just one possible decision tree, and the actual performance of the model will depend on the specific data you're working with.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 9 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Income per dependent <= 3
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Owning a home (yes/no)
        nodes[1] = X["Own.home"] == 1
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Monthly credit card expenses <= $200
            nodes[2] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 200
            
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                # Node 3: Number of derogatory reports <= 1
                nodes[3] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
                
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
        else:
            # Node 4: Age >= 30
            nodes[4] = X["Age"] >= 30
            
            if nodes[4]:
                # Node 5: Self employed (yes/no)
                nodes[5] = X["Self.employed"] == 1
                
                if nodes[5]:
                    # Node 6: Monthly credit card expenses <= $100
                    nodes[6] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 100
                    
                    if nodes[6]:
                        prediction = 1
                    else:
                        prediction = 0
                else:
                    # Node 7: Income per dependent > 2
                    nodes[7] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 2
                    
                    if nodes[7]:
                        prediction = 1
                    else:
                        prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:
        # Node 8: Number of derogatory reports <= 1
        nodes[8] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
        
        if nodes[8]:
            # Node 9: Age >= 25 (not used)
            # ...
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    
    return prediction, nodes
```
Note that I had to make some assumptions about the thresholds for certain features, as they were not provided. Also, I didn't implement Node 9 as it was not clear what the condition should be.
=======
Here is the decision tree as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 4.5
    nodes[2] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[3] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 500
    nodes[4] = X["Age"] > 35
    nodes[5] = X["Self.employed"] == 0
    nodes[6] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 3.5

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1 if nodes[2] else 0
        else:
            prediction = 1 if nodes[3] else 0
    else:
        if nodes[4]:
            prediction = 1 if nodes[5] else 0
        elif nodes[6]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    # Convert boolean values to integers (1 or 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values. It returns a tuple containing the predicted class label (`prediction`) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes (`nodes`). The `nodes` list is converted to integers (1 or 0) before being returned.

You can use this function like this:
```python
X = {"Age": 30, "Income.per.dependent": 5.0, "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 200,
     "Own.home": 1, "Self.employed": 0, "Derogatory.reports": 0}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(prediction)  # prints the predicted class label
print(nodes)  # prints the list of boolean values representing the inner nodes
```
