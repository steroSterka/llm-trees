Based on the provided features, I will build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 to classify whether an application for credit is accepted or not. Here's the decision tree:

|--- income per dependent <= 4
||--- class: rejected (high dependency ratio)
|--- income per dependent > 4
||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
|||--- class: accepted
||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
|||--- class: rejected (multiple derogatory reports)

I selected the most important features by considering the following:

* Income per dependent is a strong indicator of creditworthiness, as it reflects the applicant's ability to support themselves and their dependents.
* Number of derogatory reports is another critical feature, as multiple negative marks on an individual's credit history can indicate a higher risk for lenders.

The decision tree works as follows:

1. If the income per dependent is low (<= 4), the application is rejected due to concerns about the applicant's financial stability.
2. If the income per dependent is moderate to high (> 4), we examine the number of derogatory reports:
	* If there is one or no derogatory report, the application is accepted.
	* If there are multiple derogatory reports, the application is rejected due to concerns about the applicant's credit history.

Please note that this decision tree is a simplified example and may not reflect real-world complexities. Additional features, such as credit score, debt-to-income ratio, or employment history, might be necessary for a more accurate model.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4.5
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

In this function, I used the following thresholds:

* `Income.per.dependent` <= 4.5: This threshold is chosen to separate individuals with lower income per dependent from those with higher income per dependent.
* `Derogatory.reports` <= 1: This threshold is chosen to identify individuals with one or no derogatory reports, who are considered less risky.

The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys match the feature names provided. The function returns a tuple containing the predicted class label (0 = application rejected, 1 = application accepted) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Note that this decision tree is a simplified example and may not reflect real-world complexities. Additional features or more sophisticated models might be necessary for a more accurate prediction.
