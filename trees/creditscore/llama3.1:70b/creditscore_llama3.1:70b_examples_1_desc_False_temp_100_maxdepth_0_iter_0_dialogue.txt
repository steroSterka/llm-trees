Based on the features you provided, I'll build a decision tree classifier to predict whether an application for credit is accepted or not. Here's the tree:

|--- income per dependent <= 3
||--- owning a home == yes
|||--- monthly credit card expenses <= 500
||||--- class: Accepted
|||--- monthly credit card expenses > 500
||||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
|||||--- class: Accepted
|||||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
|||||--- class: Rejected
||--- owning a home == no
|||--- age >= 30
||||--- income per dependent <= 2.5
|||||--- class: Rejected
|||||--- income per dependent > 2.5
|||||--- self employed == no
||||||--- class: Accepted
||||||--- self employed == yes
||||||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
|||||||--- class: Accepted
|||||||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
|||||||--- class: Rejected
|||--- age < 30
||||--- income per dependent <= 2.5
|||||--- class: Rejected
|||||--- income per dependent > 2.5
|||||--- self employed == no
||||||--- class: Accepted
||||||--- self employed == yes
||||||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
|||||||--- class: Accepted
|||||||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
|||||||--- class: Rejected
|--- income per dependent > 3
||--- monthly credit card expenses <= 1000
|||--- age >= 30
||||--- owning a home == yes
|||||--- class: Accepted
|||||--- owning a home == no
|||||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
||||||--- class: Accepted
||||||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
||||||--- self employed == no
|||||||--- class: Accepted
|||||||--- self employed == yes
|||||||--- class: Rejected
|||--- age < 30
||||--- owning a home == yes
|||||--- class: Accepted
|||||--- owning a home == no
|||||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
||||||--- class: Accepted
||||||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
||||||--- self employed == no
|||||||--- class: Rejected
|||||||--- self employed == yes
|||||||--- class: Rejected
||--- monthly credit card expenses > 1000
|||--- age >= 30
||||--- owning a home == yes
|||||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
||||||--- class: Accepted
||||||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
||||||--- self employed == no
|||||||--- class: Rejected
|||||||--- self employed == yes
|||||||--- class: Rejected
|||--- age < 30
||||--- owning a home == yes
|||||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
||||||--- class: Accepted
||||||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
||||||--- self employed == no
|||||||--- class: Rejected
|||||||--- self employed == yes
|||||||--- class: Rejected

This decision tree uses the most important features to classify whether an application for credit is accepted or not. The features used in the tree are:

1. income per dependent (most important feature)
2. owning a home
3. monthly credit card expenses
4. age
5. number of derogatory reports
6. self employed

Note that this tree may not be perfect and can be further optimized by tuning parameters or using more advanced techniques like pruning or ensemble methods.
=======
Based on the features you provided, I will build a decision tree using the most important features. Here is the result:

|--- income per dependent <= 3
||--- class: Rejected
|--- income per dependent > 3
||--- owning a home == yes
|||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
||||--- class: Accepted
|||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
||||--- self employed == no
|||||--- class: Accepted
|||||--- self employed == yes
|||||--- class: Rejected
||--- owning a home == no
|||--- monthly credit card expenses <= $500
||||--- age >= 25
|||||--- class: Accepted
|||||--- age < 25
|||||--- class: Rejected
|||--- monthly credit card expenses > $500
||||--- class: Rejected

Here's a brief explanation of the tree:

* The first split is based on income per dependent, which seems to be an important factor in determining creditworthiness.
* If the applicant has low income per dependent (<= 3), the application is rejected.
* If the applicant has higher income per dependent (> 3), the next split is based on whether they own a home. Owning a home may indicate financial stability.
* If the applicant owns a home, the next split is based on the number of derogatory reports. A low number of derogatory reports (<= 1) suggests good credit history, and the application is accepted.
* If the applicant does not own a home, the next split is based on monthly credit card expenses. Low expenses (<= $500) may indicate responsible spending habits. Within this group, older applicants (>= 25) are more likely to be accepted.

Please note that this decision tree is just an example and may not reflect real-world relationships between these features and creditworthiness.

This function uses the features you provided to predict whether an application for credit is accepted or not. The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree. Note that some thresholds were chosen arbitrarily and may need to be adjusted based on the specific dataset being used.
=======
Here is the Python function that represents the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    nodes[2] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[3] = X["Self.employed"] == 0
    nodes[4] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 500
    nodes[5] = X["Age"] >= 25

    if not nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0
    elif not nodes[1]:
        if nodes[4]:
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1
        elif nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return int(prediction), [int(x) for x in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the features as keys and returns a tuple containing the predicted class (0 or 1) and a list of truth values representing the inner nodes of the decision tree. The truth values are 1 if the condition is satisfied and 0 otherwise.

Note that I used the threshold values from your description to fill in the placeholders in the decision tree. Also, I assumed that the target variable encoding is 0 = no (rejected) and 1 = yes (accepted).
