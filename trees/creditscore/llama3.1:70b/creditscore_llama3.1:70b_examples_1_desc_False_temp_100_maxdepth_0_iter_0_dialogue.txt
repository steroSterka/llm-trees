Based on the features you provided, I will build a decision tree using the most important features. Here is the result:

|--- income per dependent <= 3
||--- class: Rejected
|--- income per dependent > 3
||--- owning a home == yes
|||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
||||--- class: Accepted
|||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
||||--- self employed == no
|||||--- class: Accepted
|||||--- self employed == yes
|||||--- class: Rejected
||--- owning a home == no
|||--- monthly credit card expenses <= $500
||||--- age >= 25
|||||--- class: Accepted
|||||--- age < 25
|||||--- class: Rejected
|||--- monthly credit card expenses > $500
||||--- class: Rejected

Here's a brief explanation of the tree:

* The first split is based on income per dependent, which seems to be an important factor in determining creditworthiness.
* If the applicant has low income per dependent (<= 3), the application is rejected.
* If the applicant has higher income per dependent (> 3), the next split is based on whether they own a home. Owning a home may indicate financial stability.
* If the applicant owns a home, the next split is based on the number of derogatory reports. A low number of derogatory reports (<= 1) suggests good credit history, and the application is accepted.
* If the applicant does not own a home, the next split is based on monthly credit card expenses. Low expenses (<= $500) may indicate responsible spending habits. Within this group, older applicants (>= 25) are more likely to be accepted.

Please note that this decision tree is just an example and may not reflect real-world relationships between these features and creditworthiness.

Here is the Python function that represents the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    nodes[2] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[3] = X["Self.employed"] == 0
    nodes[4] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 500
    nodes[5] = X["Age"] >= 25

    if not nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0
    elif not nodes[1]:
        if nodes[4]:
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1
        elif nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return int(prediction), [int(x) for x in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the features as keys and returns a tuple containing the predicted class (0 or 1) and a list of truth values representing the inner nodes of the decision tree. The truth values are 1 if the condition is satisfied and 0 otherwise.

Note that I used the threshold values from your description to fill in the placeholders in the decision tree. Also, I assumed that the target variable encoding is 0 = no (rejected) and 1 = yes (accepted).
