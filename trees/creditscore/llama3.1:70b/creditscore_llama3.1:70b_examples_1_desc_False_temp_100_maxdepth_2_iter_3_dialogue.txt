Based on the features you provided, I will build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 to classify whether an application for credit is accepted or not.

Here is the decision tree:

|--- income per dependent <= 3.5
||--- owning a home == yes
|||--- class: accepted
||--- owning a home == no
|||--- class: rejected

|--- income per dependent > 3.5
||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
|||--- class: accepted
||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
|||--- class: rejected

The features used in this decision tree are:

* Income per dependent (most important feature)
* Owning a home (secondary feature for low-income individuals)
* Number of derogatory reports (secondary feature for high-income individuals)

Note that self-employed and monthly credit card expenses were not selected as primary or secondary features, but they could be considered in further iterations or with additional data. Also, age was not used as it might be less relevant compared to income per dependent.

Please note that this is a simplified decision tree based on the provided features and does not take into account other potential factors that may influence credit approval decisions.

Here is the Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes for the given decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 5.5
    nodes[1] = (X["Own.home"] == 1) if nodes[0] else (X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1)

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return int(prediction), [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function uses the decision tree defined earlier, with thresholds filled in for `Income.per.dependent` and `Derogatory.reports`. The `Own.home` feature is used as a secondary feature when `Income.per.dependent` is low. Note that this implementation assumes that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required features.

Also note that I've replaced the boolean values in the `nodes` list with integers (0 or 1) to match the format specified in your example. The prediction is also converted to an integer using `int(prediction)` before being returned.
