Based on the features you provided, I'll build a decision tree classifier using the most important features to classify whether an application for credit is accepted or not. Here's the result:


|--- income per dependent <= 4.5
||--- age > 35
|||--- owning a home = yes
||||--- class: Accepted
|||--- owning a home = no
||||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
|||||--- class: Accepted
||||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
|||||--- class: Rejected
||--- age <= 35
|||--- monthly credit card expenses <= $500
||||--- self employed = no
|||||--- class: Accepted
||||--- self employed = yes
|||||--- class: Rejected
|||--- monthly credit card expenses > $500
||||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
|||||--- class: Accepted
||||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
|||||--- class: Rejected
|--- income per dependent > 4.5
||--- self employed = no
|||--- owning a home = yes
||||--- class: Accepted
|||--- owning a home = no
||||--- age > 35
|||||--- class: Accepted
||||--- age <= 35
|||||--- class: Rejected
||--- self employed = yes
|||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
||||--- monthly credit card expenses <= $1000
|||||--- class: Accepted
||||--- monthly credit card expenses > $1000
|||||--- class: Rejected
|||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
||||--- class: Rejected

This decision tree uses the following features in order of importance:

1. income per dependent
2. age
3. owning a home
4. number of derogatory reports
5. self employed
6. monthly credit card expenses

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Income per dependent <= 4.5
    nodes[0] = X['Income.per.dependent'] <= 4.5
    
    # Node 1: Age > 35
    nodes[1] = X['Age'] > 35
    
    # Node 2: Owning a home = yes (1)
    nodes[2] = X['Own.home'] == 1
    
    # Node 3: Number of derogatory reports <= 1
    nodes[3] = X['Derogatory.reports'] <= 1
    
    # Node 4: Monthly credit card expenses <= $500
    nodes[4] = X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] <= 500
    
    # Node 5: Self employed = no (0)
    nodes[5] = X['Self.employed'] == 0
    
    # Node 6: Number of derogatory reports <= 1 (again for different branch)
    nodes[6] = X['Derogatory.reports'] <= 1

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                if nodes[5]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
            else:
                if nodes[6]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[5]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                if nodes[1]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
        else:
            if nodes[6]:
                if nodes[4] <= 1000:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 0
                
    return int(prediction), [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

Note that I've used the feature names and encodings exactly as provided. Also, I've assumed that the target variable `target` has values 0 (no) and 1 (yes). If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the prediction logic accordingly.
