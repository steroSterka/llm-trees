Based on the features you provided, I will induce a decision tree classifier to determine whether an application for credit is accepted or not. Here's the decision tree:

|--- income per dependent <= 4
||--- owning a home == yes
|||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
||||--- class: Accepted
|||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
||||--- class: Rejected
||--- owning a home == no
|||--- age >= 30
||||--- monthly credit card expenses <= $1000
|||||--- class: Accepted
||||--- monthly credit card expenses > $1000
|||||--- class: Rejected
|||--- age < 30
||||--- self employed == yes
|||||--- class: Rejected
||||--- self employed == no
|||||--- class: Accepted
|--- income per dependent > 4
||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
|||--- class: Accepted
||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
|||--- class: Rejected

This decision tree uses the following features in order of importance:

1. Income per dependent
2. Owning a home
3. Number of derogatory reports
4. Age
5. Monthly credit card expenses
6. Self employed

Note that this is just one possible decision tree, and different algorithms or techniques may produce different results.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4.5
    nodes[1] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    nodes[2] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[3] = X["Age"] >= 30
    nodes[4] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 1000
    nodes[5] = X["Self.employed"] == 1

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
            else:
                if nodes[5]:
                    prediction = 0
                else:
                    prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

Note that I used the `int()` function to convert the boolean values of the nodes to integers (0 or 1), as required by the problem statement. Also, I assumed that the threshold values are reasonable based on the feature ranges provided. If you need to adjust these thresholds, please let me know!
