I'll build the decision tree using the features you provided. Here's the result:

|--- income per dependent <= 3.5
||--- class: rejected
|--- income per dependent > 3.5
||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
|||--- class: accepted
||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
|||--- owning a home == yes
||||--- class: accepted
||||--- owning a home == no
|||||--- class: rejected

Here's how I made the decisions:

* First, I selected `income per dependent` as the root node feature because it seems to be an important factor in determining creditworthiness. A higher income per dependent indicates a lower debt-to-income ratio, which is generally favorable for credit applications.
* For the left child of the root node (income per dependent <= 3.5), I classified the application as `rejected` because this indicates a high debt burden and potentially unstable financial situation.
* For the right child of the root node (income per dependent > 3.5), I selected `number of derogatory reports` as the next feature to split on. This is because derogatory reports can significantly impact credit scores and indicate a higher risk for lenders.
* If there are no or only one derogatory report, I classified the application as `accepted`, assuming that the applicant's financial situation is relatively stable despite some minor issues.
* If there are more than one derogatory report, I selected `owning a home` as the next feature to split on. This is because owning a home can indicate stability and responsibility, which may offset the negative impact of multiple derogatory reports.
* For applicants who own a home with multiple derogatory reports, I classified the application as `accepted`. Otherwise, I classified it as `rejected`.

Please note that this decision tree has a maximum depth of 2, but you may want to consider using additional features or increasing the depth of the tree for better accuracy.

Here is the Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes for your decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
    if not nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 1
    else:
        nodes[1] = False
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if X["Own.home"] == 1:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function first checks the `Income.per.dependent` feature. If it's less than or equal to 3.5, the application is rejected (i.e., the target variable is 0). Otherwise, it checks if there are more than one derogatory reports (`Derogatory.reports` > 1). If so and the applicant owns a home, the application is accepted; otherwise, it's rejected.

Please note that this decision tree has been constructed based on the information provided in your prompt. However, you may need to fine-tune or adjust the thresholds (e.g., `Income.per.dependent` <= 3.5) for better accuracy based on your actual dataset.
