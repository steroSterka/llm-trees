Based on the provided features, I'll build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 to classify whether an application for credit is accepted or not. Here's the induced decision tree:

|--- owning a home == yes
||--- income per dependent > 3.5
|||--- class: Accepted
||--- income per dependent <= 3.5
|||--- class: Rejected
|--- owning a home == no
||--- number of derogatory reports < 2
|||--- class: Accepted
||--- number of derogatory reports >= 2
|||--- class: Rejected

Here's the explanation:

1. The most important feature is "owning a home" (yes/no), which splits the data into two main branches.
	* If the applicant owns a home, it indicates stability and responsibility, which increases the chances of acceptance.
	* If the applicant does not own a home, other factors become more crucial in determining creditworthiness.
2. For applicants who own a home (left branch), the next most important feature is "income per dependent". A higher income per dependent (> 3.5) suggests that the applicant has sufficient financial resources to manage debt, leading to an acceptance decision.
3. For applicants who do not own a home (right branch), the next most important feature is "number of derogatory reports". Fewer than two derogatory reports (< 2) indicate a relatively clean credit history, making it more likely for the application to be accepted.

Note that this is just one possible decision tree based on the provided features. Other trees might also perform well, depending on the specific dataset and target variable distribution.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 3.5
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] < 2

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = int(nodes[1])
    else:
        prediction = int(nodes[1])

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values. The function returns a tuple containing the predicted value (0 or 1) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

Note that I used `int(nodes[1])` to convert the boolean values to integers (0 or 1), as required by the problem statement. Also, I assumed that the threshold for "Derogatory.reports" is less than 2, based on the decision tree structure.
