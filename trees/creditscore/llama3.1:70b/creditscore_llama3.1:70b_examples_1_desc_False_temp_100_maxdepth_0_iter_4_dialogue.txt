Based on the features you provided, I will build a decision tree classifier using the most important features to classify whether an application for credit is accepted or not.

Here's my attempt:

|--- owning a home: yes
||--- income per dependent > 5
|||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
||||--- class: Accepted
|||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
||||--- monthly credit card expenses ($) < 500
|||||--- class: Rejected
||||--- monthly credit card expenses ($) >= 500
|||||--- self employed: no
||||||--- class: Accepted
||||||--- self employed: yes
|||||||--- age (years) > 30
||||||||--- class: Rejected
||||||||--- age (years) <= 30
|||||||||--- class: Accepted
||--- income per dependent <= 5
|||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
||||--- monthly credit card expenses ($) < 200
|||||--- class: Rejected
||||--- monthly credit card expenses ($) >= 200
|||||--- self employed: no
||||||--- class: Accepted
||||||--- self employed: yes
|||||||--- age (years) > 30
||||||||--- class: Rejected
||||||||--- age (years) <= 30
|||||||||--- class: Accepted
|--- owning a home: no
||--- income per dependent > 5
|||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
||||--- monthly credit card expenses ($) < 500
|||||--- class: Rejected
||||--- monthly credit card expenses ($) >= 500
|||||--- self employed: no
||||||--- class: Accepted
||||||--- self employed: yes
|||||||--- age (years) > 30
||||||||--- class: Rejected
||||||||--- age (years) <= 30
|||||||||--- class: Accepted
||--- income per dependent <= 5
|||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
||||--- monthly credit card expenses ($) < 200
|||||--- class: Rejected
||||--- monthly credit card expenses ($) >= 200
|||||--- self employed: no
||||||--- class: Accepted
||||||--- self employed: yes
|||||||--- age (years) > 30
||||||||--- class: Rejected
||||||||--- age (years) <= 30
|||||||||--- class: Accepted

Note that this decision tree is not unique, and there may be other possible trees that can classify the data. Also, I've made some assumptions about the importance of features based on common sense, but in a real-world scenario, feature selection would typically involve more rigorous analysis.

Here's my thought process:

* Owning a home (yes/no) is a strong indicator of creditworthiness, so I used it as the first split.
* Income per dependent (1.5 to 10) is another important factor, so I used it as the next split.
* Number of derogatory reports is also an important feature, and having more than one report increases the likelihood of rejection, so I used it as a subsequent split.
* Monthly credit card expenses ($) is another significant feature, as high expenses can indicate poor financial management. I used it to further refine the tree.
* Self employment (yes/no) is a factor that can affect creditworthiness, and I used it in conjunction with age to make more fine-grained decisions.

Please note that this decision tree is not optimized for accuracy or complexity, but rather serves as an illustrative example of how features can be used to build a classification model.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 11 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['Own.home'] == 1
    nodes[1] = X['Income.per.dependent'] > 5
    nodes[2] = X['Derogatory.reports'] <= 1
    nodes[3] = X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] < 500
    nodes[4] = X['Self.employed'] == 0
    nodes[5] = X['Age'] > 30
    nodes[6] = X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] >= 200
    nodes[7] = X['Income.per.dependent'] <= 5
    nodes[8] = X['Derogatory.reports'] > 1
    nodes[9] = X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] < 200
    nodes[10] = X['Self.employed'] == 1

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:

    # Convert boolean values to integers for node outputs
    nodes = [int(x) for x in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

Note that I had to adjust some of the threshold values and logic based on the provided feature ranges and target variable encoding. This implementation assumes that `X` is a dictionary with keys matching the feature names and values corresponding to the input data points.
