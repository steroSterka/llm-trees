Based on the features you provided, I will build a decision tree classifier using the most important features to classify whether an application for credit is accepted or not.

Here's my attempt:

|--- owning a home: yes
||--- income per dependent > 5
|||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
||||--- class: Accepted
|||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
||||--- monthly credit card expenses ($) < 500
|||||--- class: Rejected
||||--- monthly credit card expenses ($) >= 500
|||||--- self employed: no
||||||--- class: Accepted
||||||--- self employed: yes
|||||||--- age (years) > 30
||||||||--- class: Rejected
||||||||--- age (years) <= 30
|||||||||--- class: Accepted
||--- income per dependent <= 5
|||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
||||--- monthly credit card expenses ($) < 200
|||||--- class: Rejected
||||--- monthly credit card expenses ($) >= 200
|||||--- self employed: no
||||||--- class: Accepted
||||||--- self employed: yes
|||||||--- age (years) > 30
||||||||--- class: Rejected
||||||||--- age (years) <= 30
|||||||||--- class: Accepted
|--- owning a home: no
||--- income per dependent > 5
|||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
||||--- monthly credit card expenses ($) < 500
|||||--- class: Rejected
||||--- monthly credit card expenses ($) >= 500
|||||--- self employed: no
||||||--- class: Accepted
||||||--- self employed: yes
|||||||--- age (years) > 30
||||||||--- class: Rejected
||||||||--- age (years) <= 30
|||||||||--- class: Accepted
||--- income per dependent <= 5
|||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
||||--- monthly credit card expenses ($) < 200
|||||--- class: Rejected
||||--- monthly credit card expenses ($) >= 200
|||||--- self employed: no
||||||--- class: Accepted
||||||--- self employed: yes
|||||||--- age (years) > 30
||||||||--- class: Rejected
||||||||--- age (years) <= 30
|||||||||--- class: Accepted

Note that this decision tree is not unique, and there may be other possible trees that can classify the data. Also, I've made some assumptions about the importance of features based on common sense, but in a real-world scenario, feature selection would typically involve more rigorous analysis.

Here's my thought process:

* Owning a home (yes/no) is a strong indicator of creditworthiness, so I used it as the first split.
* Income per dependent (1.5 to 10) is another important factor, so I used it as the next split.
* Number of derogatory reports is also an important feature, and having more than one report increases the likelihood of rejection, so I used it as a subsequent split.
* Monthly credit card expenses ($) is another significant feature, as high expenses can indicate poor financial management. I used it to further refine the tree.
* Self employment (yes/no) is a factor that can affect creditworthiness, and I used it in conjunction with age to make more fine-grained decisions.

Please note that this decision tree is not optimized for accuracy or complexity, but rather serves as an illustrative example of how features can be used to build a classification model.
=======
Based on the features you provided, I will build a decision tree classifier that predicts whether an application for credit is accepted or not. Here's my attempt:

|--- income per dependent <= 3
||--- owning a home == yes
|||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
||||--- class: Accepted
|||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
||||--- class: Not Accepted
||--- owning a home == no
|||--- monthly credit card expenses <= $500
||||--- self employed == no
|||||--- class: Accepted
||||--- self employed == yes
|||||--- class: Not Accepted
|||--- monthly credit card expenses > $500
||||--- class: Not Accepted

|--- income per dependent > 3
||--- age >= 30
|||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
||||--- class: Accepted
|||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
||||--- self employed == no
|||||--- class: Accepted
||||--- self employed == yes
|||||--- class: Not Accepted
||--- age < 30
|||--- monthly credit card expenses <= $1000
||||--- owning a home == yes
|||||--- class: Accepted
||||--- owning a home == no
|||||--- class: Not Accepted

In this decision tree, the most important features are:

1. income per dependent ( splitting at 3)
2. owning a home (splitting between yes and no)
3. number of derogatory reports (splitting at 1)
4. monthly credit card expenses (splitting at $500 and $1000)
5. self employed (splitting between yes and no)
6. age (splitting at 30)

The tree classifies applications as "Accepted" or "Not Accepted".

    # Convert boolean values to integers for node outputs
    nodes = [int(x) for x in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

Note that I had to adjust some of the threshold values and logic based on the provided feature ranges and target variable encoding. This implementation assumes that `X` is a dictionary with keys matching the feature names and values corresponding to the input data points.

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the feature values as input and returns the predicted class label (either 0 or 1) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes. The truth values are encoded as integers (0 or 1), where 1 indicates that the condition is true, and 0 indicates that it is false.

Note that I used the same threshold values as in your original decision tree implementation. You may want to adjust these thresholds based on your specific problem requirements or data characteristics.
