To build the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 for classifying whether an application for credit is accepted or not, I will select the most important features from the given list: age, income per dependent, monthly credit card expenses, owning a home, self-employed, and number of derogatory reports.

Given the nature of the problem, I would first identify the most critical factors that typically influence credit approval decisions. These often include financial stability indicators such as income, debt (which can be indirectly represented by monthly credit card expenses), and credit history (number of derogatory reports). Owning a home and being self-employed can also impact the decision but might be considered secondary to direct financial metrics.

For simplicity, let's assume that "income per dependent" is a strong indicator of financial stability, and "number of derogatory reports" directly impacts creditworthiness. These two features will be used as the primary decision nodes in our simplified tree due to their direct relevance to financial health and credit history.

Here's a constructed decision tree with a maximum depth of 2:

- **Root Node**: Income per dependent
  - **Decision**: Income per dependent <= 3 (assuming this is a threshold below which financial stability might be questionable)
    - **Left Child Node**: Number of derogatory reports
      - **Decision**: Number of derogatory reports > 0
        - **Class**: Application Not Accepted (due to poor credit history despite low income)
      - **Decision**: Number of derogatory reports == 0
        - **Class**: Application Accepted (stable financials with no derogatory marks, indicating responsible financial behavior)
  - **Decision**: Income per dependent > 3
    - **Right Child Node**: Also considering the number of derogatory reports for completeness, but primarily focusing on the income threshold as the main decision point.
      - **Decision**: This node could further consider other factors like monthly credit card expenses or self-employment status. However, given our depth constraint and simplification:
        - If we must choose a simple classification based on our primary feature (income per dependent), we might classify applications with higher income per dependent as more likely to be accepted due to presumed financial stability.
        - **Class**: Application Accepted

Simplified Decision Tree:
```
|--- Income per dependent <= 3
||--- Number of derogatory reports > 0: Not Accepted
||--- Number of derogatory reports == 0: Accepted
|--- Income per dependent > 3: Accepted
```

This tree is highly simplified and does not account for all possible factors or nuances in real-world credit application decisions. Real decision trees used by financial institutions would be more complex, consider additional factors, and likely use more sophisticated algorithms to weigh the importance of each feature.

Here is the Python function representing the decision tree for predicting whether an application for credit is accepted or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether an application for credit is accepted or not based on a decision tree.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the features.
        - 'Age': age in years
        - 'Income.per.dependent': income per dependent (1.5 to 10)
        - 'Monthly.credit.card.exp': monthly credit card expenses ($)
        - 'Own.home': owning a home (1 = yes, 0 = no)
        - 'Self.employed': self employed (1 = yes, 0 = no)
        - 'Derogatory.reports': number of derogatory reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7)

    Returns:
    prediction (int): The predicted outcome (0 = application not accepted, 1 = application accepted).
    nodes (list): A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """

    # Initialize nodes with None
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # First node: Income per dependent <= 5 (assuming this is a threshold below which financial stability might be questionable)
    nodes[0] = X['Income.per.dependent'] <= 5

    # Second node: Number of derogatory reports > 0
    nodes[1] = X['Derogatory.reports'] > 0

    # Make prediction based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Application not accepted due to poor credit history despite low income
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Application accepted (stable financials with no derogatory marks)
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Application accepted (higher income per dependent, presumed financial stability)

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

You can use this function by passing a dictionary `X` containing the features as follows:

```python
features = {
    'Age': 30,
    'Income.per.dependent': 4,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 500,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```
