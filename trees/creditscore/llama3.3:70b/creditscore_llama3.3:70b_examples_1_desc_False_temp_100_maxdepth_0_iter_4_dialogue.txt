Based on the features provided, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to determine whether an application for credit is accepted or not. Here's the resulting tree:

|--- income per dependent <= 3
||--- class: Rejected (high risk)
|--- income per dependent > 3
||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
|||--- owning a home == yes
||||--- class: Accepted (low risk)
|||--- owning a home == no
||||--- monthly credit card expenses <= $500
|||||--- class: Accepted (moderate risk)
|||||--- monthly credit card expenses > $500
||||||--- class: Rejected (high risk)
||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
|||--- self employed == yes
||||--- class: Rejected (high risk)
|||--- self employed == no
||||--- age >= 30
|||||--- class: Accepted (moderate risk)
|||||--- age < 30
||||||--- class: Rejected (high risk)

In this decision tree:

1. Income per dependent is the first feature to consider, as it has a significant impact on creditworthiness.
2. If income per dependent is low (<= 3), the application is rejected due to high risk.
3. If income per dependent is moderate to high (> 3), we then consider the number of derogatory reports.
4. If there are few or no derogatory reports (<= 1), we look at homeownership status and monthly credit card expenses to determine the level of risk.
5. If there are multiple derogatory reports (> 1), we consider self-employment status and age to assess the level of risk.

Note that this decision tree is a simplified example, and actual credit decisioning processes may involve more complex rules and additional features.

Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier based on the provided features and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether an application for credit is accepted or not.

    Args:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the input features.
        - Age (years)
        - Income.per.dependent (1.5 to 10)
        - Monthly.credit.card.exp ($)
        - Own.home (1 = yes, 0 = no)
        - Self.employed (1 = yes, 0 = no)
        - Derogatory.reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7)

    Returns:
    prediction (int): The predicted target variable (0 = application rejected, 1 = application accepted).
    nodes (list): A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """

    # Initialize the nodes with None
    nodes = 6 * [None]

    # Node 1: Income.per.dependent <= 3
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3

    # Node 2: Derogatory.reports <= 1
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1

    # Node 3: Own.home == 1 (yes)
    nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 1

    # Node 4: Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 500
    nodes[3] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 500

    # Node 5: Age >= 30
    nodes[4] = X["Age"] >= 30

    # Node 6: Self.employed == 0 (no)
    nodes[5] = X["Self.employed"] == 0

    if nodes[0]:  # Income.per.dependent <= 3
        prediction = 0  # Application rejected due to low income per dependent
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # Derogatory.reports <= 1
            if nodes[2]:  # Own.home == 1 (yes)
                prediction = 1  # Application accepted (low risk)
            else:  # Own.home == 0 (no)
                if nodes[3]:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 500
                    prediction = 1  # Application accepted (moderate risk)
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Application rejected due to high credit card expenses
        else:  # Derogatory.reports > 1
            if nodes[5] and nodes[4]:  # Self.employed == 0 (no) and Age >= 30
                prediction = 1  # Application accepted (moderate risk)
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Application rejected due to high derogatory reports or self-employment

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, containing the features. It then evaluates the decision tree based on these features and returns the predicted target variable (`prediction`) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes (`nodes`). Note that I've used integer encoding for the nodes (1 = True, 0 = False) to match the problem requirements.

You can use this function like this:

```python
X = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 5.2,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 200,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```
