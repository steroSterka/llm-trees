To build the decision tree for classifying whether an application for credit is accepted or not based on the given features, we'll use a similar structure as your example. However, without actual data, I'll make assumptions about how each feature might influence the decision to accept or reject a credit application. The features are:

1. Age (years)
2. Income per dependent (1.5 to 10)
3. Monthly credit card expenses ($)
4. Owning a home (yes / no)
5. Self employed (yes / no)
6. Number of derogatory reports

Decision Tree:
|--- number of derogatory reports > 2
||--- class: Reject (High risk due to multiple derogatory reports)
|--- number of derogatory reports <= 2
||--- income per dependent < 3
|||--- class: Reject (Low income per dependent, may struggle with payments)
||--- income per dependent >= 3
|||--- monthly credit card expenses > $1000
|||--- class: Reject (High expenses relative to potential income)
|||--- monthly credit card expenses <= $1000
||||--- owning a home == yes
|||||--- class: Accept (Stable asset, lower risk)
||||--- owning a home == no
|||||--- self employed == yes
||||||--- class: Reject (Unstable income source)
|||||--- self employed == no
||||||--- age > 30
|||||||--- class: Accept (Established income, lower risk with age)
||||||--- age <= 30
|||||||--- class: Reject (Younger applicants with less financial history)

This decision tree uses the following logic:
- Multiple derogatory reports indicate a high risk for lending.
- Low income per dependent suggests difficulty in making payments.
- High monthly credit card expenses relative to income indicate potential financial strain.
- Owning a home is seen as a stabilizing factor, reducing the risk of default.
- Being self-employed can introduce uncertainty about future income.
- Older applicants (above 30) are considered less risky due to potentially having more established financial histories.

Please note, this decision tree is a simplified example and real-world credit decisions involve many more factors and complexities. The thresholds used here (e.g., $1000 for monthly expenses, age of 30) are arbitrary without actual data analysis. In practice, machine learning models like decision trees are trained on large datasets to determine the optimal splits and features that best predict outcomes like creditworthiness.

Here's how you can format the decision tree as a Python function based on your given features and target variable.

```python
def predict_credit_application(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether an application for credit is accepted or not.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing the input features with their respective values.
             The keys should match the feature names exactly, including case and spacing.
             For example: 'Age', 'Income.per.dependent', 'Monthly.credit.card.exp', 
                         'Own.home', 'Self.employed', 'Derogatory.reports'
    
    Returns:
    prediction (int): 1 if the application for credit is accepted, 0 otherwise.
    nodes (list): A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
                  Each node's value will be 1 if the condition is satisfied and 0 otherwise.
    """

    # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = [None] * 6
    
    # Node 0: Check if the number of derogatory reports is more than 2
    nodes[0] = X['Derogatory.reports'] > 2
    
    # Node 1: Check if the income per dependent is less than 3
    nodes[1] = X['Income.per.dependent'] < 3
    
    # Node 2: Check if the monthly credit card expenses are more than $1000
    nodes[2] = X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] > 1000
    
    # Node 3: Check if the applicant owns a home
    nodes[3] = X['Own.home'] == 1
    
    # Node 4: Check if the applicant is self-employed
    nodes[4] = X['Self.employed'] == 1
    
    # Node 5: Check if the age of the applicant is more than 30
    nodes[5] = X['Age'] > 30
    
    prediction = None
    
    if nodes[0]:  # More than 2 derogatory reports, high risk
        prediction = 0
    elif nodes[1]:  # Low income per dependent, may struggle with payments
        prediction = 0
    elif nodes[2]:  # High monthly credit card expenses, potential financial strain
        prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[3]:  # Owning a home is seen as a stabilizing factor
            prediction = 1
        elif nodes[4]:  # Being self-employed introduces uncertainty about future income
            prediction = 0
        elif nodes[5] and X['Income.per.dependent'] >= 3:  # Older applicants with stable income are less risky
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    
    # Convert boolean values in nodes to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
X = {
    'Age': 32,
    'Income.per.dependent': 5.2,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 800,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict_credit_application(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the respective feature values. The function returns a prediction (0 or 1) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.

Please note that this is a simplified example based on the given features and target variable. In practice, you may need to consider more complex relationships between the features and the target variable, and use techniques like cross-validation to evaluate the performance of your model.
