Based on the provided features, I will induce a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 to classify whether an application for credit is accepted or not.

Here is the decision tree:

|--- income per dependent <= 4
||--- class: Not Accepted (assuming lower income per dependent indicates higher risk)
|--- income per dependent > 4
||--- number of derogatory reports <= 1
|||--- class: Accepted (assuming higher income and fewer derogatory reports indicate lower risk)
||--- number of derogatory reports > 1
|||--- class: Not Accepted (assuming multiple derogatory reports indicate higher risk)

Note that I have used the following features to build the decision tree:

1. Income per dependent: This feature is a good indicator of the applicant's financial stability and ability to repay the credit.
2. Number of derogatory reports: This feature indicates the applicant's credit history and likelihood of default.

The other features, such as age, monthly credit card expenses, owning a home, and self-employment status, may also be relevant in determining creditworthiness, but I have not used them in this decision tree due to the maximum depth constraint. 

Please note that this is a simplified example and actual credit scoring models would consider many more features and use more complex algorithms.

Here is the decision tree function based on your features and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether an application for credit is accepted or not.

    Args:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the input features.
        - Age (years)
        - Income.per.dependent (1.5 to 10)
        - Monthly.credit.card.exp ($)
        - Own.home (1 = yes, 0 = no)
        - Self.employed (1 = yes, 0 = no)
        - Derogatory.reports (number of derogatory reports)

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
        - prediction (int): 0 if the application is not accepted, 1 if it is accepted
        - nodes (list): A list of boolean values indicating whether each condition in the decision tree is met

    """
    # Initialize the list to store node values
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # First node: income per dependent <= 5.0
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 5.0
    
    # Second node (only evaluated if first node is true): number of derogatory reports <= 1
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    else:
        nodes[1] = False

    # Make the prediction based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0] and nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1  # Application accepted
    elif nodes[0] and not nodes[1]:
        prediction = 0  # Application not accepted due to high number of derogatory reports
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Application not accepted due to low income per dependent

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```
In this function, we first check the income per dependent and then, if it's below or equal to a certain threshold (in this case 5.0), we evaluate the number of derogatory reports. If both conditions are met, we predict that the application will be accepted; otherwise, we predict that it won't be.

Note: I used `5.0` as the income per dependent threshold because you provided a range for `Income.per.dependent` (1.5 to 10). Adjust this value according to your needs and data analysis results. Also note that `nodes[1]` is only evaluated if `nodes[0]` is true, which means it won't affect the prediction when income per dependent is above the threshold.

You can call the function with a sample input dictionary like so:

```python
sample_input = {
    "Age": 30,
    "Income.per.dependent": 4.5,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 500.0,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(sample_input)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```
