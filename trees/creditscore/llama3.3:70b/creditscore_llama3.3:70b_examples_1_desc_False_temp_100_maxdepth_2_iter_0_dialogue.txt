To build a decision tree classifier with the given features for determining whether an application for credit is accepted or not, we first need to understand that the outcome (accepted or not) depends on various factors such as financial stability, credit history, and personal circumstances. The provided features include:

1. **Age (years)**: This could be a factor in assessing stability and responsibility.
2. **Income per dependent (1.5 to 10)**: Higher income suggests better ability to repay debts.
3. **Monthly credit card expenses ($)**: High expenses might indicate over-reliance on credit, potentially making an applicant riskier.
4. **Owning a home (yes / no)**: Homeownership can be seen as a sign of financial stability and responsibility.
5. **Self-employed (yes / no)**: Self-employment can introduce uncertainty regarding income stability.
6. **Number of derogatory reports**: More reports suggest a poorer credit history, making an applicant riskier.

Given the task is to build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 for classifying whether an application for credit is accepted or not based on these features, and without specific data or thresholds provided in the question, I'll create a hypothetical but logical decision tree structure using the most relevant features that typically influence credit decisions:

### Decision Tree:
|--- Number of derogatory reports <= 1
||--- Income per dependent >= 5
|||--- class: Accepted (Credit application accepted due to good income and minimal negative credit history)
||--- Income per dependent < 5
|||--- class: Rejected (Lower income per dependent combined with some negative credit history may pose a risk)

|--- Number of derogatory reports > 1
||--- Age >= 30 AND Owning a home == yes
|||--- class: Accepted (Despite more significant credit issues, the applicant's age and homeownership suggest stability)
||--- Age < 30 OR Owning a home == no
|||--- class: Rejected (Younger applicants without a stable asset like a home, combined with multiple derogatory reports, pose too high a risk)

This decision tree focuses on the **number of derogatory reports** as the primary feature for the first split because credit history is crucial in assessing the risk of lending. The secondary features used for further splits are **income per dependent**, **age**, and **owning a home**, which provide insights into financial stability, responsibility, and the ability to repay debts.

Please note, this decision tree is hypothetical and based on general principles of credit assessment. Actual decision trees would be built using specific data and might include more nuanced considerations and thresholds determined through statistical analysis or machine learning algorithms.

Here is the decision tree formatted as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether an application for credit is accepted or not based on the given features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the features.
            - Age (years)
            - Income.per.dependent (income per dependent, 1.5 to 10)
            - Monthly.credit.card.exp (monthly credit card expenses, $)
            - Own.home (owning a home, 1 = yes, 0 = no)
            - Self.employed (self employed, 1 = yes, 0 = no)
            - Derogatory.reports (number of derogatory reports, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7)

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
            - prediction (int): 0 if the application is not accepted, 1 if accepted
            - nodes (list): A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes
    """

    # Initialize the nodes list with None values
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # First node: Number of derogatory reports <= 1
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1

    # Second node: Income per dependent >= 5 (only considered if first node is True)
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] >= 5 if nodes[0] else False

    # Make prediction based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1 if nodes[1] else 0
    else:
        # Additional conditions for cases where number of derogatory reports > 1
        # For simplicity, we'll consider Age and Own.home here
        age_condition = X["Age"] >= 30
        own_home_condition = X["Own.home"] == 1
        prediction = 1 if age_condition and own_home_condition else 0

    # Convert boolean nodes to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes


# Example usage:
X = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 6,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 500,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)

```

In this example, we first check the number of derogatory reports (`Derogatory.reports`). If it's less than or equal to 1, we then consider the income per dependent (`Income.per.dependent`). If both conditions are met (i.e., `nodes[0]` and `nodes[1]` are True), we predict that the application is accepted. For cases where `Derogatory.reports` is greater than 1, we apply additional conditions based on age and homeownership for simplicity.

The function returns a tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of integers representing the truth values of the inner nodes (1 for True, 0 for False).
