Alright, so I have this problem where I need to build a decision tree classifier to determine whether an application for credit is accepted or not. The features provided are age in years, income per dependent ranging from 1.5 to 10, monthly credit card expenses in dollars, owning a home (yes/no), self-employed (yes/no), and the number of derogatory reports.

First, I need to understand each feature and how it might relate to credit approval. Age could be relevant because older individuals might have longer credit histories or more stable financial situations. Income per dependent is crucial as higher income generally means better ability to repay debts. Monthly credit card expenses can indicate spending habits; lower expenses are usually preferable. Owning a home is often seen as a sign of stability and financial responsibility. Self-employment can be a bit tricky because it may imply variable income, which could affect creditworthiness. The number of derogatory reports directly relates to credit history – more reports typically mean higher risk.

Next, I should think about the possible class labels, which are "Credit Accepted" or "Not Accepted." My goal is to create a tree that effectively splits these classes based on the given features.

Since the maximum depth allowed is 2, my tree will have a root node and up to two levels of decision nodes. At each level, I'll choose the feature that best splits the data. I need to determine which feature is most important at the first split (root), then for each subsequent branch.

Starting with the root: Among all features, income per dependent might be the most indicative because a higher income generally means better creditworthiness. So perhaps splitting based on income makes sense. But wait, the number of derogatory reports could be more critical since it's directly tied to past credit behavior, which is a key factor in credit decisions.

I'm torn between income and derogatory reports for the first split. Let me think: Lenders often prioritize credit history, so maybe derogatory reports should come first. If someone has too many derogatory marks, they might be automatically denied regardless of other factors.

So, I'll set the root as number of derogatory reports <= 2. This is a common cutoff in credit decisions; more than two could signal poor credit management.

Now, for each branch under that:

1. For the left node where derogatory reports are <= 2:
   - Next, I should choose another feature to split further. Considering income per dependent as the next important factor. A higher income would likely lead to approval.
   - So, if income is high (say >6), then it's more likely to be approved. Otherwise, maybe not.

2. For the right node where derogatory reports are >2:
   - Even with other factors, having more than two derogatory reports might lead to rejection. However, sometimes lenders consider other aspects.
   - Maybe check if income is high enough to compensate for poor credit history. If income per dependent is above a certain threshold (say 8), maybe it's still approved. Otherwise, not.

Wait, but the maximum depth is 2, so each path from root should have at most two splits. So the right node after derogatory reports >2 might go straight to "Not Accepted," unless another feature can override that.

Alternatively, considering the example provided earlier with petal width as the first split and then another feature as the second, I think in this case, we can have each branch split once more before reaching a leaf node. But since depth is 2, the tree will only have two levels beyond the root? Or does it include the root?

Wait, maximum depth of 2 means that the longest path from root to leaf is 2 edges, so including root, it's three levels deep.

But in the example given for Iris dataset:

Root: petal width <=0.8 → class setosa

Then, petal width >0.8 splits into two more nodes based on petal width again, which seems odd because it's using the same feature twice. Maybe I should choose different features at each split.

In our case, for credit decision:

Root: number of derogatory reports <=2 / >2

For each branch, pick another feature to split further.

So under "derogatory reports <=2", maybe split on income per dependent, and under "derogatory reports >2", maybe split on owning a home or self-employment status.

Wait, but the user in their example used petal width twice. So perhaps it's acceptable to use the same feature multiple times? Or is that a mistake?

In standard decision trees, each internal node can use any feature, including repeated ones, as long as it improves the split.

But I think in practice, using different features at each level might make more sense and improve model performance by considering various aspects of the data.

So, for derogatory reports <=2:

Next split could be based on income per dependent. Let's say if income >6 → Accept, else Reject.

For derogatory reports >2:

Next split could be based on owning a home. If yes → maybe Accept, else Reject.

Alternatively, self-employed: being self-employed might be seen as higher risk, so even with high income, it might affect the decision.

But since we have to pick two features at max depth 2, I think using derogatory reports as root and then splitting on either income or owning a home would make sense.

Wait, but in the example provided earlier, they used petal width twice. So perhaps I can follow that structure, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach here.

Alternatively, perhaps after derogatory reports, using age could be useful, as older individuals might have better credit histories or more stable incomes. But age alone isn't always a reliable indicator.

I think income per dependent is more directly related to repayment ability, so maybe that should come next in the hierarchy.

So, my plan:

Root: number of derogatory reports <=2

Left child (<=2): split on income per dependent >6 → Accept; else Reject.

Right child (>2): split on owning a home yes → Maybe check another feature? But since max depth is 2, I can only go one more level. So under right node, maybe if they own a home, it's less risky, so perhaps still consider accepting them, or if not, reject.

But wait, maximum depth of 2 means that the tree has two levels beyond root? Or including root?

Actually, in decision trees, depth is usually measured as the number of edges from root to leaf. So a maximum depth of 2 allows up to three levels (root plus two splits). But if I only have two splits after root, it's more manageable.

Alternatively, maybe I should structure it so that each branch can split once.

Let me try:

Root: Number of Derogatory Reports <=2

Left child:
- If Income per dependent >6 → Accept
- Else → Reject

Right child (Derogatory Reports >2):
- If Own Home = yes → Maybe check another feature, but since depth is limited, perhaps directly classify as Accept or Reject. But in reality, having more derogatory reports is bad, so maybe even with owning a home, it's still rejected unless other factors are strong.

Alternatively, for the right node, split on Income per dependent >8 → Accept; else Reject.

But I'm not sure if income can compensate for poor credit history. It might depend on policy, but in many cases, high enough income could offset some risk.

So, let's structure it as:

Root: Number of Derogatory Reports <=2

Left:
- Income per dependent >6 → Accept
- Else → Reject

Right (Derogatory >2):
- Income per dependent >8 → Accept
- Else → Reject

This way, even with poor credit history, high income can still lead to approval.

But I'm not sure if this is the best approach. Maybe other features like monthly expenses or self-employment could play a role in the second split under derogatory reports >2.

For example, for the right node:

If Self Employed = no → Accept; else Reject.

But that might not capture the financial stability as much as income does.

Alternatively, Monthly Credit Card Expenses <= $500 (assuming lower expenses are better) → Accept; else Reject.

But I'm trying to stick with features that have a direct impact on creditworthiness. Income and derogatory reports are top factors, followed by owning assets like a home.

Another approach could be:

Root: Number of Derogatory Reports <=2

Left:
- Own Home = yes → Accept
- Else → Reject

Right (Derogatory >2):
- Income per dependent >8 → Accept
- Else → Reject

This way, if someone has derogatory reports but owns a home, they might be more stable and thus approved.

But I'm not sure which approach is better. It depends on what's more important: income or owning a home when considering credit approval.

In reality, both are important, but perhaps income is more directly related to repayment ability.

Given that, maybe the first split after derogatory reports should be based on income.

So final structure:

Root: Number of Derogatory Reports <=2

Left:
- Income per dependent >6 → Accept
- Else → Reject

Right (Derogatory >2):
- Income per dependent >8 → Accept
- Else → Reject

But the user's example used the same feature twice, so maybe I can do that too. Let me check.

In their example:

Petal width was used at root and then again in one of the branches. So perhaps it's acceptable to use the same feature multiple times if it improves the split.

So, for our case, using Number of Derogatory Reports as the first split, and then using another feature like Income per dependent or Own Home.

Alternatively, we can structure it differently:

Root: Own Home = yes

Left (yes):
- Number of Derogatory Reports <=2 → Accept
- Else → Reject

Right (no):
- Income per dependent >8 → Accept
- Else → Reject

This approach first checks if someone owns a home, which is a significant asset indicating stability. If they do and have few derogatory reports, they're approved. If not, it looks at their income.

But I'm not sure if this structure adheres to the maximum depth of 2 correctly.

Let me count the levels:

- Root: Own Home
   - Left: Derogatory <=2 → Leaf (depth 2)
   - Right: Income >8 → Leaf (depth 2)

Yes, that's within max depth of 2. So this structure is acceptable.

Alternatively, starting with income as root might be better because it's a strong indicator.

But in the user example, they used petal width twice, so perhaps it's better to stick with using the same feature if necessary.

However, I think using different features at each level provides a more balanced approach.

So, considering all this, I'll structure my decision tree as follows:

Root: Number of Derogatory Reports <=2

Left (<=2):
   - Income per dependent >6 → Accept
   - Else → Reject

Right (>2):
   - Own Home = yes → Maybe still consider accepting if they have a stable asset. Alternatively, check income again.

But since we're limited to two splits, I can only go one level deeper from the root.

So perhaps:

Root: Number of Derogatory Reports <=2

Left:
   - Income >6 → Accept
   - Else → Reject

Right:
   - Own Home = yes → Accept
   - Else → Reject

This way, even with more derogatory reports, owning a home might compensate. Alternatively, using income again.

But I think this structure is logical because:

1. First, check credit history (derogatory reports). If it's good, then look at their ability to repay via income.
2. If credit history is bad, then assess their stability via home ownership.

Yes, that makes sense. So the tree would be:

|--- number of derogatory reports <= 2
||--- income per dependent >6 → class: Credit Accepted
||--- else → class: Credit Not Accepted
|--- number of derogatory reports > 2
||--- owning a home = yes → class: Credit Accepted
||--- else → class: Credit Not Accepted

But wait, the maximum depth is 2. Let me count:

Root (depth 0)
- Left child (depth 1): split on income
   - Leaf nodes at depth 2
- Right child (depth 1): split on owning a home
   - Leaf nodes at depth 2

Yes, that's correct because the path from root to any leaf is two edges, so maximum depth is 2.

I think this structure covers both credit history and stability/assets. It also uses the most important features: number of derogatory reports (credit history) and income/owning a home (stability and repayment ability).

So I'll go with that.
</think>

To classify whether an application for credit is accepted or not, we'll use a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. The tree will utilize the most important features: number of derogatory reports, income per dependent, and owning a home.

### Decision Tree:

|--- number of derogatory reports <= 2
||--- income per dependent >6 → class: Credit Accepted
||--- else → class: Credit Not Accepted
|--- number of derogatory reports > 2
||--- owning a home = yes → class: Credit Accepted
||--- else → class: Credit Not Accepted

### Explanation:

1. **Root Node (Depth 0):** 
   - The tree starts by examining the `number of derogatory reports`. This is crucial as it reflects past credit behavior.

2. **Left Branch (<=2 Derogatory Reports) (Depth 1):**
   - If there are two or fewer derogatory reports, the next consideration is `income per dependent`.
     - **Leaf Node (Depth 2):** An income above 6 indicates higher repayment ability and leads to acceptance.
     - **Leaf Node (Depth 2):** Income of 6 or less may not sufficiently cover obligations, leading to rejection.

3. **Right Branch (>2 Derogatory Reports) (Depth 1):**
   - When there are more than two derogatory reports, the tree evaluates `owning a home`.
     - **Leaf Node (Depth 2):** Home ownership suggests financial stability and responsibility, resulting in acceptance.
     - **Leaf Node (Depth 2):** Lack of home ownership may indicate lesser stability, leading to rejection.

This structure effectively balances credit history with current financial stability, ensuring informed credit decisions.


#########################


<think>
Alright, so I need to create a Python function that predicts whether a credit application is accepted or not based on the given features. The decision tree has a maximum depth of two, which means it can have up to three layers: the root and two levels of children.

First, let's look at the features provided:

- Age (years)
- Income.per.dependent (1.5 to 10)
- Monthly.credit.card.exp ($)
- Own.home (yes/no, encoded as 1/0)
- Self.employed (yes/no, encoded as 1/0)
- Derogatory.reports (number of derogatory reports: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7)

The target variable is whether the application for credit is accepted or not, encoded as 0 (no) and 1 (yes).

From the earlier decision tree example provided by the assistant, it seems that "Derogatory.reports" is used at the root node with a threshold of <=2. Then, depending on that condition, either "Income.per.dependent" or "Own.home" is evaluated.

So, the decision tree logic appears to be:

1. Root Node: Derogatory.reports <= 2
   - If true:
     - Check Income.per.dependent >6
       - If true: Accept (class = 1)
       - Else: Reject (class = 0)
   - If false:
     - Check Own.home == 1
       - If true: Accept (class = 1)
       - Else: Reject (class = 0)

Now, I need to translate this logic into a Python function. The function should take a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and return two things:

- A single prediction (0 or 1)
- A list of truth values representing the conditions evaluated at each inner node

The list of truth values will have entries corresponding to whether each condition in the inner nodes is satisfied (1 if true, 0 otherwise).

Let's outline the steps for the function:

1. Extract the relevant features from the input dictionary `X`.
2. Evaluate the conditions at each inner node.
3. Based on these evaluations, determine the prediction.
4. Return both the prediction and the list of truth values.

First, I need to identify the inner nodes in this tree. Since the maximum depth is two, there are two levels below the root:

- First level: Derogatory.reports <= 2
- Second level:
  - If first condition is true: Income.per.dependent >6
  - Else: Own.home ==1

But since we have to represent this as a list of truth values corresponding to inner nodes, and each node can only evaluate one condition, I need to map these conditions properly.

Perhaps the function will evaluate both conditions regardless of the path taken in the tree for simplicity. But logically, once a certain branch is taken, some conditions are not evaluated. However, for the purpose of this function, since we're collecting all truth values of inner nodes, it might be acceptable to evaluate all conditions and then decide based on them.

Wait, looking at the example provided by the user:

In their function `predict`, they have a list `nodes` with two elements corresponding to "HbA1c_level <= 6.7" and "blood_glucose_level <= 210". These are the inner nodes evaluated in their decision tree.

Similarly, for our credit prediction function, I need to identify which features are used as conditions in the inner nodes and create a list that captures whether each condition was met (1) or not (0).

So, let's define the inner nodes:

- Node 0: Derogatory.reports <=2
- Node 1: Income.per.dependent >6

But wait, in the decision tree, when Node 0 is true, we check Node 1. When Node 0 is false, we check Own.home ==1. So, actually, there are three inner nodes:

- Node 0: Derogatory.reports <=2
- Node 1: Income.per.dependent >6 (evaluated if Node 0 is true)
- Node 2: Own.home ==1 (evaluated if Node 0 is false)

But since the maximum depth is two, I think it's acceptable to have three inner nodes as they are at different levels.

However, the function needs to return a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. It would make sense to include all conditions that are part of the decision-making process in the tree.

So, perhaps the `nodes` list will capture these three conditions:

- Node 0: Derogatory.reports <=2
- Node 1: Income.per.dependent >6
- Node 2: Own.home ==1

But logically, if Node 0 is true, only Node 1 is evaluated; if false, then Node 2 is evaluated.

However, for simplicity in the list, we can still include all three conditions, even though in practice, one of them (Node 1 or Node 2) would not be used based on Node 0's result. But since the function needs to return a list representing the truth values of all inner nodes, it's better to evaluate all of them regardless.

Alternatively, we can structure the `nodes` list to only include the conditions that are actually evaluated in the path taken by the prediction. But the user's example seems to include both conditions regardless, even though in their function they have:

if nodes[0]:
    if nodes[1:]:
else:

But looking at their function:

They set nodes = 2*[None], then assign nodes[0] and nodes[1]. Then use them in conditional checks.

So, perhaps the function should evaluate all inner node conditions upfront, store them in a list, and then use that list to make predictions based on the decision tree logic.

In our case:

nodes = [
    X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 2,
    X["Income.per.dependent"] >6,
    X["Own.home"] ==1
]

But since we have three conditions, perhaps it's better to include all three in the list. However, considering that at each level of depth beyond root, only certain nodes are evaluated.

Wait, the maximum depth is two, which means up to two levels after the root. So, the inner nodes would be:

- First level: Node 0 (Derogatory.reports <=2)
- Second level:
  - If Node 0 true: Node 1 (Income.per.dependent >6)
  - Else: Node 2 (Own.home ==1)

So, it's two levels after the root. Therefore, there are three inner nodes in total:

Node 0 at depth 1,
Nodes 1 and 2 also at depth 2.

But in terms of code, perhaps the function should evaluate all these conditions first, store their truth values, then use them to determine the prediction path.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to represent only two inner nodes since the tree has a maximum depth of two. But I think including three makes sense because each decision after root adds another node.

But to match the user's example, which for depth 2 had two inner nodes (HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level), perhaps in our case, we can have two inner nodes:

- Node 0: Derogatory.reports <=2
- Node 1: Income.per.dependent >6

And then a third node: Own.home ==1.

But the user's example only had two nodes. So maybe for consistency, I should have three nodes in the list but set unused ones based on the path taken.

Alternatively, perhaps it's acceptable to include all conditions evaluated as inner nodes, regardless of the depth.

But considering that the decision tree has a maximum depth of two, there are at most two levels after root: first level is Node 0 (Derogatory.reports <=2), second level includes Nodes 1 and 2 (Income.per.dependent >6 and Own.home ==1).

So perhaps in total, three inner nodes exist:

nodes = [
    X["Derogatory.reports"] <=2,
    X["Income.per.dependent"] >6,
    X["Own.home"] ==1
]

Then, the prediction is made based on these node evaluations.

But I need to map this into a function that returns both the prediction and the list of truth values (0 or 1) for each inner node condition.

So the function would be something like:

def predict_credit(X):
    nodes = [
        X["Derogatory.reports"] <=2,
        X["Income.per.dependent"] >6,
        X["Own.home"] ==1
    ]
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Accept
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Reject
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Accept
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Reject
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]

Wait, but the user's example had a list of two elements, not three. So perhaps I need to adjust this.

Looking back at the user's example:

Their decision tree had two inner nodes: HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level. The function evaluated both and stored them in a list of size 2, then used those for prediction.

In our case, since we have three inner node conditions (Derogatory.reports <=2, Income.per.dependent >6, Own.home ==1), but the maximum depth is two, perhaps it's structured as:

- Root: Derogatory.reports <=2
  - Left child (true): Income.per.dependent >6
    - Leaf nodes based on that condition.
  - Right child (false): Own.home ==1
    - Leaf nodes based on that condition.

So, the inner nodes are at depth 1 and 2. Therefore, perhaps there are two inner nodes: one at depth 1 (Derogatory.reports <=2) and then depending on that, either Income.per.dependent >6 or Own.home ==1 at depth 2.

But since in a decision tree of maximum depth 2, each path from root to leaf can have up to two splits. So in this case, there are three inner nodes across different branches:

- Node 0: Derogatory.reports <=2 (depth 1)
- Node 1: Income.per.dependent >6 (depth 2, left branch)
- Node 2: Own.home ==1 (depth 2, right branch)

Therefore, the list of truth values should include all these inner nodes. But since each prediction path uses two conditions, while there are three in total across both branches.

However, to align with the user's example which had a list of size equal to the number of inner node conditions (two), perhaps in our case, we can represent it as three elements: [Derogatory.reports <=2, Income.per.dependent >6, Own.home ==1].

Thus, the function would evaluate all these conditions upfront and include them in the nodes list.

So, finalizing this:

def predict_credit(X):
    # Extract necessary features
    derogatory_reports = X['Derogatory.reports']
    income_per_dependent = X['Income.per.dependent']
    own_home = X['Own.home']
    
    # Evaluate inner node conditions
    node0 = derogatory_reports <= 2
    node1 = income_per_dependent >6
    node2 = own_home ==1
    
    nodes = [node0, node1, node2]
    
    if node0:
        prediction = 1 if node1 else 0
    else:
        prediction = 1 if node2 else 0
    
    return prediction, [int(n) for n in nodes]

Wait, but the user's example only had two inner nodes, not three. So perhaps I need to adjust this.

Alternatively, maybe the function should have a list of size equal to the maximum number of inner nodes possible given the depth. Since max depth is 2, the number of inner nodes is 3 (depth1:1 node, depth2:2 nodes). But in their example with max depth 2, it had two inner nodes.

Perhaps to align more closely with that, I should structure the function to have a list of size 2, even though logically there are three conditions. Maybe only evaluating the relevant nodes based on the path taken.

But in reality, all conditions are evaluated upfront regardless of the path. So perhaps it's better to include all three as per our logic.

Alternatively, maybe the decision tree uses two inner nodes: one at depth1 and another at depth2 along a single path, but since there are two possible paths (left and right), perhaps each has its own node at depth2.

In code terms, this can be handled by evaluating all conditions first.

So, I think including all three in the nodes list makes sense.

Therefore, the function would evaluate all three conditions: Derogatory.reports <=2, Income.per.dependent >6, Own.home ==1.

Then, use them to determine the prediction path:

if node0:
    if node1:
        prediction =1
    else:
        prediction=0
else:
    if node2:
        prediction=1
    else:
        prediction=0

And return [int(node0), int(node1), int(node2)]

But the user's example had a list of size 2. Perhaps in their case, they only had two inner nodes evaluated.

To match that, perhaps I should include all three conditions as inner nodes regardless of the path.

Therefore, the function would look like this:

def predict_credit(X):
    # Extract necessary features
    derogatory_reports = X['Derogatory.reports']
    income_per_dependent = X['Income.per.dependent']
    own_home = X['Own.home']
    
    # Evaluate inner node conditions
    node0 = derogatory_reports <= 2
    node1 = income_per_dependent >6
    node2 = own_home ==1
    
    nodes = [node0, node1, node2]
    
    if node0:
        prediction = 1 if node1 else 0
    else:
        prediction = 1 if node2 else 0
    
    return prediction, [int(n) for n in nodes]

But perhaps the user expects a list of size two. Alternatively, maybe not; their example had two because that's how many inner nodes they had.

In our case, we have three inner nodes: Derogatory.reports <=2 is at depth1, and both Income.per.dependent >6 and Own.home ==1 are at depth2.

So the list size should be 3 to represent all inner node conditions. Therefore, including all three makes sense.

Thus, the function will return a prediction (0 or 1) and a list of three elements indicating whether each condition was met.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The user's example had two inner nodes because their tree had two splits: first HbA1c_level <=6.7, then blood_glucose_level <=210.

Similarly, in our case:

- First split: Derogatory.reports <=2
  - If true:
    - Second split: Income.per.dependent >6
  - Else:
    - Second split: Own.home ==1

Therefore, each branch after the root has one more inner node. So total inner nodes are two: Node0 and either Node1 or Node2 depending on the path.

But since both Node1 and Node2 exist as conditions in different branches, perhaps they should both be included in the list.

Thus, to capture all possible inner nodes used in any decision path, we include them all in the nodes list.

Hence, the function will evaluate all three conditions upfront and return a list of size 3.
</think>

To create a function that predicts credit approval based on given criteria with a maximum depth of two decisions after the root node, we can structure it as follows:

1. **Extract Relevant Features**: Identify the features used in our decision tree: `Derogatory.reports`, `Income.per.dependent`, and `Own.home`.
2. **Evaluate Inner Node Conditions**: Assess each condition at the respective nodes:
   - Node 0: Whether the number of derogatory reports is less than or equal to 2.
   - Node 1: Whether income per dependent exceeds 6.
   - Node 2: Whether the individual owns their home.
3. **Determine Prediction Path**: Based on the evaluation of these nodes:
   - If Node 0 is true, use Node 1 to determine approval.
   - If Node 0 is false, use Node 2 instead.
4. **Return Results**: The function returns both the prediction result and a list indicating whether each condition was met.

Here's how you can implement this:

```python
def predict_credit_approval(X):
    # Extract necessary features from input dictionary X
    derogatory_reports = X['Derogatory.reports']
    income_per_dependent = X['Income.per.dependent']
    own_home = X['Own.home']
    
    # Evaluate conditions for each inner node in the decision tree
    node0 = derogatory_reports <= 2
    node1 = income_per_dependent > 6
    node2 = own_home == 1
    
    nodes = [node0, node1, node2]
    
    if node0:
        prediction = 1 if node1 else 0  # Approve if Node1 is true, else reject
    else:
        prediction = 1 if node2 else 0  # Check Node2 for approval if Node0 is false
    
    # Convert boolean values in nodes to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0)
    nodes_int = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes_int

# Example usage:
applicant_data = {
    'Derogatory.reports': 2,
    'Income.per.dependent': 7,
    'Own.home': 0
}

approval, nodes_result = predict_credit_approval(applicant_data)
print(f"Credit Approval Prediction: {approval}")
print(f"Nodes Evaluation Results: {nodes_result}")
```

**Explanation**:

- **Extract Features**: The function begins by extracting the necessary features from the input dictionary `X`.
- **Evaluate Nodes**: Each inner node condition is evaluated and stored in a list called `nodes`.
- **Determine Approval**: Using the evaluated conditions, the function follows the decision tree logic to determine whether credit should be approved.
- **Return Results**: Finally, it returns both the approval prediction (0 or 1) and a list of integers indicating whether each condition was met.

This approach ensures that all relevant conditions are checked upfront, aligning with the structure of a decision tree up to two levels deep after the root node.
