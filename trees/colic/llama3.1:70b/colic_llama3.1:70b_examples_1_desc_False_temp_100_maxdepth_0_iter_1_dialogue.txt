To build a decision tree for classifying whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not, we need to identify the most important features from the provided dataset. I'll use a subset of the features that are likely to be relevant for this classification task.

After analyzing the features, I've selected the following top 5 features:

1. Degree of Pain (none / mild / moderate / severe)
2. Abdominal Distension (none / slight / moderate / severe)
3. Nasogastric Reflux (>1 liter / <1 liter / none)
4. Rectal Examination Findings (normal / increased / decreased / absent)
5. Abdominocentesis Appearance (clear / cloudy / serosanguinous)

Here's a decision tree based on these features:

|--- Degree of Pain: severe
||--- class: surgical

|--- Degree of Pain: moderate or mild
||--- Abdominal Distension: severe
|||--- class: surgical

|--- Degree of Pain: moderate or mild
||--- Abdominal Distension: slight or none
|||--- Nasogastric Reflux: >1 liter
||||--- class: surgical

|--- Degree of Pain: moderate or mild
||--- Abdominal Distension: slight or none
|||--- Nasogastric Reflux: <1 liter or none
||||--- Rectal Examination Findings: increased or decreased
|||||--- class: surgical

|--- Degree of Pain: moderate or mild
||--- Abdominal Distension: slight or none
|||--- Nasogastric Reflux: <1 liter or none
||||--- Rectal Examination Findings: normal
|||||--- Abdominocentesis Appearance: serosanguinous
||||||--- class: surgical

|--- Degree of Pain: moderate or mild
||--- Abdominal Distension: slight or none
|||--- Nasogastric Reflux: <1 liter or none
||||--- Rectal Examination Findings: normal
|||||--- Abdominocentesis Appearance: clear or cloudy
||||||--- class: non-surgical

This decision tree suggests that horses with severe pain, severe abdominal distension, significant nasogastric reflux, abnormal rectal examination findings, or serosanguinous abdominocentesis appearance are more likely to require surgical intervention.

Please note that this is a simplified example and may not reflect the actual relationships between the features and the outcome in real-world data. A more accurate decision tree would require a larger dataset and potentially additional feature selection techniques.

Here is a Python function that represents the decision tree for predicting whether a horse colic lesion requires surgery or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a horse colic lesion requires surgery or not.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the features of the horse.
            The keys should be the feature names, and the values should be the corresponding feature values.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes.
            The prediction is 0 if surgery is not required, and 1 if surgery is required.
            The truth values are represented as a list of integers (0 or 1), where 1 indicates that the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied.

    Raises:
        KeyError: If any of the required features are missing from the input dictionary.
    """

    # Initialize the nodes array to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 6 * [None]

    # Node 0: rectal_temperature > 38.5
    nodes[0] = X["rectal_temperature"] > 38.5

    # Node 1: pulse > 60
    nodes[1] = X["pulse"] > 60

    # Node 2: pain == 2 (continuous severe pain)
    nodes[2] = X["pain"] == 2

    # Node 3: abdominal_distension == 3 (severe)
    nodes[3] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 3

    # Node 4: nasogastric_reflux_PH < 5
    nodes[4] = X["nasogastric_reflux_PH"] < 5

    # Node 5: packed_cell_volume < 25
    nodes[5] = X["packed_cell_volume"] < 25

    # Start making predictions based on the node values
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[5]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

You can use this function by passing in a dictionary containing the feature values of the horse. For example:

```python
X = {
    "rectal_temperature": 39.2,
    "pulse": 70,
    "pain": 2,
    "abdominal_distension": 3,
    "nasogastric_reflux_PH": 4.5,
    "packed_cell_volume": 20
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

This will output the predicted value (0 or 1) and the truth values of the inner nodes (a list of integers).
