Based on the features provided, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not. Here's the resulting tree:

|--- Nasogastric Reflux (>1 liter)
||--- class: Surgical
|--- Nasogastric Reflux (none / <1 liter)
||--- Abdominal Distension (moderate / severe)
|||--- class: Surgical
||--- Abdominal Distension (none / slight)
|||--- Degree of Pain (severe)
||||--- class: Surgical
||||--- Degree of Pain (none / mild / moderate)
|||||--- Rectal Examination Findings (increased / absent)
||||||--- class: Medical
||||||--- Rectal Examination Findings (normal / decreased)
|||||||--- class: Medical

This decision tree uses the following features to predict whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not:

1. **Nasogastric Reflux**: If the reflux is greater than 1 liter, it's likely that the lesion is surgical.
2. **Abdominal Distension**: If the distension is moderate or severe, and the nasogastric reflux is not greater than 1 liter, then it's likely that the lesion is surgical.
3. **Degree of Pain**: If the pain is severe, and the abdominal distension is not moderate or severe, then it's likely that the lesion is surgical.
4. **Rectal Examination Findings**: If the rectal examination findings are increased or absent, and none of the above conditions are met, then it's likely that the lesion is medical.

Note that this decision tree is based on a simplified analysis and may not capture all possible interactions between features. In practice, you would want to validate this model using additional data and consider consulting with equine veterinary experts to ensure that the predictions align with clinical judgment.

Here are some explanations for the selected features:

* **Nasogastric Reflux**: A large amount of reflux can indicate a blockage or obstruction in the digestive tract, which often requires surgical intervention.
* **Abdominal Distension**: Moderate to severe distension can be a sign of a serious underlying condition, such as a bowel rupture or torsion, that may require surgery.
* **Degree of Pain**: Severe pain is often associated with conditions that require surgical intervention, such as a perforated intestine or a twisted bowel.
* **Rectal Examination Findings**: Abnormal rectal examination findings can indicate a range of underlying issues, from inflammation to obstruction. In this case, increased or absent findings are used to distinguish between medical and surgical cases.

Keep in mind that this decision tree is not meant to replace expert clinical judgment but rather to provide a starting point for further analysis and discussion.

Here is the decision tree implemented as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0
    nodes[1] = (X["abdominal_distension"] == 3) or (X["abdominal_distension"] == 1)
    nodes[2] = X["pain"] == 5
    nodes[3] = (X["rectal_examination"] == 1) or (X["rectal_examination"] == 2)

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0
                else:
                    prediction = 0

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

In this implementation, I've used the provided feature names and encodings. The decision tree first checks if there is more than 1 liter of nasogastric reflux (node[0]). If true, it predicts a surgical case. Otherwise, it checks if there is moderate or severe abdominal distension (node[1]), and if so, also predicts a surgical case. Then, it checks for severe pain (node[2]) and again predicts a surgical case if present. Finally, it checks the rectal examination findings (node[3]), predicting a non-surgical case if decreased or absent.

Note that I've used integer encoding for the boolean values in the nodes list (`int(node)`) to match the required output format.
