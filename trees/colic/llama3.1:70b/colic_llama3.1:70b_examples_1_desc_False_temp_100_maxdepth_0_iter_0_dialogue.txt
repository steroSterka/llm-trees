Based on the features you provided, I will induce a decision tree classifier to predict whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not. 

To simplify the problem, I'll consider "surgery" as the target variable with two classes: yes (surgical) and no (non-surgical). The other features will be used to construct the decision tree.

Here's the induced decision tree:

|--- Nasogastric Reflux (none / >1 liter / <1 liter) == significant
||--- class: surgical (yes)
|--- Nasogastric Reflux (none / >1 liter / <1 liter) != significant
||--- Abdominocentesis Appearance (clear / cloudy / serosanguinous) == serosanguinous
|||--- class: surgical (yes)
||--- Abdominocentesis Appearance (clear / cloudy / serosanguinous) != serosanguinous
||||--- Degree of Pain (none / mild / moderate / severe) == severe
|||||--- class: surgical (yes)
||||--- Degree of Pain (none / mild / moderate / severe) != severe
||||||--- Rectal Examination Findings (normal / increased / descreased / absent) == abnormal (increased or decreased)
|||||||--- class: surgical (yes)
||||||--- Rectal Examination Findings (normal / increased / descreased / absent) == normal
||||||||--- class: non-surgical (no)

The decision tree uses the following features to classify whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not:

1. Nasogastric Reflux: significant reflux (>1 liter or <1 liter) indicates a high likelihood of surgery.
2. Abdominocentesis Appearance: serosanguinous fluid appearance suggests surgery.
3. Degree of Pain: severe pain is associated with a higher likelihood of surgery.
4. Rectal Examination Findings: abnormal rectal examination findings (increased or decreased) indicate a higher likelihood of surgery.

Note that this decision tree is based on the features you provided and may not be an optimal solution. The performance of the model can be improved by considering additional features, data preprocessing, or more advanced machine learning techniques.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Nasogastric Reflux (more than 1 liter)
    nodes[0] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0
    
    # Node 1: Abdominocentesis Appearance (serosanguinous)
    nodes[1] = X["abdominocentesis_appearance"] == 3
    
    # Node 2: Rectal Examination Findings (absent or decreased)
    nodes[2] = X["rectal_examination"] in [1, 2]
    
    # Node 3: Nasogastric Tube (significant)
    nodes[3] = X["nasogastric_tube"] == 2
    
    # Node 4: Abdominocentesis Total Protein (high)
    nodes[4] = X["abdomcentesis_total_protein"] > 5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    elif nodes[3]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[1]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
                
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, which contains the feature values for the horse colic lesion. The function evaluates the decision tree and returns a tuple containing the predicted target variable value (`prediction`) and the values of the internal nodes (`nodes`).
