Based on the features you provided, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not. After analyzing the features, I've selected the most important ones to build the tree.

**Selected Features:**

1. Degree of Pain (none / mild / moderate / severe)
2. Abdominal Distension (none / slight / moderate / severe)
3. Nasogastric Tube (none / slight / significant)
4. Nasogastric Reflux pH
5. Rectal Examination Findings (normal / increased / decreased / absent)
6. Packed Cell Volume (%)

**Decision Tree:**

|--- Degree of Pain = severe
||--- class: surgical

|--- Degree of Pain != severe
||--- Abdominal Distension = severe
|||--- class: surgical

||--- Abdominal Distension != severe
||||--- Nasogastric Tube = significant
|||||--- class: surgical

||||--- Nasogastric Tube != significant
||||||--- Rectal Examination Findings = absent
|||||||--- class: surgical

||||||--- Rectal Examination Findings != absent
||||||||--- Packed Cell Volume (%) <= 25
|||||||||--- class: non-surgical

||||||||--- Packed Cell Volume (%) > 25
|||||||||--- Nasogastric Reflux pH <= 4
||||||||||--- class: surgical

||||||||||--- Nasogastric Reflux pH > 4
|||||||||||--- class: non-surgical

**Explanation:**

The decision tree starts by checking the Degree of Pain. If it's severe, the lesion is likely to be surgical.

If the pain is not severe, the tree checks for Abdominal Distension. If it's severe, the lesion is also likely to be surgical.

If abdominal distension is not severe, the tree examines the Nasogastric Tube. If it's significant, the lesion is likely to be surgical.

The next checks are for Rectal Examination Findings and Packed Cell Volume (%). These features help determine whether the lesion is non-surgical or surgical.

Finally, the tree checks the Nasogastric Reflux pH to further refine the classification.

**Note:**

Please keep in mind that this decision tree is induced based on a limited number of features and may not reflect the complexity of real-world data. In practice, you may want to consider more features, handle missing values, and validate the performance of the model using techniques like cross-validation.

Here is the decision tree as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 8 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Degree of Pain = severe (continuous severe pain, intermittent severe pain)
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]

    # Node 1: Abdominal Distension = severe
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 3

    # Node 2: Nasogastric Tube = significant
    nodes[2] = X["nasogastric_tube"] == 2

    # Node 3: Rectal Examination Findings = absent
    nodes[3] = X["rectal_examination"] == 1

    # Node 4: Packed Cell Volume (%) <= 25
    nodes[4] = X["packed_cell_volume"] <= 25

    # Node 5: Nasogastric Reflux pH <= 4
    nodes[5] = X["nasogastric_reflux_PH"] <= 4

    # Node 6: Abdominal Distension != severe and Degree of Pain is not severe (intermittent mild pain, depressed)
    nodes[6] = X["abdominal_distension"] != 3 and X["pain"] in [1, 3, 4]

    # Node 7: Nasogastric Tube is not significant and Rectal Examination Findings is not absent
    nodes[7] = X["nasogastric_tube"] != 2 and X["rectal_examination"] != 1

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    elif nodes[6]:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1
            elif nodes[7]:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    if nodes[5]:
                        prediction = 1
                    else:
                        prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 0

    # Convert boolean values to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

You can use the function like this:

```python
X = {
    "pain": 5,
    "abdominal_distension": 2,
    "nasogastric_tube": 1,
    "rectal_examination": 4,
    "packed_cell_volume": 30,
    "nasogastric_reflux_PH": 6
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```
