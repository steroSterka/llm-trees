Based on the provided features, I will build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 to classify whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not. After analyzing the features, I selected the most important ones for the decision tree:

**Selected Features:**

1. **Nasogastric Reflux (>1 liter / <1 liter)**
2. **Abdominal Distension (none / slight / moderate / severe)**

Here is the induced decision tree:
```
|--- Nasogastric Reflux <= 1 liter
||--- Abdominal Distension <= slight
|||--- class: non-surgical
||--- Abdominal Distension > slight
|||--- class: surgical
|--- Nasogastric Reflux > 1 liter
||--- class: surgical
```
In this decision tree:

* If the nasogastric reflux is less than or equal to 1 liter and abdominal distension is slight or none, the lesion is likely non-surgical.
* If the nasogastric reflux is greater than 1 liter, the lesion is likely surgical, regardless of the abdominal distension level.
* If the nasogastric reflux is less than or equal to 1 liter but abdominal distension is moderate or severe, the lesion is also likely surgical.

Note that this decision tree has a maximum depth of 2 and uses only two features: Nasogastric Reflux and Abdominal Distension. These features are selected based on their importance in determining whether a horse colic lesion requires surgery.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting whether a horse colic lesion requires surgery or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 1  # less than 1 liter
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 3  # slight or none
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # surgical
    else:
        prediction = 1  # surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

In this function:

* The input `X` is a dictionary containing the feature values.
* We create two inner node truth values (`nodes`) to track whether each condition is satisfied (True) or not (False).
* The first condition checks if the nasogastric reflux is less than 1 liter (encoded as 1). If true, we proceed to check the abdominal distension level.
* If the abdominal distension is slight or none (encoded as <= 3), we predict non-surgical. Otherwise, we predict surgical.
* If the nasogastric reflux is greater than 1 liter (or missing/unknown), we directly predict surgical.

The function returns a tuple containing:

1. The predicted class label (`prediction`): 0 for non-surgical and 1 for surgical.
2. A list of truth values representing the inner nodes (`nodes`): [True/False, True/False].
