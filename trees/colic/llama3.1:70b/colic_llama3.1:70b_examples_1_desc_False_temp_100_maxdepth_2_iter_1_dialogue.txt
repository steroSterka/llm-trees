Based on the features you provided, I'll induce a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 to classify whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not. Please note that the importance of features might vary based on the actual data distribution and relationships between features.

After analyzing the features, I've selected the most important ones for the decision tree:

1. Nasogastric Reflux (>1 liter / <1 liter) - This feature indicates the amount of reflux, which can be a critical indicator of colic severity.
2. Abdominal Distension (none / slight / moderate / severe) - The level of distension can indicate the severity of colic and potential need for surgery.

Here's the decision tree:
```
|--- Nasogastric Reflux > 1 liter
||--- class: surgical
|--- Nasogastric Reflux <= 1 liter
||--- Abdominal Distension <= moderate
|||--- class: non-surgical
||--- Abdominal Distension > moderate
|||--- class: surgical
```
In this decision tree:

* If the nasogastric reflux is greater than 1 liter, the lesion is likely to be surgical.
* If the nasogastric reflux is less than or equal to 1 liter, we consider the abdominal distension level:
	+ If the distension is moderate or less, the lesion is likely non-surgical.
	+ If the distension is severe, the lesion is likely surgical.

Keep in mind that this decision tree is a simplified representation and may not capture all complexities of the data. In practice, you would want to validate this model using techniques like cross-validation and evaluate its performance on unseen data. Additionally, incorporating more features or increasing the tree depth might improve the accuracy of the classifier.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 1  # Nasogastric Reflux <= 1 liter
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 3  # Abdominal Distension <= moderate

    if not nodes[0]:  # If nasogastric reflux is more than 1 liter
        prediction = 1  # surgery
    else:  # Nasogastric Reflux <= 1 liter
        if not nodes[1]:  # Abdominal distension > moderate
            prediction = 1  # surgery
        else:
            prediction = 0  # non-surgery

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

In this function, we use the `nasogastric_reflux` and `abdominal_distension` features to make predictions. We assign a value of 1 to `nodes[0]` if the nasogastric reflux is less than or equal to 1 liter, and a value of 1 to `nodes[1]` if the abdominal distension is moderate or less. The prediction logic follows the decision tree rules.

Note that we convert the boolean values in the `nodes` list to integers using a list comprehension before returning them, so they match the format specified in your example.
