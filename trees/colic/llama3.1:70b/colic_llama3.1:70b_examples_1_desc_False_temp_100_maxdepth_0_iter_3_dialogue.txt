Based on the provided features, I will attempt to build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not. 

After analyzing the features, I have selected the top 5 most important ones based on their potential impact on the outcome:

1. Degree of Pain (none / mild / moderate / severe)
2. Nasogastric Reflux (>1 liter / <1 liter / none)
3. Abdominal Distension (none / slight / moderate / severe)
4. Rectal Examination Findings (normal / increased / decreased / absent)
5. Abdominocentesis Appearance (clear / cloudy / serosanguinous)

Here is the decision tree:

|--- Degree of Pain <= mild
||--- class: non-surgical
|--- Degree of Pain > mild
||--- Nasogastric Reflux > 1 liter
|||--- class: surgical
||--- Nasogastric Reflux <= 1 liter
|||--- Abdominal Distension >= moderate
||||--- class: surgical
||||--- Abdominal Distension < moderate
|||||--- Rectal Examination Findings == decreased or absent
||||||--- class: surgical
||||||--- Rectal Examination Findings == normal or increased
|||||||--- Abdominocentesis Appearance == serosanguinous
||||||||--- class: surgical
||||||||--- Abdominocentesis Appearance != serosanguinous
|||||||||--- class: non-surgical

Note that this decision tree is not exhaustive, and there may be other important features or interactions between them. Additionally, the accuracy of the tree depends on the quality of the data used to train it.

Please provide me with more information about the dataset, such as the number of samples, the distribution of surgical vs non-surgical cases, and any specific requirements for the decision tree (e.g., maximum depth or complexity). This will help me refine the model.

Here's a function that implements the decision tree based on the provided features:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Degree of Pain <= moderate
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [1, 2, 3, 4]  # Alert, continuous severe pain, depressed, intermittent mild pain
    
    # Nasogastric Reflux > 1 liter
    nodes[1] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0  # More than 1 liter
    
    # Abdominal Distension >= moderate
    nodes[2] = X["abdominal_distension"] in [1, 3]  # Moderate or severe
    
    # Rectal Examination Findings == decreased or absent
    nodes[3] = X["rectal_examination"] in [1, 2]  # Absent or decreased
    
    # Abdominocentesis Appearance == serosanguinous
    nodes[4] = X["abdominocentesis_appearance"] == 3  # Serosanguinous

    if not nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
    elif nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1  # Surgical
    elif nodes[2]:
        prediction = 1  # Surgical
    elif nodes[3] or nodes[4]:
        prediction = 1  # Surgical
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Non-surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```
This function takes a dictionary `X` with the provided features and returns a tuple containing the predicted target value (0 for non-surgical and 1 for surgical) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree. 

Please note that I've encoded the categorical variables according to their descriptions, assuming that the encoding is 0-based. Also, the feature "pain" has multiple categories that correspond to moderate pain or less, so I've combined them into a single condition for simplicity.
