Based on the provided features, I will build a decision tree to classify whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not. Since there are many features and some of them have multiple categories, I'll try to simplify the tree by selecting the most important ones.

Here's my attempt at building a decision tree:

**Decision Tree:**

|--- Nasogastric Reflux (none / >1 liter / <1 liter)
||--- Nasogastric Reflux <= 1 liter
|||--- Degree of Pain (none / mild / moderate / severe) == severe
||||--- class: surgical
|||--- Degree of Pain != severe
||||--- Abdominocentesis Appearance (clear / cloudy / serosanguinous) == serosanguinous
|||||--- class: surgical
|||||--- Abdominocentesis Appearance != serosanguinous
||||||--- Nasogastric Tube (none / slight / significant) == significant
|||||||--- class: surgical
|||||||--- Nasogastric Tube != significant
||||||||--- class: non-surgical
||--- Nasogastric Reflux > 1 liter
|||--- class: surgical

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* The first feature is Nasogastric Reflux, which helps to identify horses with severe colic symptoms.
* If the reflux is less than or equal to 1 liter, we check the Degree of Pain. If it's severe, the horse is likely to require surgery.
* If the pain is not severe, we examine the Abdominocentesis Appearance. If it's serosanguinous (indicating blood in the fluid), surgery is likely necessary.
* If the appearance is not serosanguinous, we consider the Nasogastric Tube. A significant amount of reflux indicates a higher likelihood of requiring surgery.
* If none of these conditions are met, the horse is classified as non-surgical.

Note that this decision tree is a simplification and may not capture all possible scenarios or interactions between features. In practice, you would need to validate the performance of this tree using a separate dataset and consider incorporating additional features or more complex relationships.

Please let me know if you'd like me to revise or expand on this decision tree!

Here is the Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Nasogastric Reflux > 1 liter
    nodes[0] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0
    
    # Degree of Pain is severe (5 = intermittent severe pain)
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] == 5
    
    # Abdominocentesis Appearance is serosanguinous
    nodes[2] = X["abdominocentesis_appearance"] == 3
    
    # Nasogastric Tube is significant (2 = significant)
    nodes[3] = X["nasogastric_tube"] == 2
    
    # Nasogastric Reflux <= 1 liter
    nodes[4] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 1

    if not nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        elif nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1
        elif nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    # Convert boolean values to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function uses the decision tree that I previously created. The `nodes` list stores the truth values of each inner node in the decision tree, and the `prediction` variable stores the final classification (1 if surgery is required, 0 otherwise).
