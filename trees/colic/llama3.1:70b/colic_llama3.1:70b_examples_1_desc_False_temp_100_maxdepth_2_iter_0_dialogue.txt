Based on the features you provided, I will build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not. Since there are many features, I will use a feature selection method to select the most important ones.

After analyzing the data, I selected the following top 5 features based on their importance:

1. Nasogastric Reflux (>1 liter / <1 liter)
2. Abdominal Distension (none / slight / moderate / severe)
3. Degree of Pain (none / mild / moderate / severe)
4. Rectal Examination Findings (normal / increased / descreased / absent)
5. Pulse (beats per minute)

Here is the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2:

|--- Nasogastric Reflux >1 liter
||--- class: surgical
|--- Nasogastric Reflux <=1 liter
||--- Abdominal Distension > slight
|||--- class: surgical
||--- Abdominal Distension <= slight
|||--- Degree of Pain > mild
||||--- class: surgical
||||--- class: non-surgical

The decision tree suggests that if the Nasogastric Reflux is more than 1 liter, the lesion is likely to be surgical. If not, then the abdominal distension and degree of pain are considered. If the abdominal distension is moderate or severe, or the degree of pain is moderate or severe, the lesion is also likely to be surgical.

Please note that this decision tree is a simplification and may not capture all the complexities of the data. Additionally, the importance of features may vary depending on the specific dataset and problem.

Here is the decision tree as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3
    
    # Nasogastric Reflux >1 liter
    nodes[0] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0
    
    # Abdominal Distension > slight
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] in [3, 4]
    
    # Degree of Pain > mild
    nodes[2] = X["pain"] in [5, 6]
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    elif nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

In this implementation, the `predict` function takes a dictionary `X` with features as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted target variable (surgery or not) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

Note that I used the exact keys from your feature list to ensure correctness. Also, I filled in meaningful threshold values based on the provided descriptions. If these thresholds need to be adjusted, you can modify them accordingly.

The function uses the decision tree logic as described earlier:

1. If Nasogastric Reflux is more than 1 liter (`nasogastric_reflux == 0`), predict surgery (1).
2. Otherwise, if Abdominal Distension is greater than slight (`abdominal_distension in [3, 4]`), predict surgery (1).
3. If neither of the above conditions are true, check Degree of Pain: if it's more severe than mild (`pain in [5, 6]`), predict surgery (1); otherwise, predict no surgery (0).

Please let me know if you need further modifications!
