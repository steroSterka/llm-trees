Okay, so I need to build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 to classify whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not. The features provided are quite a lot, but I need to pick the most important ones. Let me start by recalling how decision trees work. They split the data based on features that best separate the classes, and each split reduces impurity. Since the maximum depth is 2, the tree can have at most two splits from the root.

First, I should figure out which features are the most important. The problem mentions using the "most important features," so I might need to think about which of the given features are known to be significant in determining whether colic requires surgery. Alternatively, if I don't have domain knowledge, I might have to make an educated guess based on common medical knowledge.

Looking at the features:

- surgery (yes/no) – but wait, that's actually the target variable we're trying to predict. Because the outcome is "Outcome (lived / died / euthanized)", maybe "surgery" is part of the outcome? Wait, the original problem says "classify whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not." So perhaps "surgery" is the target variable? Wait, the first example used features like petal width, which were features, and the target was the class (setosa etc). In this case, the target here is whether the colic is surgical (needs surgery) or not. So "surgery" is the target variable, which is given as "yes/no". Wait, but in the features list, "surgery" is listed as a feature. That's a problem because if surgery is part of the features, then we can't use it to predict surgery. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe there was a misunderstanding. Let me check again.

The user says: "classify whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not." So the target variable is "surgical" (yes/no). But in the features list, "surgery" is listed as a feature, with possible values yes/no. That must be a mistake, because the target can't be part of the features. Alternatively, maybe "surgery" is actually the outcome, but the user wants to predict whether the lesion is surgical (i.e., whether surgery is needed). So perhaps "surgery" is the target variable, but it's listed as a feature here. That would be conflicting. Hmm. Wait, looking at the user's example, the features were sepal length, etc., and the target was the class (setosa, etc.), which wasn't listed as a feature. So in the problem here, the target is "surgical or not", but the features include "surgery (yes/no)". That seems conflicting. Maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps "surgery" is not part of the features. Alternatively, maybe the Outcome is the target? Let me check the problem again.

Wait, the problem says: "classify whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not." So the target variable is "surgical" (yes/no). But in the features provided, there is a "surgery (yes/no)" feature. That would mean that the feature includes information about whether surgery was performed. If that's the case, we can't use that feature to predict the target because it's the outcome itself. That would be circular. So there's likely a confusion here. Alternatively, maybe the Outcome is the target? The features include "Outcome (lived / died / euthanized)". But the user's task is to predict "surgical" status, so maybe "surgery" is the target variable, but it's listed as a feature. That must be an error. Alternatively, perhaps the "surgery" in the features is a different variable, such as whether surgery was attempted, but the target is whether it was needed. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the Horse Colic dataset, which is a known dataset. Let me recall that in the Horse Colic dataset, the target variable is the outcome (e.g., whether the horse lived or died), but here the user wants to predict if the colic is surgical (i.e., required surgery). Maybe in that dataset, the "Surgery" column indicates whether the horse underwent surgery, which could be the target variable here. But then, the features would include the other variables. However, if "surgery" is the target, then it can't be a feature. Therefore, the user probably made a mistake in listing "surgery" as a feature. Let me check the features again. The features list starts with "surgery (yes / no)", but if that's the target, then it shouldn't be part of the features. Alternatively, maybe "surgery" is part of the features but not the target. But the problem says to classify whether the colic is surgical, which would be the surgery outcome. So perhaps the "Outcome" is different, and "surgery" is indeed the target. Therefore, the first feature in the list is actually the target. That's a problem. 

Alternatively, maybe the user intended that "surgery" is part of the features, but the target is "Outcome", which includes "euthanized" which might relate to whether surgery was done. Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the features list, and "surgery" is the target, not a feature. Let me proceed under the assumption that "surgery" is the target variable, and the features are the rest. The user might have accidentally included it in the features. So I need to build a decision tree to predict "surgery" (yes/no) based on the other features. 

Alternatively, maybe "Outcome" is the target. The user says "classify whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not," so perhaps the target is whether surgery was performed (surgery: yes/no), so that is the target variable. Therefore, the feature list includes "surgery" by mistake. So to proceed, I will exclude "surgery" from the features and treat it as the target variable. So the features are all the other ones except "surgery" and "Outcome". Wait, but "Outcome" has categories like lived, died, euthanized. Maybe the user wants to predict "Outcome" but the question states surgical or not. Hmm, this is a problem. Alternatively, perhaps "surgery" is part of the features, and the target is inferred from the outcome. Maybe "surgery" is part of the features, and the target is "Outcome", but the user wants to predict if the lesion was surgical (maybe based on outcome like euthanized or died requiring surgery). Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and the "surgery" is the target variable. Let me try to proceed by assuming that the target variable is "surgery" (yes/no) and the features are all the other variables except "surgery". That makes sense because otherwise the problem is impossible. So I'll proceed with that.

Now, the features to consider are:

Age (adult/young), Rectal Temperature (°C), Pulse (beats per minute), Respiratory Rate (breaths per minute), Temperature of Extremities (normal / warm / cool / cold), Strength of Peripheral Pulse (normal / increased / reduced / absent), Appearance of Mucous Membranes (normal pink / bright pink / pale pink / pale cyanotic / bright red / dark cyanotic), Capillary Refill Time (< 3 seconds /  >= 3 seconds), Degree of Pain (none / mild / moderate / severe), peristalsis (hypermotile / normal / hypomotile / absent), Abdominal Distension (none / slight / moderate / severe), Nasogastric Tube (none / slight / significant), Nasogastric Reflux (none / >1 liter / <1 liter), Nasogastric Reflux pH, Rectal Examination Findings (normal / increased / decreased / absent), Abdomen Appearance (normal / other / feces in the large intestine / distended small intestine / distended large intestine), Packed Cell Volume (%), Total Protein (g/dl), Abdominocentesis Appearance (clear / cloudy / serosanguinous), Abdominocentesis Total Protein (g/dl).

Wait, also "Outcome (lived / died / euthanized)" is listed as a feature? That can't be, since outcome is probably the result, but the user wants to predict surgical status, so perhaps that's part of the features? Not sure. Maybe the user intended that the target is "Outcome", but the question states "surgical or not", so perhaps the target is "surgery". Let me proceed under the assumption that "surgery" is the target, so exclude it from the features. Also, "Outcome" might be a dependent variable, so exclude it as well. Therefore the features are the remaining.

Now, the next step is to select the most important features to build a decision tree with maximum depth 2. Since I don't have the actual data, I need to rely on medical knowledge or common features that predict the need for surgery in colic cases.

From medical knowledge, factors that might indicate the need for surgery in horses with colic include:

- Increased heart rate (high pulse)
- Distended abdomen
- Absent gut sounds (peristalsis)
- High packed cell volume (dehydration)
- Elevated total protein
- Abdominal distension
- Pain level (severe)
- Mucous membrane color (like pale pink, cyanotic, etc., indicating shock)
- Capillary refill time (>=3 seconds indicates poor perfusion)
- Nasogastric reflux (significant reflux suggests obstruction)
- Abdominocentesis findings (like cloudy or high protein indicating peritonitis)
- Rectal exam findings (like absence of intestinal contents)
- Abdomen appearance (distended small intestine suggests obstruction)

So these are potential important features.

Since the decision tree depth is 2, we need two levels of splits. The root node will split on the most important feature, and each of its children will split on the next important features.

First, choose the root feature. Let's think: which single feature gives the best split? Maybe pulse rate (high pulse is a sign of pain or shock, indicating possible need for surgery). Alternatively, peristalsis (absent gut sounds might indicate intestinal obstruction, needing surgery). Or abdominal distension. Let's see.

Suppose the first split is on "Pulse (beats per minute)". If pulse is above a certain threshold (say, 60 bpm?), maybe that indicates the need for surgery.

Alternatively, "Degree of Pain (severe)" could be a strong indicator. If pain is severe, surgery might be more likely.

Alternatively, "Abdominal Distension (severe)".

Alternatively, "Packed Cell Volume (%)", high PCV indicates dehydration, which might require surgery.

Alternatively, "peristalsis (absent)" is a strong indicator for surgery needed.

Given that peristalsis being absent is a critical sign, maybe that's the root.

So let's think of peristalsis first:

Root: peristalsis = absent? If yes, then likely surgical. If not absent, then maybe next feature.

Alternatively, if the first split is on peristalsis (hypermotile, normal, hypomotile, absent). The most critical is "absent". So the split could be peristalsis = absent vs not absent. If absent, then surgery is needed. If present (any of hypermotile, normal, hypomotile), then split again on another feature.

Alternatively, maybe the root is "Degree of Pain". If severe pain, then surgery is needed. But pain can be managed without surgery, so maybe not as decisive.

Alternatively, let's think of features that have a clear threshold. For numeric features like Pulse or PCV, they can be split at a threshold. For categorical features like peristalsis, the split is on categories.

Suppose the first split is on peristalsis:

|--- peristalsis = absent
||--- class: yes (surgery needed)
|--- peristalsis != absent
||--- split on another feature, e.g., abdominal distension.

Wait but the max depth is 2, so the second level can have two branches again. For example, after splitting on peristalsis, the next split could be on Abdominal Distension. So:

Root: peristalsis = absent? If yes, surgery yes. If no, then split on Abdominal Distension. For example, if abdominal distension is severe, then surgery yes; else, maybe surgery no. But need to see how the splits work.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Packed Cell Volume. Suppose PCV > 45% indicates dehydration, leading to surgery. If yes, then split on another feature. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the first split could be on Capillary Refill Time (>=3 seconds) which indicates poor perfusion, requiring surgery.

Alternatively, the first split could be on Nasogastric Reflux (significant), which suggests obstruction.

Hmm, this is tricky without data. Let me try to think of the most critical features in colic cases:

- Absence of gut sounds (peristalsis = absent) is a strong indicator for surgery.
- Severe pain.
- Abdominal distension.
- Capillary refill time prolonged.
- High PCV.

Alternatively, according to some sources, the most important factors are heart rate (pulse), peristalsis, mucous membrane color, and pain level.

Let me try to proceed step by step.

First, choose the root node feature. Let's pick peristalsis as the root. The split would be:

Root: peristalsis = absent? If yes, then surgery is likely. If not, proceed to next split.

Now, the second level (max depth 2) would be a split on another feature for each branch.

For the branch where peristalsis is absent, maybe surgery is yes. For the branch where peristalsis is present (hypermotile, normal, hypomotile), we need another split. Let's choose another important feature, like Degree of Pain.

So:

|--- peristalsis = absent
||--- class: yes (surgery)
|--- peristalsis != absent
||--- Degree of Pain: severe?
|||--- yes: surgery yes
|||--- no: surgery no

But this is depth 2.

Alternatively, maybe instead of degree of pain, another feature like Packed Cell Volume.

Alternatively, for the second split on the right branch (peristalsis not absent), use Abdominal Distension.

So:

|--- peristalsis = absent
||--- class: yes (surgery)
|--- peristalsis != absent
||--- Abdominal Distension >= moderate?
|||--- yes: surgery yes
|||--- no: surgery no

Alternatively, if the first split is on pulse (beats per minute), say if pulse > 60, then split on something else.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Capillary Refill Time. If CRT >=3 seconds, then surgery yes. Else, split on another feature.

Hmm. To make a decision, perhaps the most critical is peristalsis. Let me proceed with that.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Nasogastric Reflux. If the reflux is >1 liter, that's a sign of obstruction, requiring surgery. But the categories are none, >1 liter, <1 liter. So maybe split into "significant reflux" (like >1 liter) vs others.

Alternatively, the first split on Abdominal Distension. If severe, surgery yes.

But I think peristalsis is more critical. Let me go with that.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on "Rectal Examination Findings" like absence of intestinal contents, but that's part of the rectal exam.

Alternatively, given that peristalsis and abdominal distension are common factors, let's try:

Root: peristalsis = absent? (if yes, surgery yes)

Then, if peristalsis is present, split on Abdominal Distension (severe? then surgery yes, else no).

Alternatively, let's make the second split on Degree of Pain (severe).

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on Packed Cell Volume. Suppose PCV > 45% indicates dehydration, so then surgery yes.

Alternatively, let me think of another approach. Since the maximum depth is 2, the tree will have three levels: root, two children, and each of those can have two leaves. So each path from root to leaf has at most two splits.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on "Degree of Pain". If severe, then surgery yes. Else, split on peristalsis.

So:

Root: Degree of Pain is severe?

|--- yes: surgery yes
|--- no:
||--- peristalsis = absent? yes -> surgery yes; no -> surgery no

But that's also depth 2.

Alternatively, first split on Packed Cell Volume (e.g., PCV >45%):

Root: PCV >45?

|--- yes: surgery yes
|--- no: split on peristalsis (absent?)

||--- peristalsis absent -> yes

||--- else -> no

Hmm, that could be.

Alternatively, the first split on Pulse:

Root: Pulse > 60 bpm?

|--- yes: split on peristalsis (absent?) then yes/no

|--- no: split on something else?

Wait, but with max depth 2, after first split, each child can have their own split.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on "Abdomen Appearance" having distended small intestine (which is a critical sign):

Root: Abdomen Appearance = distended small intestine?

|--- yes: surgery yes

|--- no: split on peristalsis (absent?)

||--- yes -> surgery yes

||--- no -> surgery no

This also works.

However, since I need to pick features that are likely to be the most important, and without data, I might have to proceed with the most common critical factors.

Another approach: In veterinary medicine, the decision to operate for colic often hinges on the presence of severe pain, absence of gut sounds, distended abdomen, and certain lab values.

Given that, let's structure the tree as follows:

Root split on peristalsis (absent vs present).

If absent, surgery is needed (yes).

If present, then split on Abdominal Distension (severe vs not severe).

If Abdominal Distension is severe, then surgery yes; else, surgery no.

This would give:

|--- peristalsis = absent -> yes

|--- peristalsis != absent

||--- abdominal_distension = severe -> yes

||--- abdominal_distension != severe -> no

Alternatively, maybe instead of abdominal distension, use Degree of Pain:

If peristalsis is present, then check if pain is severe. If yes, then surgery yes; else, no.

This would be:

|--- peristalsis_absent -> yes

|--- peristalsis_not_absent

||--- pain_severe -> yes

||--- pain_not_severe -> no

This is also depth 2 and plausible.

Alternatively, using numeric features like PCV:

Root: peristalsis_absent -> yes

Else, split on PCV >45%:

||--- PCV >45% -> yes

||--- else -> no

This would mean if PCV is high (dehydration), then surgery even if peristalsis is present.

But I'm not sure if PCV is as critical as abdominal distension or pain.

Alternatively, combining peristalsis and pain.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on the presence of severe pain and peristalsis absent.

Alternatively, let me think of another angle. Suppose the first split is on "Nasogastric Reflux". If there's significant reflux (e.g., >1 liter), that indicates obstruction, so surgery yes. If not, then split on peristalsis.

But I'm not sure if that's the most common.

Alternatively, maybe the first split on "Capillary Refill Time". If >=3 seconds, indicating shock, so surgery yes. Else, split on peristalsis.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on "Mucous Membrane Color", but that's not in the features listed. The features include Capillary Refill Time, which is related.

Given the features provided, perhaps the most logical first split is on peristalsis (absent), then on another critical feature like Abdominal Distension or Degree of Pain.

I think the most defensible decision would be:

Root: peristalsis_absent?

If yes, surgery yes.

If no, split on Abdominal_Distension_severe?

If yes, surgery yes; else surgery no.

This uses two important factors and stays within depth 2.

Alternatively, using Degree of Pain as the second split:

Root: peristalsis_absent?

Yes -> yes surgery.

No -> split on pain_severe?

Yes -> yes; else no.

This is also plausible.

Alternatively, if I consider that even if peristalsis is present, but pain is severe, surgery might be needed, but in some cases, pain can be managed medically.

Alternatively, maybe the second split should be on a lab value like PCV.

Let me try to pick the features that are most likely to be the top two important features.

Alternatively, looking up a study, but since I can't, I'll proceed with peristalsis and abdominal distension.

Therefore, the decision tree would be:

Root node: Peristalsis?

- If absent, then surgery is needed (yes).

- If present (hypermotile, normal, hypomotile), then split on Abdominal Distension.

   - If Abdominal Distension is severe, then surgery is needed (yes).

   - If not severe (none, slight, moderate?), then surgery not needed (no).

Alternatively, maybe split on "Abdominal Distension" into two categories: severe vs others.

Alternatively, the split might be on whether it's present or not. But the severity levels are none, slight, moderate, severe.

Alternatively, the split could be "Abdominal Distension >= moderate" vs less than that.

But to keep it simple, let's just use the presence of severe.

Alternatively, another approach:

Suppose the first split is on pulse rate. Suppose pulse > 60 bpm.

Then, if yes, split on peristalsis (absent) -> yes surgery.

Wait, but that may complicate.

Alternatively, the first split is on PCV: if PCV >45%.

Then:

- If yes, split on peristalsis absent -> yes.

But that might not be the best.

Alternatively, given the uncertainty, I'll go with peristalsis and abdominal distension as the two splits.

Thus, the decision tree would be structured as:

|--- peristalsis = absent -> surgery yes

|--- peristalsis != absent

||--- abdominal_distension = severe -> surgery yes

||--- abdominal_distension != severe -> surgery no

Alternatively, using Degree of Pain as the second split:

|--- peristalsis_absent -> yes

|--- peristalsis_not_absent

||--- pain_severe -> yes

||--- else -> no

Either way, both are plausible.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on "Degree of Pain". If severe, then surgery yes. If not, split on peristalsis.

This would also be depth 2:

Root: pain_severe?

|--- yes -> yes

|--- no:

||--- peristalsis_absent -> yes

||--- else -> no

This might be another option.

However, in clinical practice, the absence of gut sounds is a stronger indicator than pain level, since pain can be managed with analgesics, but absent gut sounds suggest a mechanical obstruction needing surgery.

Therefore, peristalsis is a better root node.

Hence, the final decision tree would be structured as follows:

Root: peristalsis = absent?

- If yes → surgery yes.

- If no → split on abdominal_distension = severe?

   - If yes → surgery yes.

   - If no → surgery no.

Alternatively, using Degree of Pain as the second split.

But let's pick abdominal distension.

Another consideration: Maybe if peristalsis is present but abdominal distension is severe, it's more likely to be a case of obstruction, requiring surgery.

Therefore, the decision tree would be as I outlined.

Alternatively, if abdominal distension is not severe but peristalsis is present, then maybe it's a medical colic, so surgery no.

Thus, the answer would be structured as such.
</think>

The decision tree for predicting the need for surgery in colic cases, structured with a maximum depth of 2 and based on critical clinical features, is as follows:

### Decision Tree Structure:
```
|--- **Root Node (Peristalsis):**  
    |--- **Peristalsis = Absent**  
        ||--- **Class:** Surgery **Yes** (Mechanical obstruction suspected).  
    |--- **Peristalsis ≠ Absent (Hypermotile, Normal, Hypomotile):**  
        ||--- **Split on Abdominal Distension:**  
            ||--- **Abdominal Distension = Severe**  
                |||--- **Class:** Surgery **Yes** (Obstruction or severe GI issue).  
            ||--- **Abdominal Distension ≠ Severe (None/Slight/Moderate):**  
                |||--- **Class:** Surgery **No** (Likely medical colic, manageable without surgery).  
```

### Key Rationale:
1. **Root Node (Peristalsis):**  
   Absence of gut sounds (peristalsis) is a critical indicator of mechanical obstruction (e.g., intestinal blockage), necessitating surgery. This is prioritized as the first split because it is a strong clinical sign of surgical intervention.

2. **Secondary Split (Abdominal Distension):**  
   If gut sounds are present but abdominal distension is severe, it suggests a severe gastrointestinal issue (e.g., dilation, torsion), warranting surgery. Moderate or mild distension may indicate a less urgent condition, such as spasmodic colic, which can often be managed medically.

### Interpretation:
- **Path 1:** If peristalsis is absent → **Surgery is required**.  
- **Path 2:** If peristalsis is present but abdominal distension is severe → **Surgery is required**.  
- **Path 3:** If peristalsis is present and abdominal distension is not severe → **Surgery is not needed** (medical management is likely sufficient).

This tree balances clinical urgency and practicality while adhering to a depth constraint of 2. It prioritizes clear, actionable indicators to guide surgical decisions in colic cases.

<think>
Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to create a Python function that represents a decision tree for predicting whether a horse's colic lesion requires surgery. The function should return a prediction and a list indicating which nodes were true (1) or false (0) along the path taken in the tree. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the decision tree. Wait, the user didn't provide the actual decision tree structure. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the user mentions "Here is the exact keys of the features" and other details, but the actual decision tree structure isn't given here. Oh, but in the example provided, they have a sample decision tree for a different problem. The user's instruction is to format their own decision tree as a Python function. Wait, maybe I need to assume that the user expects me to create a decision tree based on the features provided, but without explicit nodes, perhaps I need to make an educated guess based on typical medical decision trees for this scenario?

Alternatively, maybe there was a mistake in the problem setup, but since the user included an example, perhaps the actual decision tree is supposed to be constructed here. Wait, the user might have intended to provide a decision tree structure but forgot. Wait, looking again at the problem description, the user says "format this decision tree as a Python function" but didn't provide the tree. That's confusing. Wait, maybe in the initial prompt, the user provided a decision tree structure, but perhaps it was omitted in the current context. Since the user is asking me to write the code, maybe I have to create a plausible decision tree based on the features given.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is expecting me to use the example provided as a template but with the features from the horse colic problem. Let me see the example again. The example decision tree in the problem uses HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level as split nodes. So maybe for this problem, I need to come up with a similar structure using the provided features.

The target variable is "target", which is whether surgery is needed (0 or 1). Let me think about which features are most critical for determining surgery. 

Looking at the features, some key features might be rectal_temperature, pulse, respiratory_rate (vital signs), mucous_membranes, capillary_refill_time, peristalsis, abdominal_distension, nasogastric_tube, abdominal_distension, packed_cell_volume, total_protein, etc. 

Perhaps the decision tree might start with a critical vital sign like rectal_temperature. For example, if the rectal temperature is too high or low, that might indicate a more severe condition requiring surgery. 

Alternatively, maybe the presence of certain clinical findings like peristalsis being absent (since peristalsis is a feature with options 1-4, 1 being absent), that could be a key indicator. 

Another thought: the example has two nodes, so maybe the user expects a decision tree of similar depth. Let me consider a depth 2 tree. Let me try to come up with a plausible structure.

First, let's pick a root node. Maybe the packed_cell_volume (PCV) is a critical factor. PCV is a measure of red blood cells, and if it's too high or low, surgery might be needed. Suppose the root node is PCV <= some threshold, say 45% (since PCV is in %, and normal ranges for horses might be around 30-45, so maybe above that is critical). 

Wait, but the target is to decide surgery. Let me think: a horse with a packed cell volume over 45 might indicate dehydration or other issues requiring surgery. Alternatively, maybe the total_protein in abdominocentesis is high, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, let's pick a feature that's more obviously critical. 

Alternatively, the rectal temperature: a high rectal temperature (e.g., over 40°C) could indicate severe infection or other emergencies needing surgery. Let's say root node is rectal_temperature > 39.5°C. If yes, then proceed to next node. 

The next node could be something like the presence of peristalsis. If peristalsis is absent (since peristalsis=1 is absent), then maybe that's a sign of intestinal obstruction, requiring surgery. 

Alternatively, the capillary refill time being more than 3 seconds (since capillary_refill_time=0 means that). If the first node is capillary_refill_time == 0 (more than 3 seconds), then that's a sign of shock, leading to surgery. 

Hmm, perhaps the first split is on capillary_refill_time. Suppose:

Root node: capillary_refill_time == 0 (i.e., more than 3 seconds). If yes, then predict surgery (1). If no, then go to next node.

Second node: maybe peristalsis being absent (peristalsis == 1). If peristalsis is absent, then surgery (1). Else, maybe no (0).

Wait, but this is just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the first node is the presence of abdominal distension (abdominal_distension). For example, severe abdominal distension (abdominal_distension=3) might lead to surgery. 

Alternatively, let's think of a possible decision path. Let me try to outline a possible decision tree structure:

Suppose the first node is the packed_cell_volume (PCV) greater than 45. If yes, then proceed to check another feature, like total_protein. 

Alternatively, let's think of a simple tree with two splits. Let's say the first node is the rectal_temperature. Suppose if rectal_temperature > 39.5, then go to the next node. Otherwise, maybe predict no surgery (0). 

Then, the next node could be the presence of pain: if pain is continuous severe (pain=2), then surgery. 

Alternatively, since this is a made-up tree, perhaps it's better to pick features with numerical thresholds. Let's try:

Root node: packed_cell_volume > 45. 

If yes, then next node: abdomcentesis_total_protein > 4.5 g/dl. If that's yes, then surgery (1). If no, then no surgery (0). 

Wait, but that would be a depth of 2. The nodes list would be of length 2, as in the example. 

Alternatively, maybe the first node is the total_protein (total_protein in blood?), but not sure. 

Alternatively, looking at the example given by the user for diabetes, the first split was on HbA1c and then blood glucose. So the structure is:

if node0 (HbA1c_level <= 6.7):

   then check node1 (blood glucose <=210). 

   if node1, predict 0, else 1.

Else, predict 1.

So the tree has two nodes. 

So for the horse colic problem, perhaps a similar approach. Let's pick two features as split points. 

First, the root node could be the rectal_temperature. Let's say if it's above 40°C, then surgery is more likely. Suppose the threshold is 39.5. 

Second node could be the packed_cell_volume. 

Wait, perhaps the first split is on packed_cell_volume. Let's say if PCV > 45, then proceed. 

Then, the second node could be the total_protein (total_protein in blood is over, say, 7 g/dl). 

Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to use features that have clear thresholds. Let me check the feature descriptions again. 

Looking at the features:

packed_cell_volume: %, so possible thresholds like 45.

total_protein: g/dl, perhaps 6 or 7.

abdomcentesis_total_protein: also g/dl. 

Alternatively, capillary_refill_time: if it's more than 3 seconds (value 0), that's a critical sign. 

So maybe the first split is on capillary_refill_time being more than 3 seconds (0). If yes, then surgery (1). If no, then check another feature like peristalsis. 

For instance:

root node: capillary_refill_time == 0 (more than 3 seconds). If yes, predict surgery (1). 

If not, then check peristalsis: if peristalsis is absent (1), then surgery (1). Else, no. 

Wait, but that would be a depth of 2. The nodes list would have two entries. 

Alternatively, the structure could be:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [0]*2  # two nodes
    nodes[0] = (X['capillary_refill_time'] == 0)
    nodes[1] = (X['peristalsis'] == 1)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes

But in this case, the nodes list would have entries 1 or 0. 

Alternatively, maybe the first node is capillary_refill_time being more than 3 (so value 0), then yes. If that's true, predict 1. 

Else, check another condition like packed_cell_volume. 

Wait, but the user's example uses comparison operators like <=, so perhaps the first node should be a boolean derived from a comparison. 

Let me think of another approach. Suppose:

First node: rectal_temperature > 39.5. 

Second node: packed_cell_volume > 45. 

Then, the tree structure could be:

if rectal_temp > 39.5:

    if packed_cell >45 → predict 1

    else → 0?

Wait, no, but then the decision might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the root is packed_cell >45. If yes, then check another feature. 

Alternatively, let's consider the features that are more likely to lead to surgery. For example, if the horse has severe pain, or certain examination findings. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first node is the presence of pain (pain code 2, which is continuous severe pain). If the pain is severe (pain >=2?), but the exact encoding is given. Pain is 1=alert, 2=continuous severe, etc. So if pain is 2 or 5 (intermittent severe), maybe that's critical. 

Alternatively, maybe the first node is whether the nasogastric tube has significant reflux. 

Alternatively, since I'm making this up, perhaps I need to pick two features and thresholds that make sense. 

Alternatively, let's pick the root node as the packed_cell_volume (PCV) being above 45, which could indicate dehydration or other issues requiring surgery. 

Second node could be the abdomcentesis_total_protein (abdominal fluid's protein level) being above 4.0. 

Then the logic could be:

If PCV >45 → then check abdomcentesis_total_protein. If that's above 4 → surgery (1). Else, maybe 0. 

Alternatively, if PCV is high, then even if the protein is low, maybe surgery is needed. 

Alternatively, the tree could be:

root node: PCV >45 → yes: go to node1 (abdomcentesis_total_protein >4.0). 

Then, if node1 is true, predict 1, else predict 0. 

Alternatively, if PCV is over 45, then surgery (regardless of other factors?), but that may not be accurate. 

Alternatively, the tree could be:

if PCV >45 → then predict 1 (surgery). 

But that might be too simplistic. 

Alternatively, let's see in the example, the two nodes are HbA1c and blood glucose. The first split is HbA1c <=6.7, then if that's true, check blood glucose. 

So perhaps the decision tree for the horse colic would have:

First node: rectal_temperature >39.5 (high fever). 

Second node: packed_cell_volume >45. 

Then:

if temp >39.5 → then check PCV. 

If PCV is also high → surgery (1). 

Else → maybe not. 

Alternatively, the structure could be:

if temp >39.5 → predict 1. 

Else, check PCV. 

Wait, but that would have depth 2. 

Alternatively, let's proceed to code a structure with two nodes. 

Let's say:

First node: capillary_refill_time is more than 3 seconds (value 0). 

Second node: packed_cell_volume >45. 

The code would be:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [False, False]
    nodes[0] = (X['capillary_refill_time'] == 0)
    nodes[1] = (X['packed_cell_volume'] >45)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        return 1, nodes
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            return 1, nodes
        else:
            return 0, nodes

Wait, but then the nodes list would be two elements. 

Alternatively, perhaps a more logical structure:

Root node: capillary_refill_time >3 sec (==0). If yes → surgery (1). 

If not → check peristalsis. 

Wait, peristalsis is a categorical variable with values 1 to 4 (since peristalsis options are 1:absent, 2:reduced, 3:normal, 4:hyperactive). 

So, if peristalsis is absent (1), then surgery. 

So code could be:

nodes[0] = X['capillary_refill_time'] ==0 

nodes[1] = X['peristalsis'] ==1 

if nodes[0] → predict 1 

else: 

   if nodes[1] → predict1 

   else 0 

But in this case, the nodes list is two elements, and the logic is as above. 

Alternatively, to follow the example where the first node is a comparison, let me use a numerical feature for the first node. 

Suppose the first node is packed_cell_volume >45. 

Second node: abdomcentesis_total_protein >4.0. 

Then, the code:

nodes[0] = (X['packed_cell_volume'] >45)

nodes[1] = (X['abdomcentesis_total_protein'] >4.0)

if nodes[0] is True:

   then if nodes[1] → predict1, else 0 ?

Wait, not sure. 

Alternatively, if first node is True (high PCV), then check the second node. 

Suppose if PCV >45, then the next node is whether abdomcentesis_total_protein is high. 

If both are true, predict 1. 

Alternatively, maybe the decision is 1 if either is true? 

Alternatively, perhaps the logic is:

if PCV >45 → predict 1 (regardless of other factors). 

But that may not be right. 

Alternatively, perhaps:

if PCV >45 → then check abdomcentesis_total_protein. 

If that's also above 4 → predict 1, else 0. 

Alternatively, maybe even if PCV is high but the protein is low, then no. 

This is getting a bit too speculative. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first node is the abdomcentesis_total_protein >4.0. 

Second node: packed_cell_volume >45. 

Then:

if abdo_protein >4 → predict 1. 

Else, check PCV. If PCV>45 → predict1, else 0. 

Hmm, but this is just making things up. 

Alternatively, given the time constraints, perhaps I can choose two features with clear thresholds and write the code accordingly. 

Let me pick:

First node: capillary_refill_time is more than 3 seconds (value 0). 

Second node: peristalsis is absent (value 1). 

Then the code would be:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [0,0]
    # node0: capillary_refill_time ==0 (more than 3 seconds)
    nodes[0] = (X['capillary_refill_time'] ==0)
    # node1: peristalsis is absent (1)
    nodes[1] = (X['peristalsis'] ==1)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction =1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction=1
        else:
            prediction=0
    return prediction, nodes

This way, if either node0 or node1 is true, predict 1. 

Alternatively, maybe node1 is only checked if node0 is false. 

Alternatively, perhaps the second node is the packed_cell_volume. 

Alternatively, let's choose the following:

root node: packed_cell_volume >45. 

Second node: abdomcentesis_total_protein >4. 

Then:

if PCV >45 → check if protein >4. 

If yes → surgery. 

Else → no. 

Else (PCV <=45) → check protein? 

Wait, not sure. 

Alternatively, the first node is PCV >45. 

Then:

if PCV>45 → predict 1. 

Else, check protein. 

If protein >4 → predict1. 

Else →0. 

In that case, the nodes would be:

nodes[0] = PCV>45 

nodes[1] = protein>4 

Then code:

if nodes[0] → predict1 

else: 

   if nodes[1] →1 else 0 

Thus, the code would be:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [False, False]
    nodes[0] = (X['packed_cell_volume'] >45)
    nodes[1] = (X['abdomcentesis_total_protein'] >4.0)
    if nodes[0]:
        return 1, nodes
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            return 1, nodes
        else:
            return 0, nodes

This way, the prediction is 1 if either PCV is high or protein is high (but only check protein if PCV isn't high). 

This could be a possible structure. 

Alternatively, in the first example, the first node is a gatekeeper. If it's true, then you don't need to check the second node, but in code, you still have to evaluate both nodes. 

Alternatively, the nodes list is just the boolean conditions, but the code must compute both. 

Therefore, I think this is a plausible structure. 

Now, to write the code accordingly. 

Therefore, the final code would look like this, with the chosen features and thresholds. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should pick features that are more clearly associated with needing surgery. 

Another thought: the presence of severe pain (pain=2) could be critical. 

Root node: pain >=2 (since 2 is continuous severe). 

Second node: peristalsis absent (1). 

Then:

if pain is severe → predict 1. 

Else, if peristalsis is absent → predict1. 

Else 0. 

Thus code:

nodes[0] = X['pain'] >=2 

nodes[1] = X['peristalsis'] ==1 

if nodes[0] →1 

else: 

   if nodes[1] →1 else 0 

This is another possible structure. 

Alternatively, since the user's example uses numerical comparisons (like HbA1c <=6.7), maybe I should use numerical features. 

Alright, I think the first approach with packed_cell and abdomcentesis protein is okay. 

So the code would be:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [False, False]
    nodes[0] = (X['packed_cell_volume'] > 45)  # first node
    nodes[1] = (X['abdomcentesis_total_protein'] > 4.0)  # second node
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes

This way, the tree has two nodes. 

Alternatively, let me check the feature names again to ensure correctness. 

Looking back at the problem statement, the user provided the features and their descriptions. 

The feature names in the problem's feature descriptions include:

- packed_cell_volume: percentage, so numerical. 

- abdomcentesis_total_protein: this is part of the "abdomcentesis_total_protein" feature, which is g/dl, numerical. 

Yes. 

Therefore, this seems okay. 

Alternatively, maybe the first node should be abdomcentesis_total_protein. 

Wait, but the user's example has the first node as a primary condition, then the second as a secondary. 

Alternatively, the first node could be the abdomcentesis_total_protein >4.0. 

If yes → surgery. 

Else, check packed_cell. 

But that's the reverse. 

Alternatively, the first node is the more critical one. 

Alternatively, given that I have to choose two features and thresholds, I'll proceed with this structure. 

Thus, the code as above. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first node is the packed_cell_volume >45, second node is the abdomcentesis_total_protein >4.0. 

If both are true → surgery. 

Wait, but that would require an AND condition. 

Alternatively, in the code above, if the first node is true (PCV>45), then predict 1 regardless of the second node. 

Thus, the decision is 1 if PCV>45, else check protein. 

Thus, the logic is: PCV high → surgery, else if protein high → surgery. 

This could be a reasonable approach. 

Thus, the code is as I wrote. 

Therefore, this is the answer.
