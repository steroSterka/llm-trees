Okay, so I need to build a decision tree classifier for determining if a horse colic lesion is surgical or not. The features provided are a bunch of medical indicators, and the target is whether the outcome required surgery. The maximum depth is 2, so it can't go too deep. Let me start by recalling how decision trees work. They split the data based on the feature that provides the best information gain or the highest purity.

First, I should figure out which features are the most important. Since I don't have actual data, I have to rely on domain knowledge. Horse colic can be due to various issues like impaction, displacement, etc., which might require surgery. Features like peristalsis (absent?), Nasogastric Reflux (significant?), Abdominocentesis findings (like cloudy or high protein), and maybe Pain level (severe) could be important. But I need to pick the top ones for the splits.

The example given used petal width first. Maybe here, a key feature is something like "Packed Cell Volume (%)" which is a blood test. High PCV might indicate dehydration or blood loss, which could be surgical. Alternatively, "Abdomen Appearance" if it's distended or has something abnormal. "Pain Level" being severe might be a strong indicator. Let's see.

Wait, the outcome is "Outcome (lived / died / euthanized)", but the target is whether it's surgical. Hmm, maybe the actual target variable isn't listed here. Wait, the problem says "classify whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not". So the outcome here might be "surgery (yes/no)", but looking back at the features, the first feature is "surgery (yes/no)". Wait, that's confusing. The features include surgery as a variable, but that's the target variable? Wait no, the user says "classify whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not". So the target is whether the surgery was performed, which is given as a feature here. Wait, that can't be. The features include "surgery (yes/no)", which would be the target variable, so that's probably a mistake. Wait, no, maybe the user made a typo. Wait in the example, the features didn't include the class, so in the problem, the features include "surgery (yes/no)" but the target is also whether it's surgical. That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the actual target variable is the "Outcome" but the user wants to predict whether the lesion is surgical, which might be inferred from the outcome? Or perhaps "surgery" is part of the features, but the target is another variable. Wait, the user's instruction says "classify whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not", so the target variable is "surgical (yes/no)", but that's already listed as a feature. That can't be. Wait, maybe the features were listed incorrectly. Let me check again.

Looking back: The features list starts with "surgery (yes / no)", then other features like Age, etc., and the last feature is "Outcome (lived / died / euthanized)". The user's goal is to classify whether the lesion is surgical or not, which probably is the "surgery" variable. But if that's the target variable, then it's already in the features, which would be a problem because you can't use the target as a feature. Maybe the user made a mistake here, perhaps the "surgery" feature is a typo, and the actual target is "Outcome", but that's three categories. Alternatively, maybe the target is whether the horse needed surgery, which is the "surgery" variable, so we have to build a model to predict "surgery (yes/no)" based on the other features. That makes sense. So the target is "surgery (yes/no)", and the features are the rest except "surgery" and "Outcome" (if outcome is not part of the features to use? Wait, the problem says "Features" are the list given, including surgery and outcome. But the target is "surgical or not" which is "surgery (yes/no)". Therefore, the model uses all features except surgery and outcome? Or is outcome part of the features? Wait, the problem says "build a decision tree... classify whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not" which is the surgery variable. So the surgery variable is the target, and the other features (excluding outcome?) are the inputs. Wait, but the features include outcome as well. Hmm, perhaps outcome is irrelevant here. The user might have included all possible features, but in building the model, we have to use the other features except "surgery" to predict "surgery". So the surgery is the target variable, and the features are all the others. But the user included "Outcome (lived / died / euthanized)" as a feature. Maybe that's also part of the features. But the target is surgery. So I need to proceed.

Now, to build a decision tree of max depth 2. So root node, then split into two children, each of which can split again once more. So total depth 2.

First, I need to select the best feature to split at the root. Let's think of possible key features. Let me list the features again, excluding surgery (since that's the target) and maybe outcome? Or is outcome part of the features? The user included it in the features, so I have to include it unless told otherwise. Wait, the problem says "Features" are all the listed ones except the target. The target is "surgical or not", which is the "surgery" feature. So "surgery" is the target variable, and all the others are features, including "Outcome". Hmm, but maybe "Outcome" is the result after treatment, so maybe it's not available at the time of decision. But since the user provided it as a feature, perhaps it's included. Not sure, but proceed.

So possible features for splitting: Age (adult/young), Rectal Temperature, Pulse, Respiratory Rate, Temperature of Extremities (normal/warm/cool/cold), Strength of Peripheral Pulse (normal/increased/reduced/absent), Appearance of Mucous Membranes (multiple categories), Capillary Refill Time, Degree of Pain (none/mild/moderate/severe), peristalsis (hypermotile/normal/hypomotile/absent), Abdominal Distension (none/slight/moderate/severe), Nasogastric Tube (none/slight/significant), Nasogastric Reflux (none/ >1 liter / <1 liter), Nasogastric Reflux pH, Rectal Examination Findings (normal/increased/decreased/absent), Abdomen Appearance (normal/other/feces in large intestine/distended small intestine/distended large intestine), Packed Cell Volume (%), Total Protein (g/dl), Abdominocentesis Appearance (clear/cloudy/serosanguinous), Abdominocentesis Total Protein (g/dl), Outcome (lived/died/euthanized).

Wait, that's a lot. So to choose the best feature for the first split, maybe something like Packed Cell Volume (PCV) as a numerical variable. High PCV indicates dehydration, which might be associated with more severe cases needing surgery. Alternatively, peristalsis being absent might indicate a blockage requiring surgery. Degree of Pain: severe pain might indicate a more urgent surgical case. Abdominal Distension could be a sign. Or Nasogastric Reflux: if there's significant reflux, that might suggest impaction needing surgery.

Alternatively, looking at the example, they used a numerical feature first (petal width) with a threshold. So maybe pick a numerical feature here. Let me think of possible numerical features: Rectal Temperature (Â°C), Pulse (beats/min), Respiratory Rate (breaths/min), PCV (%), Total Protein (g/dl), Nasogastric Reflux pH, Abdominocentesis Total Protein (g/dl). These are numerical. Categorical features are the rest.

In decision trees, splitting on numerical features can be done by finding a threshold. For example, PCV above a certain value might be a good split. Alternatively, for categorical variables, like "Degree of Pain", splitting into severe vs others might be useful.

Now, considering that the maximum depth is 2, the root node splits into two branches, each of which can split again. So the root must be a feature that gives the most information gain, and then the children can split on other features.

Let me hypothesize:

Root split: Degree of Pain (categorical: none, mild, moderate, severe). Suppose that severe pain is a strong indicator for surgery. So splitting on Degree of Pain <= moderate vs severe. If severe, then more likely surgical. Then, the next splits could be, for example, peristalsis (absent) or PCV above a certain value.

Alternatively, the first split could be on Peristalsis. If peristalsis is absent, then likely surgical. The second level could split on something else like PCV.

Alternatively, maybe Nasogastric Reflux: if the reflux is >1 liter, that's significant and might need surgery. So first split on Nasogastric Reflux >1 liter.

Alternatively, Abdomen Appearance: if it's distended small intestine, that's a surgical sign.

But without data, I have to make educated guesses. Let me think of common indicators. For instance, in equine colic, the presence of certain findings on rectal exam, absence of peristalsis, severe pain, abnormal mucous membranes (like dark, prolonged capillary refill), high PCV, etc., are more likely to indicate surgical cases.

Perhaps the first split is on Peristalsis (hypermotile, normal, hypomotile, absent). If peristalsis is absent, that's a strong indicator for surgery. So splitting on Peristalsis = absent vs others.

Then, for the next splits: maybe PCV. If peristalsis is absent, then even a lower PCV might still require surgery. But if peristalsis is present but low, then PCV over a certain level might trigger surgery.

Alternatively, at the root node, PCV: if PCV > 45%, then maybe more likely surgical. Then split on something else.

Alternatively, the first split is on the Degree of Pain. Let's say if pain is severe, then high chance of surgery. Then, for non-severe cases, maybe split on peristalsis.

Alternatively, let's consider the example given. The example used a numerical feature (petal width) first, then another numerical. Maybe here, the first split is numerical. Let's pick PCV as the root. Suppose the optimal split is PCV > 45% (hypovolemia or dehydration). Then, if PCV is above that, maybe more likely surgical. Then, in the next split, maybe Degree of Pain: severe.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Abdominal Distension. If it's severe, then surgical.

Alternatively, looking for features that have clear thresholds. Let me think of PCV: a high PCV is a sign of dehydration, which is common in colic, but does that necessitate surgery? Not necessarily, but combined with other factors. Maybe not the strongest.

Alternatively, the presence of Nasogastric Reflux >1 liter might indicate obstruction, which is often surgical. So first split on Nasogastric Reflux >1 liter. If yes, then surgery likely. Then, for the other branch, maybe split on peristalsis.

Alternatively, the Appearance of Mucous Membranes: if they're pale cyanotic or dark, that might indicate shock, which is more likely to need surgery.

This is tricky without data. Let me try to think of the most critical factors. In equine colic, absence of peristalsis is a strong indicator for surgical intervention. So perhaps the first split is on peristalsis: absent vs others. Then, if absent, predict surgery yes. But the depth is 2, so maybe the next split is on another variable for the other branch.

Alternatively, the first split could be on Degree of Pain (severe vs others). If severe, then more likely surgery. Then, for non-severe cases, maybe split on peristalsis.

Alternatively, combining two variables: suppose the root is on peristalsis (absent vs present), then for absent, split on PCV (high vs low). But since depth is 2, each path can have two splits.

Alternatively, first split on Nasogastric Tube (significant vs others). Significant reflux might indicate impaction which needs surgery.

Hmm, maybe let's try constructing the tree step by step.

First, choose the root feature. Let's go with Peristalsis being absent as the key indicator. So:

Root node: Peristalsis = absent vs others.

If absent (left branch), then maybe 80% are surgical, so class: surgery yes.

The other branch (right, peristalsis not absent), then split on another feature. Maybe Degree of Pain. If pain is severe, then surgery yes, else no.

Alternatively, for the right branch, split on PCV. If PCV > 45, then surgery yes.

Alternatively, if peristalsis is not absent, but pain is severe, then surgery.

Alternatively, maybe Degree of Pain is better as the root.

Root split: Degree of Pain <= moderate vs severe.

If severe (left), then surgery yes.

For the right branch (moderate or less), split on peristalsis: absent vs others. If absent, then surgery yes; else, maybe no.

This would give a depth 2 tree.

Alternatively, let's structure it as:

Root: Peristalsis (absent)

- If yes (absent), then class: surgery yes.

- If no (present), then next split on Degree of Pain (severe).

   - If severe: surgery yes

   - Else: surgery no

This way, the tree has two splits (root and then left/right), but the depth is 2 (the root is level 1, then the next level is 2). Wait, the depth is counted as the number of edges from root to leaf. So in this case, each path has two edges, so depth 2.

Alternatively, another structure:

Root: Degree of Pain (severe)

- If yes: surgery yes

- If no: split on Peristalsis (absent)

   - If absent: surgery yes

   - Else: surgery no

This would be depth 2. So that's a possible structure.

Alternatively, maybe using a numerical feature first. Let's say PCV.

Root: PCV > 45%

- If yes: then split on Degree of Pain (severe)

   - If severe: surgery yes

   - Else: maybe no?

Wait, but that would go to depth 2.

Alternatively, if PCV >45 is the root, and then for each, another split on peristalsis.

But maybe the key features are better as the categorical ones.

Alternatively, looking for features that have clear two-way splits. Let's think of the example given used petal width (numerical) with a threshold. Maybe the first split is on a numerical variable like PCV. Let's say the optimal split is PCV > 45% (hypovolemia). Then:

Root: PCV >45%

- If yes: maybe split on peristalsis (absent). But that's depth 2.

Wait, but then the tree would be:

PCV >45? Yes -> next split on peristalsis absent -> then leaves.

But the depth would be 2.

Alternatively, the second split could be on another variable.

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on Degree of Pain (severe). So:

Root PCV >45:

- Yes: next split on severe pain. If severe, surgery yes; else, no?

But this is getting complicated. Since I have to make a decision without data, I'll go with the most logical splits based on equine medicine knowledge.

In that case, the first split is on Peristalsis being absent (since that's a major indicator). Then, for those with peristalsis absent, they are more likely surgical. For those with peristalsis present, the next split could be on the Degree of Pain (severe). So:

Decision Tree:

|--- Peristalsis = absent

||--- class: surgery yes

|--- Peristalsis != absent

||--- Degree of Pain = severe

|||--- class: surgery yes

|||--- class: surgery no

This is a depth 2 tree. The first split at root is peristalsis, then the right branch splits on pain. This way, if peristalsis is absent, predict surgery yes. If present, check pain: if severe, then yes, else no.

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on another feature. Let me check another possibility.

Alternatively, first split on Nasogastric Reflux >1 liter:

|--- Nasogastric Reflux >1 liter

||--- class: surgery yes

|--- else:

||--- split on Peristalsis absent:

|||--- yes: surgery yes

|||--- no: surgery no

This also works, but I think peristalsis absence is a stronger indicator.

Alternatively, another approach using PCV:

Root split: PCV > 45%

- If yes: split on Degree of Pain (severe). If severe, surgery yes, else maybe no?

But without knowing how they interact, it's hard.

Alternatively, maybe the best is to use Peristalsis as root, then Degree of Pain as the next.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on Degree of Pain (severe), then next on peristalsis.

Either way, I need to pick one.

Another angle: In the example, the first split was a numerical feature with a threshold. So maybe pick a numerical feature here. Let's say PCV.

Suppose the optimal split is PCV >45%, then:

Root: PCV >45%

- If yes: split on Peristalsis absent (if absent, then yes; else maybe no?)

Wait, but the depth is okay.

Alternatively, if PCV >45, then class: surgery yes; else, check another variable.

But that would be depth 1 if we don't split further. So need to have two splits.

Hmm. Alternatively, PCV >45 is root, then next split on Degree of Pain (severe). So:

PCV >45?

- Yes:

   - split on pain severe? -> yes: surgery yes; no: ?

Wait, this could lead to four leaves, but with depth 2, each path has two splits. Maybe:

PCV >45? left (yes):

   - then split on peristalsis absent:

      - yes: surgery yes

      - no: maybe surgery no

Right (no PCV high):

   - split on pain severe:

      - yes: surgery yes

      - no: surgery no

But that requires two splits on each branch, so the tree depth is 2.

But this might be overcomplicating. Since I need to make a choice, and given common knowledge, the most critical factor is absence of peristalsis. Therefore, structuring the tree with peristalsis first, then pain.

Thus, my proposed decision tree is:

Root split: Peristalsis = absent?

- If yes: class: surgery yes (depth 1)

- If no: split on Degree of Pain = severe?

   - If yes: class: surgery yes (depth 2)

   - If no: class: surgery no (depth 2)

This satisfies the maximum depth of 2.

Alternatively, if peristalsis is not absent, but pain is severe, then surgery yes.

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on PCV.

But I think the first answer is better.

Alternatively, another possibility is using a numerical feature first.

Suppose root split is on PCV >45%:

- If yes: next split on peristalsis absent:

   - yes (absent): surgery yes

   - no: surgery yes?

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively:

PCV >45% ?

- Yes: split on peristalsis absent. If absent, yes; else, maybe no?

But this might not capture.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on Degree of Pain (severe):

- If yes: surgery yes

- If no: split on peristalsis absent:

   - yes: surgery yes

   - no: surgery no

This would also be a depth 2 tree, and maybe more accurate, as severe pain itself is an indicator, but absence of peristalsis is another.

This structure might be better, as even if pain isn't severe, absence of peristalsis indicates surgery.

In that case:

|--- Degree of Pain = severe

||--- class: surgery yes

|--- Degree of Pain < severe

||--- Peristalsis = absent

|||--- class: surgery yes

|||--- class: surgery no

This way, any case with severe pain or absent peristalsis is considered surgical. The rest are not. This seems logical.

Alternatively, the first split on Peristalsis absent, then for the other branch, split on severe pain. Both structures are valid.

Between the two, which is better? In equine practice, absence of peristalsis is a stronger indicator than pain level, perhaps. So maybe the first split on peristalsis is better.

However, severe pain can also be a reason even with some peristalsis.

Given the problem asks to "create" a decision tree, not to optimize, so either is acceptable. But to pick one.

Alternatively, the example used a numerical feature first (petal width), so perhaps following that structure, I should pick a numerical feature here.

Let me see. Let's choose PCV as the root.

Suppose the optimal threshold for PCV is 45%.

Root: PCV >45%

- If yes, then split on Peristalsis absent?

Wait, but again, need to structure.

Alternatively, if PCV >45:

   then class: surgery yes

Else:

   split on Degree of Pain = severe?

   - yes: surgery yes

   - else: no

This would also be depth 2. The root's left branch is depth 1, the right branch splits again.

This way:

|--- PCV >45%

||--- class: surgery yes

|--- PCV <=45%

||--- Degree of Pain = severe

|||--- class: surgery yes

|||--- class: surgery no

This could be another structure. If the PCV is high (indicating dehydration), surgery is needed regardless of pain. If not, then check pain level.

Alternatively, maybe this is better, as high PCV is a sign of dehydration, which might indicate a more severe case needing surgery, even without absence of peristalsis.

I think this is a reasonable approach. Let's go with this one.

Alternatively, another numerical feature: Nasogastric Reflux. Suppose the split is on Nasogastric Reflux >1 liter:

Root: Reflux >1L?

- If yes: surgery yes

- If no:

   split on Peristalsis absent:

      yes: surgery yes

      no: surgery no

This would also be a depth 2 tree.

Alternatively, combining both features.

Given that, perhaps the best is to choose one of these structures. Since the user's example used a numerical feature with a threshold, I'll follow that style.

Therefore, I'll propose:

Root split: Peristalsis = absent?

- Yes â surgery yes (depth 1)

- No â split on Degree of Pain = severe?

   - Yes â surgery yes (depth 2)

   - No â surgery no (depth 2)

This uses a categorical feature first (Peristalsis) and then a categorical (pain), but the depth is 2. Alternatively, using a numerical feature first.

Alternatively, perhaps the second split can be numerical. For example, after Peristalsis is present, split on PCV >45.

So:

Root: Peristalsis absent?

- Yes â surgery yes

- No â split on PCV >45%?

   - Yes â surgery yes

   - No â surgery no

This might be better, as PCV is a numerical feature.

This structure also has depth 2, using a numerical split at the second level.

This could be a good structure, as it combines two key indicators: peristalsis absence and PCV.

Alternatively, if the second split is on pain, as before.

I think either is acceptable, but to follow the example's structure, which used two numerical splits, perhaps using PCV as the second split.

Therefore, let's go with:

Root: Peristalsis = absent?

- Yes â surgery yes

- No â PCV >45% ?

   - Yes â surgery yes

   - No â surgery no

This way, the first split is categorical, the second is numerical, both important indicators.

Alternatively, maybe the first split should be numerical. Let me try that.

Suppose root split is on PCV >45%:

- Yes â split on Peristalsis absent?

   - Yes â surgery yes

   - No â surgery yes? Not sure.

Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively:

Root: PCV >45% ?

- Yes â surgery yes

- No â split on Peristalsis absent?

   - Yes â surgery yes

   - No â split on Degree of Pain = severe?

Wait, that would go beyond depth 2.

Alternatively, if PCV is not high, then split on Peristalsis:

- If Peristalsis is absent â yes

- else â split on pain severe â yes/no

But that requires depth 3.

No, to keep depth at 2:

Root: PCV >45%?

- Yes â surgery yes

- No â split on (Peristalsis absent OR Degree of Pain severe)?

But we can't combine in a split.

Alternatively, split on Peristalsis absent:

Root: PCV >45% â yes

Else:

   split on Peristalsis absent â if yes, then yes; else â split on pain?

But depth would exceed.

Therefore, keeping it simple, perhaps the first tree structure I proposed is better.

Final answer: I'll choose the first structure with Peristalsis first, then Degree of Pain.

Alternatively, let me check common decision trees in medical contexts. Often, critical signs are checked first.

In equine colic, absence of peristalsis is a critical sign indicating possible obstruction, needing surgery. Severe pain (e.g., rolling, kicking) is also an indicator. So the structure where absence of peristalsis leads directly to surgery, and if present, check for severe pain, making the second split on pain, is logical.

Therefore, the decision tree would be:

Root: Is there absence of peristalsis?

- Yes â Surgery

- No â Is the pain severe?

   - Yes â Surgery

   - No â No Surgery

This is a simple decision tree with maximum depth 2, using categorical features, which is similar to the example's structure but with categorical splits. Since the example used a numerical feature with a threshold, but this context allows categorical splits, this is acceptable.

Alternatively, if we need to use a numerical feature like PCV, then:

Root: Is PCV >45%?

- Yes â Surgery

- No â Is there absence of peristalsis?

   - Yes â Surgery

   - No â Is pain severe?

      - Yes â Surgery

      - No â No Surgery

But this exceeds depth 2. Hence, the first structure is better.

Thus, the final answer is the tree with Peristalsis first, then Pain.
</think>

**Decision Tree:**

1. **Root Node:** Is there absence of peristalsis?
   - **Yes:** Recommend surgery (depth 1).
   - **No:** Proceed to the next question.

2. **Second Node (if peristalsis is present):** Is the pain severe?
   - **Yes:** Recommend surgery (depth 2).
   - **No:** Do not recommend surgery (depth 2).

**Explanation:**
- **First Split (Categorical):** Absence of peristalsis is a critical indicator of severe gastrointestinal issues (e.g., obstruction), necessitating surgery regardless of pain level.
- **Second Split (Categorical):** If peristalsis is present, severe pain (e.g., signs like rolling, thrashing) suggests the need for surgery, while mild pain may indicate a non-surgical condition.

This structure ensures a maximum depth of 2 while prioritizing clinically significant factors. 

**Answer:**  
The decision tree recommends surgery if there is absence of peristalsis or severe pain when peristalsis is present, with a maximum depth of 2.  

\boxed{  
\begin{aligned}

<think>
Okay, I need to create a Python function that predicts whether a horse colic lesion is surgical based on the given features. The function should return the prediction and a list of node truth values. Let me start by understanding the problem and the features provided.

First, the target variable is 'target', which is 0 for no surgery and 1 for surgery. The features include various medical measurements and categorical data. The example provided uses a decision tree structure, so I need to build a similar structure here.

The user mentioned that if there are placeholders for thresholds, I should fill them with meaningful values. Since I don't have the actual decision tree structure provided, I'll have to make educated guesses based on common medical thresholds and the feature descriptions. Let me think about the important features first.

Looking at the features, rectal_temperature might be a good starting point. A high or low temperature could indicate a problem. For example, a rectal temperature above 39.5Â°C might be a critical value. Let's say the first split is on rectal_temperature > 39.5. If true, maybe proceed to check another condition.

Next, pulse (beats per minute) could be another critical feature. A high pulse rate might indicate distress. Suppose after the temperature split, the next node checks if the pulse is above 80. 

But wait, maybe the first split should be on 'surgery' or 'outcome'? Wait no, the target is 'target', so the features are the inputs. The surgery variable here is part of the features but maybe not relevant since the target is whether it's surgical. Wait, looking back, the features list includes 'surgery' as a feature. Wait, the description says 'surgery: surgery (1 = no, 2 = yes)' but the target is the surgical outcome. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, perhaps the 'surgery' feature is part of the input? That might be conflicting because the target is whether the lesion is surgical (needs surgery). Wait, maybe the 'surgery' variable is part of the features, but perhaps it's not the target. Wait, the target is 'target', which is 0 or 1 for surgery. The 'surgery' feature might be whether they had surgery, but maybe that's part of the data. However, if the target is the need for surgery, then the 'surgery' feature might actually be the outcome, but the problem states that the target is the 'target' variable. Wait, the user provided the list of features including 'surgery' and 'outcome', and the target is 'target'. So perhaps the 'surgery' is part of the input features, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the 'surgery' feature is part of the input, but perhaps it's not used here. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the feature description. But since the user provided the features as given, I need to proceed with them.

Alternatively, perhaps the decision tree uses features like rectal temperature, pulse, etc. Let me think of possible splits. For example:

The first node could check if the rectal_temperature is above a certain value, say 39.5Â°C. Then, if yes, maybe check another condition like pulse over 80. Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the packed cell volume (PCV) which is a blood test. High PCV could indicate dehydration or other issues. Suppose the first split is on packed_cell_volume > 45.

Alternatively, considering the example given in the problem statement, the example's first split was on HbA1c_level. So maybe similar here: choosing a numerical feature for the first split.

Wait, let's think of common decision points. The example had two nodes. The user's problem might expect a small depth, like depth 2 or 3. Let me try to imagine a possible decision tree structure.

Suppose the decision tree first checks the packed_cell_volume. Let's say the threshold is 45. If PCV is higher than 45, then it might indicate a need for surgery. But maybe the first split is on rectal_temperature. Let me see.

Alternatively, the first node could be the 'rectal_examination' or something like that. Let me think of possible splits. For instance, if the rectal examination shows increased findings (code 3), that might be a sign. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on 'abdominocentesis_total_protein', which is a protein level in the fluid. High protein could indicate peritonitis, which requires surgery. Suppose the threshold is 3.5 g/dl.

Hmm, this is tricky without the actual tree structure. Since I have to make up plausible thresholds and splits, I'll proceed with some assumptions.

Let me start building a possible decision tree:

First node: rectal_temperature > 39.5 â if yes, proceed to next node. If not, maybe predict no surgery (0) or yes.

Alternatively, first node: packed_cell_volume > 45. Suppose if yes, then check another condition. Let's say the next node is on pulse > 80. If so, predict 1 (surgery). 

Alternatively, first node: if the pain is in a severe category. The 'pain' feature has values like 2 (continuous severe), so maybe if pain >=2 (since 2 and above are severe?), then proceed. 

Alternatively, let's try to structure a possible tree:

Root node: Check if the packed_cell_volume (packed_cell_volume) is greater than 45. 

If yes â proceed to next node (second node): check if total_protein (maybe the total_protein in blood?) is above 7.0. 

If both are true, predict surgery (1). 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on 'abdominocentesis_total_protein' (abdomcentesis_total_protein) which is a protein level. Suppose if it's over 3.5, then surgery is needed.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on 'nasogastric_reflux_PH' (pH). A pH over 4 might indicate something. 

Alternatively, let's think step by step. Let me try to create a simple decision tree structure with two nodes as in the example.

Suppose the first node is rectal_temperature > 39.5. The second node could be pulse > 80. 

Then:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0]*2
    nodes[0] = X['rectal_temperature'] > 39.5
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X['pulse'] > 80
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but maybe the second node is different. Alternatively, the first node could be packed_cell_volume. Let's see.

Alternatively, first node: packed_cell_volume > 45.0. Second node: abdomcentesis_total_protein > 3.5.

If both are true, predict 1. 

But I need to make sure that the features are correctly named as per the given keys. The keys include 'packed_cell_volume' and 'abdomcentesis_total_protein' (note the spelling here). 

Wait, in the features, there's 'abdomcentesis_total_protein', which is spelled with 'centesis' (abdomcentesis), not 'centesis' as in abdominocentesis. So need to get the keys exactly right.

Alternatively, let's try another approach. Let me think of the most critical features for determining surgical necessity. High packed cell volume (dehydration), elevated protein levels in abdominocentesis (indicative of peritonitis), or severe clinical signs like pain or distension.

Perhaps the decision tree is structured as follows:

First node: If packed_cell_volume > 45 â yes, then second node checks abdomcentesis_total_protein > 3.5 â if yes, predict surgery (1). If either is false, predict no (0). 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on 'abdominal_distension' being severe (code 3). 

Alternatively, here's another idea: the first node is the 'nasogastric_reflux_PH' being below 4 (since normal pH might be around 4-5?), indicating acid reflux. Suppose if pH <4, that's a sign. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first node is 'rectal_examination' having increased (code 3). 

Given that I need to make up plausible splits, let's proceed with the packed_cell_volume and abdomcentesis_total_protein.

Let me try to code that:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0]*2
    nodes[0] = (X['packed_cell_volume'] > 45)
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = (X['abdomcentesis_total_protein'] > 3.5)
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but the nodes list should be of length equal to the number of inner nodes, which in this case, if it's depth 2, there are 2 nodes (the root and the second node). So the example had 2 nodes, which is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the first node is the abdomcentesis_total_protein, since that's a strong indicator. 

Alternatively, another possible structure: first check if the 'abdominocentesis_appearance' is not clear (i.e., 2 or 3). For example, if it's cloudy (2) or serosanguinous (3), then it's a sign of infection, so proceed to check another condition. 

Suppose the first node is abdominocentesis_appearance != 1 (i.e., 2 or 3). Then, second node checks the abdomcentesis_total_protein > 3.5. If both, predict 1.

Alternatively, the first node could be on 'total_protein' (the blood's total protein) being above a certain level, say 7.5 g/dL. 

Hmm, this is a bit challenging without the actual tree structure. Since the user says to "try to fill them with meaningful values," I'll choose features and thresholds that make sense.

Let me think of another approach. Suppose the first split is on 'rectal_temperature' being over 39.5Â°C. If yes, then check if the 'pulse' is over 80. If both, predict surgery.

So the code would be:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0]*2
    nodes[0] = (X['rectal_temperature'] > 39.5)
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = (X['pulse'] > 80)
        prediction = 1 if nodes[1] else 0
    else:
        prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes

This is a simple two-node decision tree. The nodes list has two entries, which are 1 or 0 based on the conditions. 

Alternatively, maybe the second node is on a different feature. Let's see. 

Another possibility: The first node is 'packed_cell_volume' > 45. If yes, then check 'total_protein' > 7.0. 

Wait, but 'total_protein' is in blood, which might correlate. 

Alternatively, the first node could be 'abdominal_distension' being severe (code 3) or moderate (1). Let's say if abdominal_distension >= 3 (since severe is code 3?), then check another condition. 

Wait, looking back at the feature descriptions:

abdominal_distension: (1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight)

So code 3 is severe. So if abdominal_distension is 3, that's severe. 

Maybe:

First node: abdominal_distension >= 3 (i.e., severe). 

Second node: check if 'nasogastric_reflux' is more than 1 liter (code 0). Because nasogastric_reflux (0 = more than 1 liter). So if that's true, then predict surgery.

So the code would be:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0]*2
    nodes[0] = (X['abdominal_distension'] >= 3)
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = (X['nasogastric_reflux'] == 0)  # since 0 means >1 liter
        prediction = 1 if nodes[1] else 0
    else:
        prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes

This could be another structure. 

Alternatively, combining multiple features. 

But since the user's example had two nodes, I'll choose a two-node tree. 

Let me pick the first option with rectal_temperature and pulse.

Another possible threshold for pulse: let's say over 100 bpm is tachycardia, indicating distress. So pulse > 100.

Then:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0]*2
    nodes[0] = (X['rectal_temperature'] > 39.5)
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = (X['pulse'] > 100)
        prediction = 1 if nodes[1] else 0
    else:
        prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes

This might be better. 

Alternatively, maybe the second node is on abdominal_distension's code. 

Alternatively, let's see another angle. Suppose the first node is 'abdominocentesis_appearance' not clear (i.e., 2 or 3). 

nodes[0] = X['abdominocentesis_appearance'] != 1

Then second node is on 'abdomcentesis_total_protein' > 3.5.

So:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0]*2
    nodes[0] = (X['abdominocentesis_appearance'] != 1)
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = (X['abdomcentesis_total_protein'] > 3.5)
        prediction = 1 if nodes[1] else 0
    else:
        prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes

This uses two features that might be relevant for surgical decision (abdominal fluid analysis).

Alternatively, I can choose the first node to be 'packed_cell_volume' over 45 and second node on 'total_protein' in blood over 7.0.

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0]*2
    nodes[0] = (X['packed_cell_volume'] > 45)
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = (X['total_protein'] > 7.0)
        prediction = 1 if nodes[1] else 0
    else:
        prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes

This also makes sense.

I think any of these would be acceptable as long as the features and thresholds are plausibly related to surgical need. Since the user allows us to fill in the values, I'll pick one structure and code it. 

Let me choose the first structure I thought of with rectal_temperature and pulse, as it's straightforward. Let's proceed with:

First node: rectal_temperature > 39.5

Second node: pulse > 100

Thus, the code would be:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0]*2
    nodes[0] = (X['rectal_temperature'] > 39.5)
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = (X['pulse'] > 100)
        prediction = 1 if nodes[1] else 0
    else:
        prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but in this case, if the first condition is false (temperature not high), the prediction is 0. If first is true and pulse >100, then 1 else 0. 

Alternatively, maybe the second node is a different condition if first is true. 

Alternatively, maybe the second node is on another feature like 'abdominal_distension' being severe. 

But given the constraints, I'll proceed with this structure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first node is 'abdominal_distension' being severe (code 3), then second node is 'nasogastric_reflux' being 0 (more than 1 liter). 

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0]*2
    nodes[0] = (X['abdominal_distension'] >= 3)  # severe (3) or moderate (1?) Wait, the codes are 1=moderate, 2=none, 3=severe, 4=slight. So severe is 3. So nodes[0] = X['abdominal_distension'] == 3

Wait, maybe better to check if it's >=3? Because 'severe' is 3, but 'moderate' is 1. So if the abdominal distension is moderate or severe, but perhaps severe is the critical one. 

Alternatively, nodes[0] = (X['abdominal_distension'] == 3)

Then second node could be 'nasogastric_reflux' ==0 (more than 1 liter).

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0]*2
    nodes[0] = (X['abdominal_distension'] == 3)
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = (X['nasogastric_reflux'] ==0)
        prediction = 1 if nodes[1] else 0
    else:
        prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes

This could also be a plausible decision.

Alternatively, maybe a more common approach would be to use lab values like PCV and protein. Let's try that again.

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0]*2
    nodes[0] = (X['packed_cell_volume'] > 45)
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = (X['abdomcentesis_total_protein'] > 3.5)
        prediction = 1 if nodes[1] else 0
    else:
        prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes

This uses two lab results which are critical for surgical decisions. 

Since abdomcentesis_total_protein over 3.5 g/dL is a high value, indicating possible peritoneal fluid abnormalities, which would necessitate surgery.

I think this might be a better structure. 

Therefore, I'll go with this structure.
