To build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 for classifying whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not, we first need to identify the most important features from the given set. Since the actual data and specific importance of each feature aren't provided, I'll use general knowledge about equine colic and common indicators for surgery to make an educated guess on feature selection.

For simplicity, let's consider the following as potentially highly indicative features:
1. **Degree of Pain** - Severe pain is often associated with surgical conditions.
2. **Abdominal Distension** - Moderate to severe distension can indicate a condition requiring surgical intervention.
3. **Nasogastric Reflux** - Significant reflux (>1 liter) can suggest intestinal obstruction, which may require surgery.

Given these features and aiming for a maximum depth of 2, here's a simplified decision tree:

|--- Degree of Pain == severe
||--- class: surgical
|--- Degree of Pain != severe
    |--- Abdominal Distension == moderate or severe
    ||--- class: surgical
    |--- Abdominal Distension == none or slight
        ||--- Nasogastric Reflux == >1 liter
        |||--- class: surgical
        ||--- Nasogastric Reflux != >1 liter
        |||--- class: not surgical

This decision tree is based on the following logic:
- **Severe pain** often necessitates immediate surgical intervention.
- If the pain is not severe, **moderate to severe abdominal distension** could indicate a condition requiring surgery, such as an obstruction or significant impaction.
- For cases without severe pain and minimal distension, **significant nasogastric reflux (>1 liter)** might suggest an intestinal obstruction that requires surgical correction.

Please note, this is a highly simplified example based on hypothetical importance of features. In real-world scenarios:
- The decision to operate should be made by a veterinarian considering all clinical findings.
- More advanced techniques (like machine learning algorithms) could provide more accurate predictions using larger datasets and feature selection methods.
- Each case of equine colic can present uniquely, requiring a comprehensive evaluation beyond the simplifications used here.

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree based on the provided features and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing the input features.

    Returns:
    prediction (int): 0 if no surgery, 1 if surgery.
    nodes (list): List of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check for severe pain
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] == 2 or X["pain"] == 5
    
    # Node 1: Check for moderate to severe abdominal distension and significant nasogastric reflux
    nodes[1] = (X["abdominal_distension"] == 1 or X["abdominal_distension"] == 3) and X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0
    
    # Make prediction based on the inner nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]

# Example usage
input_features = {
    "surgery": None,
    "Age": 0,
    "rectal_temperature": 38.5,
    "pulse": 40,
    "respiratory_rate": 20,
    "temp_extremities": 3,
    "peripheral_pulse": 2,
    "mucous_membranes": 4,
    "capillary_refill_time": 1,
    "pain": 5,
    "peristalsis": 4,
    "abdominal_distension": 2,
    "nasogastric_tube": 3,
    "nasogastric_reflux": 0,
    "nasogastric_reflux_PH": None,
    "rectal_examination": 4,
    "abdomen": 4,
    "packed_cell_volume": 40,
    "total_protein": 6.5,
    "abdominocentesis_appearance": 1,
    "abdomcentesis_total_protein": None,
    "outcome": 3,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(input_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Inner Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this code:

*   We define a function `predict` that takes a dictionary `X` containing the input features.
*   The function checks for severe pain (`pain == 2 or pain == 5`) and moderate to severe abdominal distension with significant nasogastric reflux (`abdominal_distension == 1 or abdominal_distension == 3` and `nasogastric_reflux == 0`).
*   Based on these conditions, the function makes a prediction (0 for no surgery, 1 for surgery) and returns it along with a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
*   We provide an example usage of the `predict` function with some sample input features.
