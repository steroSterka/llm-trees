To build a decision tree for classifying whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not based on the given features, we first need to select the most relevant features. Since the target variable (surgery yes/no) and its relationship with other variables are not explicitly provided in your query, I will simulate a selection process based on common practices in machine learning.

For simplicity, let's assume that the following features are among the most important for determining whether surgery is needed:
1. **Degree of Pain** - A severe degree of pain could indicate a need for immediate surgical intervention.
2. **Abdominal Distension** - Significant abdominal distension might require surgical relief.
3. **Nasogastric Reflux** - The presence and quantity of reflux can be indicative of intestinal obstruction or other conditions requiring surgery.
4. **Rectal Examination Findings** - Abnormal findings could suggest a need for surgical intervention.

Given these assumptions, here's a simplified decision tree:

1. **Degree of Pain**:
   - **Severe**: Indicates potential need for immediate relief, possibly through surgery.
     - Proceed to check **Abdominal Distension**.
       - **Moderate/Severe**: Suggests obstruction or significant issue that may require surgical intervention.
         - Check **Nasogastric Reflux**:
           - **>1 liter**: Indicates a high likelihood of intestinal obstruction, suggesting surgery.
             - Class: Surgical
           - **<1 liter or None**: May still require surgery based on other factors.
             - Proceed to check **Rectal Examination Findings**.
               - **Increased/Decreased/Absent**: Abnormal findings could necessitate surgical exploration.
                 - Class: Surgical
               - **Normal**: Could potentially be managed non-surgically, but clinical judgment is crucial.
                 - Class: Non-Surgical (with caution and further evaluation)
       - **None/Slight**: May not immediately suggest surgery unless other severe symptoms are present.
         - Check **Nasogastric Reflux**:
           - **>1 liter**: Still suggests potential need for surgical intervention due to possible obstruction.
             - Class: Surgical
           - **<1 liter or None**: Less likely to require immediate surgery, but depends on overall clinical picture.
             - Proceed to check **Rectal Examination Findings**.
               - **Increased/Decreased/Absent**: Indicates potential need for surgical evaluation.
                 - Class: Surgical
               - **Normal**: Likely non-surgical, with management focusing on supportive care and monitoring.
                 - Class: Non-Surgical
   - **Mild/Moderate/None**: Less indicative of immediate need for surgery without other severe symptoms.
     - Check **Abdominal Distension**:
       - **Moderate/Severe**: Could suggest obstruction or significant issues potentially requiring surgery.
         - Proceed as above, checking **Nasogastric Reflux** and then **Rectal Examination Findings** to determine the need for surgery.
       - **None/Slight**: Less likely to require surgery unless other critical symptoms are present.
         - Check **Nasogastric Reflux**:
           - **>1 liter**: Suggests potential obstruction, possibly requiring surgical intervention.
             - Class: Surgical
           - **<1 liter or None**: Likely non-surgical, focusing on supportive care and monitoring.
             - Proceed to check **Rectal Examination Findings** for confirmation:
               - **Normal**: Non-Surgical
               - **Abnormal**: Could necessitate surgical evaluation.

This simplified decision tree illustrates how one might approach categorizing horse colic cases as either surgical or non-surgical based on key clinical features. In practice, the actual decision would depend on a comprehensive evaluation of all provided features and potentially others not listed here, along with expert veterinary judgment. The complexity of real-world cases often requires nuanced consideration beyond what can be captured in a simplified tree.

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree based on the provided features and target variable. This function takes a dictionary `X` as input where keys are feature names and values are feature values.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list with None values
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if pain is severe (continuous severe pain or intermittent severe pain)
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]
    
    # Node 1: Check abdominal distension level (moderate or severe)
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] in [1, 3]
    
    # Node 2: Check nasogastric reflux level (more than 1 liter)
    nodes[2] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0
    
    # Node 3: Check rectal examination findings (abnormal)
    nodes[3] = X["rectal_examination"] in [1, 2]
    
    # Node 4: Check if pain is not severe and abdominal distension level is slight or none
    nodes[4] = X["pain"] not in [2, 5] and X["abdominal_distension"] in [2, 4]
    
    # Node 5: Check nasogastric reflux pH (assuming a threshold of 7)
    nodes[5] = X["nasogastric_reflux_PH"] < 7
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    elif nodes[1]:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    elif nodes[3]:
        prediction = 1
    elif nodes[4] and nodes[5]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 0
    
    # Convert boolean values to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) if isinstance(node, bool) else node for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
X = {
    "pain": 2,
    "abdominal_distension": 3,
    "nasogastric_reflux": 0,
    "rectal_examination": 1,
    "nasogastric_reflux_PH": 6.5,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)

```

This decision tree first checks if the pain is severe (Node 0). If it is, the function predicts that surgery is required (`prediction = 1`). 

If the pain is not severe, the function then checks for abdominal distension (Node 1), nasogastric reflux level (Node 2), and rectal examination findings (Node 3) to determine if surgery is necessary.

Finally, if none of these conditions are met, it checks a combination of non-severe pain with slight or no abdominal distension and low nasogastric reflux pH (Nodes 4 and 5). 

If any of the conditions that indicate surgery are met, `prediction` will be `1`; otherwise, it will be `0`. The function returns both the prediction and a list of nodes where each node represents a condition in the decision tree.
