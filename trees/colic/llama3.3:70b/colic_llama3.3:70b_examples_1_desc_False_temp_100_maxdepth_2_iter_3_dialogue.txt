To build a decision tree that classifies whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not with a maximum depth of 2, we'll use the provided features and outcome variable. Given the complexity and the number of features involved, the most straightforward approach to induce such a tree would involve selecting the most informative features related to the need for surgery in colic cases.

From clinical knowledge:
- **Degree of Pain** can be an indicator of the severity of the condition.
- **Abdominal Distension** is often associated with the need for surgical intervention due to potential obstruction or severe inflammation.
- **Nasogastric Reflux** and its volume can indicate intestinal obstruction, a common reason for surgery in colic cases.

Let's assume these are among the most important features based on clinical relevance. We'll simplify our decision tree to use these features with a maximum depth of 2, meaning we have one main split (at the root) and potential secondary splits.

Given the nature of the problem and without specific data to run through an algorithm like ID3 or C4.5 for precise feature selection and threshold determination, we'll create a logical decision tree based on clinical relevance:

1. **Root Node:** Abdominal Distension
   - This is chosen because severe abdominal distension can be indicative of conditions requiring surgical intervention (e.g., intestinal obstruction).

2. **Left Branch (Abdominal Distension: none or slight):**
   - In cases with minimal to no distension, the decision for surgery might depend on other factors such as the degree of pain and nasogastric reflux.
   - Secondary split: Degree of Pain
     - If the degree of pain is severe, this could indicate a need for surgical intervention due to potential for significant intestinal compromise or other severe conditions.

3. **Right Branch (Abdominal Distension: moderate or severe):**
   - In cases with significant distension, the concern for conditions requiring surgery (like obstruction) increases.
   - Secondary split: Nasogastric Reflux (>1 liter)
     - Significant nasogastric reflux can indicate intestinal obstruction, a common reason for surgical intervention in colic cases.

**Decision Tree:**

|--- Abdominal Distension <= slight
||--- Degree of Pain == severe -> class: Surgical
||--- Degree of Pain != severe -> class: Non-Surgical
|--- Abdominal Distension > slight
||--- Nasogastric Reflux > 1 liter -> class: Surgical
||--- Nasogastric Reflux <= 1 liter -> class: Non-Surgical

This tree is a simplified example based on clinical reasoning rather than actual data analysis. In practice, constructing such a tree would require analyzing specific data to determine the most predictive features and their thresholds accurately.

Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree based on the provided features and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values.
        - abdominal_distension: Abdominal Distension (1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight)
        - pain: Degree of Pain (1 = alert, 2 = continuous severe pain, 3 = depressed, 4 = intermittent mild pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain)
        - nasogastric_reflux: Nasogastric Reflux (0 = more then 1 liter, 1 = less then 1 liter, 2 = missing, 3 = none)

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
        - prediction (int): 0 if no surgery is needed, 1 if surgery is needed
        - nodes (list): A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes
    """

    # Initialize the nodes with None
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] in [1, 3]  # moderate or severe abdominal distension
    if not nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]  # continuous severe pain or intermittent severe pain
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0  # more than 1 liter of nasogastric reflux

    # Make the prediction based on the node values
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1 if nodes[1] else 1  # surgery is needed if there's significant abdominal distension and/or more than 1 liter of nasogastric reflux
    else:
        prediction = 1 if nodes[1] else 0  # surgery is needed if there's severe pain but no significant abdominal distension

    # Convert the node values to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

You can use this function by passing a dictionary with the feature values as follows:

```python
features = {
    "abdominal_distension": 3,  # severe abdominal distension
    "pain": 2,  # continuous severe pain
    "nasogastric_reflux": 0,  # more than 1 liter of nasogastric reflux
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 1
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: Nodes: [1, 1]
```
