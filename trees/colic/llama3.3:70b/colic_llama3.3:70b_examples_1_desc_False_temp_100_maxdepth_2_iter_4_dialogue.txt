To build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 for determining whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not, we first need to select the most important features from the provided list. The importance of features can be determined by their relevance and impact on the outcome (surgical vs. non-surgical). Since the actual dataset isn't provided, I'll use general medical knowledge to prioritize features that are commonly associated with the severity and type of colic in horses.

Important Features for Horse Colic:
1. **Degree of Pain** - Severe pain can indicate a more serious condition requiring surgical intervention.
2. **Abdominal Distension** - Significant distension is often associated with conditions needing surgery, like intestinal obstruction or volvulus.
3. **Nasogastric Reflux pH and Volume** - High volumes and abnormal pH levels can indicate gastrointestinal obstruction or other severe conditions.
4. **Rectal Examination Findings** - Abnormal findings can suggest a surgical lesion.

Given these features, here's a simplified decision tree with a maximum depth of 2:

- **Root Node**: Degree of Pain
  - **Degree of Pain = Severe**
    - **Left Child (Depth 1)**: Abdominal Distension
      - **Abdominal Distension = Moderate or Severe**: Surgical
      - **Abdominal Distension = None or Slight**: Non-Surgical
    - **Right Child (Depth 1)**: Not applicable due to severe pain already indicating potential for surgical intervention, but could consider Nasogastric Reflux Volume as an alternative split.
  - **Degree of Pain ≠ Severe** (Mild, Moderate, None)
    - **Left Child (Depth 1)**: Rectal Examination Findings
      - **Rectal Examination Findings = Increased or Decreased**: Non-Surgical
      - **Rectal Examination Findings = Absent or Normal but with other concerning signs like significant Nasogastric Reflux**: Could consider surgical evaluation but generally Non-Surgical

**Decision Tree:**

|--- Degree of Pain = Severe
||--- Abdominal Distension = Moderate or Severe: Surgical
||--- Abdominal Distension = None or Slight: Non-Surgical
|--- Degree of Pain ≠ Severe
||--- Rectal Examination Findings = Increased or Decreased: Non-Surgical
||--- Rectal Examination Findings = Absent or Normal but with concerning signs: Consider Surgical Evaluation, generally Non-Surgical

This decision tree is a simplification and should be validated with actual clinical data. The importance of features may vary depending on the dataset, and other features not listed here might also play critical roles in determining surgical need. A more accurate model would require training on a specific dataset to weigh the importance of each feature correctly.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not based on the provided features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the features of the horse colic case.
            - 'pain': Degree of Pain (1 = alert, 2 = continuous severe pain, 3 = depressed, 4 = intermittent mild pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain)
            - 'abdominal_distension': Abdominal Distension (1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight)
            - 'rectal_examination': Rectal Examination Findings (1 = absent, 2 = decreased, 3 = increased, 4 = normal)

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Node 0: Check if the degree of pain is severe (5 = intermittent severe pain or 2 = continuous severe pain)
    nodes[0] = X['pain'] in [2, 5]
    
    # Node 1: If the degree of pain is not severe, check if the abdominal distension is moderate or severe
    nodes[1] = X['abdominal_distension'] in [1, 3]

    prediction = 0  # Initialize prediction as no surgery

    if nodes[0]:
        # If the degree of pain is severe, predict surgery
        prediction = 1
    else:
        # If the degree of pain is not severe, check the abdominal distension
        if nodes[1]:
            # If the abdominal distension is moderate or severe, predict surgery
            prediction = 1

    # Convert boolean values to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes


# Example usage:
X = {
    'pain': 5,  # intermittent severe pain
    'abdominal_distension': 3,  # severe
    'rectal_examination': 4  # normal
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 1
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: Nodes: [1, 1]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features of the horse colic case and returns a tuple with the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a sample input dictionary `X`.
