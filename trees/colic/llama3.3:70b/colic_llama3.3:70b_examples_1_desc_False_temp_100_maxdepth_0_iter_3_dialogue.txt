To induce a decision tree classifier for determining whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not, we need to select the most relevant features that contribute significantly to this classification. Given the extensive list of features provided, we will focus on those directly related to the severity and nature of colic symptoms, as well as outcomes that could indicate a need for surgical intervention.

Here's a step-by-step approach to building a simplified decision tree:

1. **Feature Selection**: Identify critical features that are most closely associated with the decision to perform surgery in horse colic cases. These might include:
   - Degree of Pain
   - Abdominal Distension
   - Nasogastric Reflux (volume and pH)
   - Rectal Examination Findings
   - Abdominocentesis Appearance and Total Protein

2. **Decision Tree Construction**: We will construct a decision tree based on these selected features, considering the surgery outcome as our target variable.

**Simplified Decision Tree:**

|--- Degree of Pain == severe
||--- Abdominal Distension == severe
|||--- class: surgical
||--- Abdominal Distension < severe
|||--- Nasogastric Reflux > 1 liter or pH significantly abnormal
||||--- class: surgical
||||--- Nasogastric Reflux <= 1 liter and pH near normal
|||||--- Rectal Examination Findings == increased or absent
||||||--- class: surgical
||||||--- Rectal Examination Findings == normal or decreased
|||||||--- Abdominocentesis Appearance == serosanguinous
||||||||--- class: surgical
||||||||--- Abdominocentesis Appearance != serosanguinous
|||||||||--- class: non-surgical

|--- Degree of Pain < severe
||--- Abdominal Distension == moderate or severe
|||--- Nasogastric Reflux > 1 liter or pH significantly abnormal
||||--- class: surgical
||||--- Nasogastric Reflux <= 1 liter and pH near normal
|||||--- Rectal Examination Findings == increased or absent
||||||--- class: surgical
||||||--- Rectal Examination Findings == normal or decreased
|||||||--- Abdominocentesis Appearance == serosanguinous
||||||||--- class: surgical
||||||||--- Abdominocentesis Appearance != serosanguinous
|||||||||--- class: non-surgical
||--- Abdominal Distension < moderate
|||--- Rectal Examination Findings == increased or absent
||||--- class: non-surgical (monitor closely)
||||--- Rectal Examination Findings == normal or decreased
|||||--- class: non-surgical

This simplified decision tree focuses on key clinical indicators that often necessitate surgical intervention in equine colic cases, such as severe pain, significant abdominal distension, high volumes of nasogastric reflux with abnormal pH, abnormal rectal examination findings, and serosanguinous abdominocentesis fluid. The tree is structured to prioritize the most critical conditions first and then consider less severe presentations that might still require close monitoring or surgical evaluation.

**Note**: This decision tree is a hypothetical example based on general knowledge of equine colic management and may not reflect the optimal strategy for every case. In real-world veterinary practice, decisions regarding surgery are made after thorough examination, consideration of multiple factors, and often in consultation with specialists.

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree based on the provided features and target variable.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing the features of the horse colic case.
    
    Returns:
    prediction (int): 0 if the lesion is not surgical, 1 if it is surgical.
    nodes (list): List representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """
    
    # Initialize the list to store node truth values
    nodes = [None] * 7
    
    # Node 0: Degree of Pain == severe (continuous severe pain)
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] == 2
    
    # Node 1: Abdominal Distension == severe
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 3
    
    # Node 2: Nasogastric Reflux > 1 liter or pH significantly abnormal (pH < 6)
    nodes[2] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0 or X["nasogastric_reflux_PH"] < 6
    
    # Node 3: Rectal Examination Findings == increased or absent
    nodes[3] = X["rectal_examination"] in [1, 3]
    
    # Node 4: Abdominocentesis Appearance == serosanguinous
    nodes[4] = X["abdominocentesis_appearance"] == 3
    
    # Node 5: Severe pain and significant abdominal distension
    nodes[5] = nodes[0] and nodes[1]
    
    # Node 6: Significant nasogastric reflux or abnormal rectal examination findings
    nodes[6] = nodes[2] or nodes[3]
    
    # Make the prediction based on the node values
    if nodes[5]:
        prediction = 1
    elif nodes[0] and (nodes[2] or nodes[4]):
        prediction = 1
    elif nodes[1] and nodes[6]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 0
    
    # Convert boolean node values to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
features = {
    "pain": 2,
    "abdominal_distension": 3,
    "nasogastric_reflux": 0,
    "nasogastric_reflux_PH": 5.5,
    "rectal_examination": 1,
    "abdominocentesis_appearance": 3
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Node values:", nodes)

```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features of the horse colic case and returns a tuple with two elements: `prediction` (an integer indicating whether the lesion is surgical or not) and `nodes` (a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree). The node values are initially boolean, but they are converted to integers (1 for True, 0 for False) before being returned.
