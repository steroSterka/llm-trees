Okay, I understand. You want me to act as a decision tree induction algorithm, building a tree to classify horse colic lesions as surgical or not, with a maximum depth of 2.  I will prioritize features based on a *simulated* information gain (since I don't have actual data to calculate it). I'll make reasonable assumptions about which features are more likely to be discriminative.  I will also use a bit of domain knowledge (horse colic is a severe condition and certain clinical signs are strongly indicative of surgery).

Here's the decision tree I will construct, along with the reasoning.  I'll explain my choices.

**Decision Tree for Horse Colic – Surgical vs. Non-Surgical (Max Depth 2)**

```
|--- **Degree of Pain** <= Moderate
||--- **Pulse** > 60 bpm 
|||--- Class: Non-Surgical
|||--- Class: Surgical
|--- **Degree of Pain** > Moderate
||--- **Rectal Temperature (°C)** > 38.5 °C
|||--- Class: Surgical
|||--- Class: Non-Surgical
```

**Reasoning & Feature Selection:**

1.  **Root Node: Degree of Pain:** This is, in my estimation, the most crucial initial split.  Severe pain is *strongly* correlated with surgical colic.  Horses with mild or moderate pain are more likely to respond to medical management.

2.  **First Split: Pulse:**  After determining degree of pain, I chose to measure pulse to see if the horse has a good blood supply. Horses with high pulses are more likely to need surgery.

3.  **Second Split: Rectal Temperature (°C):** Temperature is a key indicator of inflammation and sepsis. High temperature may indicate an infection that needs surgical treatment.

**Important Considerations & Limitations:**

*   **No Actual Data:** This tree is built on *my* assumptions about feature importance based on veterinary knowledge.  A real implementation would use a dataset to calculate information gain or Gini impurity and determine the best splits.
*   **Maximum Depth:**  The depth of 2 limits the complexity of the tree. In a real scenario, a deeper tree might achieve better accuracy but risk overfitting.
*   **Missing Values:** I haven't addressed how to handle missing values in the features.
*   **Feature Interactions:** This tree only considers single feature splits. More complex decision trees can consider interactions between features.
*   **Class Imbalance:** If the dataset had a significantly different number of surgical vs. non-surgical cases, this tree might be biased towards the majority class.

**How to improve this tree if I had data:**

1.  **Information Gain/Gini Impurity:** Calculate these metrics for each feature at each potential split point to determine the best split.
2.  **Cross-Validation:** Use cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the tree and prevent overfitting.
3.  **Pruning:** Prune the tree to reduce complexity and improve generalization.
4.  **Feature Engineering:** Create new features from existing ones to potentially improve accuracy.

Let me know if you'd like me to:

*   Explain any of these choices in more detail.
*   Suggest alternative trees with different root nodes.
*   Discuss how to handle missing values.
*   Explore the implications of class imbalance.

            else:
                prediction = 1 #likely surgery even without high temp
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Likely no surgery
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Likely no surgery


    return prediction, nodes
```

Key improvements and explanations:

*   **Clearer Node Logic:** The code directly implements the decision tree described in the prompt.  The `if/else` statements follow the tree structure explicitly.
*   **Node Values:** The `nodes` list stores the boolean values (True/False) of each inner node's condition.  This aligns with the requested output format.
*   **Meaningful Thresholds:** I've used threshold values of 60 for `pulse` and 38.5 for `rectal_temperature` based on veterinary knowledge.  These values are more likely to be clinically relevant.  I also set pain threshold to >2 based on the feature description.
*   **Comments:** I've added comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code.
*   **Handles all paths:** The code now handles the all the cases of the decision tree.

**Example Usage:**

```python
horse_data = {
    "pain": 2,
    "pulse": 70,
    "rectal_temperature": 39.0
}

prediction, node_values = predict(horse_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Node Values: {node_values}")
```
This will print the prediction (0 or 1) and the list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
