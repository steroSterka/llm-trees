Alright, I need to help the user build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 to determine if a horse's colic condition is surgical. The features provided are quite extensive, so first, I should figure out which ones are most relevant.

Looking at the list, some features stand out as critical indicators for surgery. Rectal Temperature seems important because abnormal temperatures can indicate infections or inflammation. Next, Degree of Pain is crucial because severe pain often necessitates surgical intervention. These two features seem like the best starting points.

I'll start by splitting the data based on Rectal Temperature. If it's above 38.5°C, that suggests fever, which might mean surgery is needed. Then, for temperatures below or equal to 38.5°C, I'll look at the Degree of Pain. Moderate or severe pain likely means surgery, while none or mild might not require it.

This structure keeps the tree simple with a maximum depth of two, making it easy to interpret and practical for veterinarians to use quickly.

To build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 that determines whether a horse's colic condition is surgical or not based on the provided features, we will prioritize the most important features. The final classification will be binary: **surgical** (yes) or **non-surgical** (no). Below is the induced decision tree:

---

### Decision Tree:
|--- Rectal Temperature (°C) > 38.5
||--- class: **surgical**
|--- Rectal Temperature (°C) <= 38.5
||--- Degree of Pain == severe
|||--- class: **surgical**
||--- Degree of Pain != severe
||||--- class: **non-surgical**

---

### Explanation:
1. **Root Node**: The first split is based on **Rectal Temperature (°C)**, which is a critical indicator of potential systemic infection or inflammation that may require surgical intervention.
   - If the horse's rectal temperature exceeds 38.5°C, it suggests fever or severe inflammation, leading to a classification of **surgical**.
2. For cases where the rectal temperature is normal (<= 38.5°C), the tree evaluates the **Degree of Pain**, as pain severity is a key determinant of surgical need:
   - If the degree of pain is **severe**, it indicates a serious underlying condition that likely requires surgery (**surgical**).
   - If the degree of pain is **none, mild, or moderate**, the condition is classified as **non-surgical**.

This decision tree prioritizes two of the most critical features for determining surgical intervention in equine colic cases: rectal temperature and pain severity. The maximum depth of 2 ensures simplicity while maintaining practical utility.

Okay, so I need to create a Python function that predicts whether a horse's colic lesion is surgical or not based on the given features. The decision tree should have a maximum depth of 2, which means it can't have more than two levels of conditions after the initial split.

First, I'll look at the features provided and identify which ones are most important for determining if surgery is needed. From the previous example, rectal temperature and degree of pain were used as the main factors. Rectal temperature seems crucial because a high temperature could indicate an infection or severe inflammation that might require surgical intervention. Degree of pain also makes sense because severe pain can be a sign of a serious underlying issue.

Next, I need to map these features into their respective variables in the provided feature list. For rectal temperature, it's straightforward—it’s already measured in degrees Celsius. For degree of pain, the encoding is a bit more complex: 1 for alert, 2 for continuous severe pain, 3 for depressed, 4 for intermittent mild pain, and 5 for intermittent severe pain. So, I'll need to check if the value corresponds to 'severe' pain, which seems to be represented by values 2 or 5 based on the description.

Now, setting up the decision tree:

1. **First Node (Root):** Check if rectal temperature is greater than a certain threshold. From the previous example, they used 38.5°C as the cutoff. So, I'll use that as well because it seems like a reasonable threshold indicating fever or severe inflammation.

2. **Second Layer:**
   - If rectal temperature > 38.5°C, classify as surgical (1).
   - Else, check the degree of pain:
     - If degree of pain is severe (let's say value == 2 or 5), classify as surgical (1).
     - Otherwise, classify as non-surgical (0).

I need to format this logic into a Python function that takes a dictionary `X` containing all the features and returns both the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The list should have 1 if the condition is met and 0 otherwise.

Let me outline the steps within the function:

- Extract rectal temperature and degree of pain from the input dictionary.
- Check if rectal temperature exceeds 38.5°C. This will be the first node.
- If yes, set prediction to 1 (surgical) and update the nodes list accordingly.
- If no, check the degree of pain. Determine if it's severe based on the predefined values.
- Update the second node with whether the degree of pain is severe.
- Return the final prediction and the nodes list.

I also need to ensure that the keys used in the function match exactly those provided, paying attention to spelling and case sensitivity. For example, 'rectal_temperature' is the key for rectal temperature, and 'pain' corresponds to the degree of pain.

Testing this function with sample data would help verify its accuracy. I should consider different scenarios:
- High rectal temperature leading to a surgical prediction.
- Normal rectal temperature but severe pain leading to surgery.
- Normal rectal temperature and non-severe pain leading to non-surgical.

Finally, I'll write the code, making sure it's clean and well-commented for clarity. This will help anyone reviewing or using the function understand how predictions are made based on the decision tree logic.

Here is a Python function that implements the decision tree to predict whether a horse's colic lesion requires surgery, along with an explanation of the process:

```python
def predict_colic_surgery(X):
    """
    Predicts if a horse's colic lesion is surgical based on rectal temperature and degree of pain.
    
    Args:
        X (dict): Dictionary containing the features for the horse.
        
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of boolean values representing the inner nodes' conditions.
    """
    
    # Initialize nodes to track the conditions
    nodes = [None, None]
    
    # Extract relevant features from the input dictionary
    rectal_temp = X['rectal_temperature']
    pain_level = X['pain']
    
    # First condition: Check if rectal temperature exceeds 38.5°C
    temp_condition = rectal_temp > 38.5
    nodes[0] = int(temp_condition)  # Convert boolean to 1 (True) or 0 (False)
    
    prediction = 0  # Default to non-surgical
    
    if temp_condition:
        prediction = 1  # Surgical due to high temperature
    else:
        # Determine severe pain based on predefined values
        severe_pain = pain_level in [2, 5]
        nodes[1] = int(severe_pain)  # Update the second node
        
        if severe_pain:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical due to severe pain
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
# horse_features = {
#     'rectal_temperature': 39.0,
#     'pain': 2
# }
# prediction, nodes = predict_colic_surgery(horse_features)
# print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `predict_colic_surgery` takes a dictionary `X` containing the horse's features as input.

2. **Feature Extraction**: It extracts 'rectal_temperature' and 'pain' from the input dictionary, which are crucial for determining the need for surgery.

3. **First Condition (Root Node)**: The function checks if the rectal temperature exceeds 38.5°C. If true, it sets `temp_condition` to `True`, indicating a potential surgical case due to high fever or inflammation.

4. **Second Layer Conditions**: 
   - If the temperature condition is met (`True`), the prediction is set to 1 (surgical).
   - If not, the function evaluates the degree of pain. Severe pain is identified by specific values (2 or 5 in this case).

5. **Prediction and Nodes**: The function returns a tuple with the final prediction (0 for non-surgical, 1 for surgical) and a list `nodes` where each element represents whether the condition at that node was met (1 for `True`, 0 for `False`).

6. **Example Usage**: Demonstrates how to use the function with sample features and print the results.

This implementation ensures that the decision-making process is clear, efficient, and aligns with the maximum depth constraint of 2 levels after the root node.
