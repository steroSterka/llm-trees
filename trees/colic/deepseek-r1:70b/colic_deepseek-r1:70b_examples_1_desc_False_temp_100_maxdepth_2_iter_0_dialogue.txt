Alright, so I need to build a decision tree classifier that determines whether a horse's colic lesion is surgical or not. The user provided a list of features and an example from the Iris dataset, which helps me understand how they want the tree structured. They also specified a maximum depth of 2, meaning the tree can't have more than two levels of decisions.

First, I'll look at the features available:

1. Surgery (yes / no) - But wait, this seems like it might be the target variable since we're trying to predict if surgery is needed. So maybe that's not a feature but the outcome. The user listed "Outcome" separately as lived/died/euthanized, so perhaps "Surgery" is an input feature? Or maybe it's part of the outcome. I need to clarify this. But since it's in the features list, I'll assume it's an input.

2. Age (adult / young)
3. Rectal Temperature (°C)
4. Pulse (beats per minute)
5. Respiratory Rate (breaths per minute)
6. Temperature of Extremities (normal / warm / cool / cold)
7. Strength of Peripheral Pulse (normal / increased / reduced / absent)
8. Appearance of Mucous Membranes (normal pink / bright pink / pale pink / pale cyanotic / bright red / dark cyanotic)
9. Capillary Refill Time (< 3 seconds / >= 3 seconds)
10. Degree of Pain (none / mild / moderate / severe)
11. Peristalsis (hypermotile / normal / hypomotile / absent)
12. Abdominal Distension (none / slight / moderate / severe)
13. Nasogastric Tube (none / slight / significant)
14. Nasogastric Reflux (none / >1 liter / <1 liter)
15. Nasogastric Reflux pH
16. Rectal Examination Findings (normal / increased / decreased / absent)
17. Abdomen Appearance (normal / other / feces in the large intestine / distended small intestine / distended large intestine)
18. Packed Cell Volume (%)
19. Total Protein (g/dl)
20. Abdominocentesis Appearance (clear / cloudy / serosanguinous)
21. Abdominocentesis Total Protein (g/dl)
22. Outcome (lived / died / euthanized)

Wait, the target variable is whether the lesion is surgical or not, which I assume means predicting "Surgery" as yes or no. So the features are all these other variables except "Outcome," which might be used in training but isn't a feature.

Since we have to build a tree with max depth 2, we'll choose two most important features. I need to figure out which features are most predictive of surgical vs non-surgical colic.

Looking at the list, some features stand out:

- Rectal Temperature: High temperature could indicate infection or severe inflammation needing surgery.
- Degree of Pain: Severe pain might necessitate surgical intervention.
- Abdominal Distension: Significant distension can be a sign of obstruction requiring surgery.
- Nasogastric Reflux: Large amounts could indicate severe issues like stomach rupture, needing surgery.
- Capillary Refill Time: Slow refill suggests poor circulation, maybe shock, which is serious.
- Peristalsis: Absent peristalsis indicates ileus, which might require surgery if not resolving.

But since I can only choose two features for a max depth of 2 tree, I need to pick the top two. In equine colic, rectal temperature and abdominal distension are commonly used as critical indicators. High fever suggests infection, and severe distension is a sign of possible obstruction or rupture.

So first split: Rectal Temperature > 38.5°C (normal for horses is around 37.5-38.5). If it's higher, that might indicate surgical need because of potential infection or severe inflammation.

Second feature: Abdominal Distension. Severe distension often points to conditions requiring surgery like colon torsion or perforation.

So the tree would first check temperature. If above threshold, classify as surgical. Else, check abdominal distension; if severe, surgical, else non-surgical.

I think that's a logical approach given the features and maximum depth constraint.

Based on the analysis of the provided features and their relevance to determining whether a horse's colic lesion is surgical or not, we can construct a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. The two most important features identified are "Rectal Temperature (°C)" and "Abdominal Distension." These were chosen due to their critical role in indicating severe conditions that may necessitate surgery.

### Decision Tree:

|--- Rectal Temperature (°C) > 38.5
||--- class: Surgical
|--- Rectal Temperature (°C) <= 38.5
||--- Abdominal Distension == Severe
||||--- class: Surgical
||--- Abdominal Distension != Severe
||||--- class: Non-Surgical

This tree first assesses the rectal temperature, a key indicator of potential infection or severe inflammation. If the temperature exceeds 38.5°C, it suggests a surgical need. If not, the tree then evaluates the severity of abdominal distension, as severe cases often require surgical intervention.

Okay, so I'm trying to help this person create a Python function that predicts whether a horse's colic lesion is surgical or not based on certain features. They've already provided an example of how they want the decision tree to look and how it should be translated into a function. My task is to take their existing decision tree and turn it into a function that returns both a prediction (0 for no surgery, 1 for surgery) and a list of truth values representing the inner nodes of the tree.

First, I need to understand their decision tree structure. They have two main features: Rectal Temperature and Abdominal Distension. The tree first checks if the rectal temperature is greater than 38.5°C. If it is, then it's classified as surgical (1). If not, it moves on to check the abdominal distension. If the distension is severe, it's also classified as surgical; otherwise, it's non-surgical.

Now, looking at the features and their encodings provided:

- Rectal Temperature is a continuous value in degrees Celsius.
- Abdominal Distension has four possible categories: moderate (1), none (2), severe (3), slight (4).

In the example function they provided, they used thresholds for HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level to create boolean conditions stored in nodes. The prediction is based on these nodes.

So, I need to translate their decision tree into similar condition checks.

First step: Define the nodes list with two elements since the tree has a maximum depth of 2. Each node will represent a condition.

Node 0: Check if rectal_temperature > 38.5. This will be True or False.
Node 1: Check if abdominal_distension == severe, which is encoded as 3 in the features.

Next, the prediction logic:

- If Node 0 is True (rectal temperature exceeds threshold), predict 1 (surgery needed).
- Else, check Node 1:
  - If Node 1 is True (abdominal distension is severe), predict 1.
  - Else, predict 0.

I need to make sure that the function correctly maps these conditions and returns both the prediction and the nodes as a list of integers (1 for True, 0 for False).

Wait, in their example, they used 1 for True and 0 for False. So I should convert the boolean values of the nodes to integers accordingly.

Also, I need to ensure that all feature keys are correctly referenced in the function according to the provided list. For instance, 'rectal_temperature' is one of the keys, so I'll use X['rectal_temperature'] and compare it to 38.5.

Similarly, for abdominal_distension, since severe is encoded as 3, I'll check if X['abdominal_distension'] == 3.

Putting this together:

- Node 0: X['rectal_temperature'] > 38.5
- Node 1: X['abdominal_distension'] == 3

Then, the prediction logic follows as per the tree.

I also need to make sure that all possible cases are covered and that there's no ambiguity in the conditions. For example, if rectal temperature is exactly 38.5°C, it falls into the else clause.

Testing this function with sample data would be good to ensure it behaves as expected, but since I'm just writing the code, I'll focus on correctly translating the logic.

I think that's about it. Time to write the function accordingly.
</think>

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting whether a horse's colic lesion is surgical or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2
    
    # First inner node condition: Rectal Temperature > 38.5°C
    nodes[0] = X['rectal_temperature'] > 38.5
    
    # Second inner node condition: Abdominal Distension is severe (encoded as 3)
    nodes[1] = X['abdominal_distension'] == 3
    
    # Convert boolean values to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **Nodes List**: The function initializes a list `nodes` with two elements to store the boolean results of the inner node conditions.
  
- **Condition Checks**:
  - `nodes[0]`: Evaluates if the rectal temperature is greater than 38.5°C.
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the abdominal distension is severe (encoded as 3).
  
- **Conversion to Integers**: The boolean values in `nodes` are converted to integers, where `True` becomes 1 and `False` becomes 0.

- **Prediction Logic**:
  - If the first condition (`nodes[0]`) is true, the prediction is 1 (surgery needed).
  - Otherwise, it checks the second condition (`nodes[1]`). If true, the prediction is 1; otherwise, it's 0.

This function accurately represents the decision tree logic and provides both a prediction and the evaluation of inner nodes.
