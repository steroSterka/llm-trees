Alright, so I'm trying to build a decision tree classifier to determine whether a horse with colic should be classified as surgical or not. The user provided a list of features and wants the tree to have a maximum depth of 2. From their example using Iris dataset features, they used petal width (cm) as the primary split, so I need to do something similar but with the given equine colic features.

First, I should identify which feature is the most important for determining if the case is surgical or not. Looking at the list of features, some stand out as critical indicators in veterinary medicine. For example, 'Degree of Pain' seems crucial because severe pain can indicate a need for surgery. Also, 'Abdominal Distension' is another significant factor since severe distension might necessitate surgical intervention.

I'll start by selecting 'Degree of Pain' as the first split because it's a direct indicator of the horse's condition. If the degree of pain is severe, that likely points towards a surgical case. For cases where pain isn't severe, I need another feature to further split the data. Here, 'Abdominal Distension' comes into play. Severe distension in these non-severe pain cases would suggest surgery.

I should make sure the tree doesn't exceed depth 2, so each branch only splits once more after the initial split. That way, the structure remains simple and adheres to the user's constraints.

So, structuring it out:
- First, check if Degree of Pain is severe. If yes, classify as Surgical.
- If not severe, then check Abdominal Distension. If it's severe, classify as Surgical; otherwise, Medical.

This approach uses two levels of splits with important features to make an accurate classification without overcomplicating the tree.

### Decision Tree for Horse Colic Lesion Classification (Surgical or Not)

```markdown
|--- Degree of Pain <= severe
||--- class: Surgical
|--- Degree of Pain > severe
||--- Abdominal Distension <= severe
||||--- class: Surgical
||--- Abdominal Distension > severe
||||--- class: Medical
```

### Explanation:
1. **First Split**: The tree splits based on the `Degree of Pain`, with a threshold at "severe".
   - If the degree of pain is "severe", the case is classified as **Surgical**.
2. **Second Split (if Degree of Pain > severe)**: The tree further splits based on `Abdominal Distension`.
   - If the abdominal distension is "severe", the case is classified as **Surgical**.
   - If the abdominal distension is less than "severe", the case is classified as **Medical**.

This decision tree uses two of the most important features (`Degree of Pain` and `Abdominal Distension`) to classify whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not, with a maximum depth of 2.

Okay, I need to create a Python function based on the decision tree provided for classifying whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not. The decision tree uses "Degree of Pain" and "Abdominal Distension" as the main features.

First, looking at the target variable encoding: the target is 0 for no surgery and 1 for surgery. So, the function should return either 0 or 1 based on these conditions.

The user provided an example function where they used two nodes to store boolean values representing whether each condition was met. Each node corresponds to a split in the decision tree. For this problem, I have two splits: first on "Degree of Pain" and then on "Abdominal Distension."

From the feature encoding details:
- "pain" is encoded as 1 for alert, 2 for continuous severe pain, 3 for depressed, 4 for intermittent mild pain, and 5 for intermittent severe pain.
- "abdominal_distension" is encoded as 1 for moderate, 2 for none, 3 for severe, 4 for slight.

In the decision tree:
- The first split checks if "Degree of Pain" is <= severe. Since "severe" corresponds to code 5 in the encoding, I think we need to see what value represents "severe." Wait, looking back, the pain levels are from 1 to 5, with higher numbers indicating more severe pain. So, "severe" would be code 2 (continuous severe pain) and code 5 (intermittent severe pain). Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait no, the description says:
pain: Degree of Pain (1 = alert, 2 = continuous severe pain, 3 = depressed, 4 = intermittent mild pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain)

So "severe" is represented by codes 2 and 5. But in the decision tree, the split is at "severe," which might mean if the pain is less than or equal to severe.

But the function needs to map this correctly. If we consider that any value >= 2 indicates some level of severe pain, then perhaps the condition would be X["pain"] <= 5 (since all are forms of pain). That doesn't make sense because all entries would satisfy it.

Wait no, in the decision tree:
- First split: if Degree of Pain <= severe, classify as Surgical.
- Else, check Abdominal Distension.

So we need to find what value of "pain" corresponds to "severe." Given the encoding, I think "continuous severe pain" is code 2 and "intermittent severe pain" is code 5. So perhaps the threshold is if pain <=5? That would include all cases where pain is up to severe.

Wait that can't be right because in the decision tree, if it's <= severe, it's Surgical, else, check Abdominal Distension.

So perhaps the condition should be X["pain"] >=2 (since 2 is continuous severe and above), but no, the user example used thresholds like "HbA1c_level" <=6.7.

Alternatively, maybe in the dataset, higher numerical values represent more severe pain, so if we set a threshold where anything greater than or equal to 2 is considered severe.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to check for specific codes that indicate surgical conditions based on "pain."

Wait, according to the decision tree provided earlier:

Decision Tree:
|--- Degree of Pain <= severe
||--- class: Surgical
|--- Degree of Pain > severe
||--- Abdominal Distension <= severe
||||--- class: Surgical
||--- Abdominal Distension > severe
||||--- class: Medical

But in the feature encoding, "severe" could correspond to specific codes. Let me see:

pain: 1=alert, 2=continuous severe pain, 3=depressed, 4=intermittent mild pain, 5=intermittent severe pain.

So "Degree of Pain <= severe" would include all cases where pain is up to 5 (since both 2 and 5 are severe). But that seems like it might not make sense because the tree implies some hierarchy. Maybe the actual threshold in terms of numerical values needs to be determined based on data, but since I don't have the data, I'll proceed with what's given.

Perhaps for simplicity, we can set the condition as X["pain"] >=2 (indicating any form of severe pain). But again, this is a bit ambiguous without more information.

Similarly, "Abdominal Distension" has codes: 1=moderate, 2=none, 3=severe, 4=slight.

In the decision tree:
- If Abdominal Distension <= severe (which would be code 3), classify as Surgical.
- Else, Medical.

Wait no, in the tree, if Degree of Pain > severe, then check if Abdominal Distension is <= severe. So perhaps the condition should be X["abdominal_distension"] <=3 (since 1=moderate and 3=severe). But wait, moderate is more than none but less than severe.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to represent it as a numerical comparison based on the codes. For example, in terms of severity, higher numbers mean more severe? Or does the encoding not necessarily reflect that?

Given the feature encoding for "abdominal_distension": 1=moderate, 2=none, 3=severe, 4=slight.

This is a bit confusing because typically 'severe' would be higher than 'moderate.' Here, moderate=1, severe=3. So perhaps in the function, "abdominal_distension" <=3 includes moderate (1) and severe (3), which might not make sense because moderate is less severe than severe.

Wait, no, according to the tree:

|--- Degree of Pain > severe
||--- Abdominal Distension <= severe
||||--- class: Surgical
||--- Abdominal Distension > severe
||||--- class: Medical

So if after pain is more than severe, check if abdominal distension is less than or equal to severe. So in terms of codes, since severe is 3, "abdominal_distension" <=3 would include moderate (1) and severe (3). But 'severe' is already the highest category before 'Medical.' Wait, but code=4 is 'slight,' which might be less than 'moderate.'

This is confusing because the numerical codes don't necessarily align with the severity order.

Given this ambiguity, perhaps it's better to set up the conditions based on the actual string values rather than their encoded integers. But since the function uses the feature keys and their encoded values, I have to stick with numerical comparisons.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me proceed by defining:

For "pain": if X["pain"] <=5 (since 5 is intermittent severe pain), which would include all cases where pain is up to severe. But that seems incorrect because higher values indicate more severe pain, so perhaps the condition should be X["pain"] >=2 (indicating any form of severe pain).

Similarly for "abdominal_distension": if X["abdominal_distension"] <=3 (meaning moderate or severe), classify as Surgical.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's better to represent it as:

nodes[0] = X["pain"] >=2  # considering severe pain or worse
nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] <=3  # considering up to severe distension

Then, the prediction logic follows.

But I think this is getting too convoluted without clear thresholds. Perhaps I should make educated guesses based on typical decision tree structures and the given encodings.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2
    
    # Check if Degree of Pain is <= severe (encoded as pain <=5)
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] >= 2  # Assuming severe pain starts at code 2
    
    # Check if Abdominal Distension is <= severe (encoded as abdominal_distension <=3)
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 3  # Including moderate (1) and severe (3)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Surgical
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Medical
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **Feature Encoding:**
  - `pain`: 2 (continuous severe pain) and above are considered for surgical evaluation.
  - `abdominal_distension`: Codes 1 (moderate) and 3 (severe) indicate conditions that may require surgery.

- **Decision Logic:**
  - If the horse exhibits severe or worse pain (`nodes[0]` is True), it is classified as requiring surgery.
  - If not, the function checks if abdominal distension is moderate or severe (`nodes[1]` is True). If so, it is classified as surgical; otherwise, it is medical.

- **Output:**
  - The function returns a prediction (0 for no surgery, 1 for surgery) and a list of boolean values indicating whether each condition was met.
