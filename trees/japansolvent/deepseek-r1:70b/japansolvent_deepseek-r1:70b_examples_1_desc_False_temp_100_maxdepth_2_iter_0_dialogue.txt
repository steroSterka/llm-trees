Okay, so the user wants me to build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2. They provided some features related to financial metrics, and they want to classify whether a company is solvent or not. 

First, I need to understand what each feature represents. The features given are ratios like EBIT/Total Assets, Net Income/Total Capital, Sales/Total Assets, EBIT/Sales, Net Income/Sales, Working Capital/Total Assets, Equity/Total Liabilities, and Equity/Total Assets.

I remember that for decision trees, selecting the right splitting feature is crucial. Since the tree can't go deeper than level 2, I have to choose the most important features carefully at each split.

Let me think about which financial ratios are strong indicators of a company's solvency. EBIT/Total Assets shows how efficiently assets are used to generate earnings. If this ratio is high, it might indicate good profitability and thus solvency. On the other hand, if it's low, the company might be struggling.

Next, I should consider what makes sense as the second split. Maybe Net Income/Sales? It measures how much of each sale turns into profit. A higher ratio here would mean better profitability, which is another good sign of solvency.

Alternatively, Equity/Total Liabilities could be a good secondary feature because it shows the company's ability to cover liabilities with equity, indicating financial stability.

Wait, but I need to ensure that the tree doesn't go beyond depth 2. So, after splitting on EBIT/Total Assets, each subsequent node should only split once more based on another feature.

I think starting with EBIT/Total Assets makes sense because it's a key profitability metric. Then, using Net Income/Sales as the next level would add another layer of profit analysis. 

Let me structure this. If EBIT/TA is high (> 0.15), maybe the company is solvent. If not, then check if Net Income/Sales is above a certain threshold (say, >0.10). If yes, then solvent; otherwise, insolvent.

But I'm not sure about the exact thresholds. Maybe I should think about typical ranges for these ratios. For example, an EBIT/TA of 0.15 might be a reasonable cutoff. Similarly, Net Income/Sales above 0.10 could indicate positive profitability.

I also need to ensure that this makes logical sense. Companies with higher EBIT/TA are generally more profitable and thus solvent. If they don't meet the first condition but have good net income relative to sales, they might still be solvent because they're managing their expenses well.

Alternatively, I could use Equity/Total Liabilities as the second feature. High equity relative to liabilities indicates a strong financial position. But maybe Net Income/Sales is more directly tied to profitability and solvency.

I should probably go with EBIT/TA as the first split since it's a comprehensive measure of profitability relative to assets, and then use Net Income/Sales for the second level because it focuses on net profitability from sales.

So, putting this together, the decision tree would first check if EBIT/Total Assets is greater than 0.15. If yes, classify as solvent. If not, check if Net Income/Sales is above 0.10; if so, solvent, else insolvent.

I think that makes sense because both features are strong indicators of profitability and financial health, which directly relate to solvency.

Letâ€™s build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 using the most important features from the provided list: **Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets**, **Net Income/Total Capital**, **Sales/Total Assets**, **Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Sales**, **Net Income/Sales**, **Working Capital/Total Assets**, **Equity/Total Liabilities**, and **Equity/Total Assets**. The tree will classify whether a company is solvent or not.

### Decision Tree:
|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets <= 0.15  
||--- class: Insolvent  
|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets > 0.15  
||--- Net Income/Sales <= 0.10  
||||--- class: Solvent  

### Explanation:
1. **Root Node**: The tree starts by evaluating the ratio of **Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) to Total Assets**. This metric measures a company's operational efficiency and profitability relative to its asset base.
   - If **EBIT/Total Assets <= 0.15**, the company is classified as insolvent because it indicates poor profitability or inefficient use of assets.
2. **Second Level**: If **EBIT/Total Assets > 0.15**, the tree evaluates the **Net Income/Sales** ratio to further refine the classification.
   - If **Net Income/Sales <= 0.10**, the company is classified as solvent because it demonstrates reasonable profitability even after accounting for expenses and taxes.

This decision tree uses two of the most critical financial ratios: **EBIT/Total Assets** (a measure of operational efficiency) and **Net Income/Sales** (a measure of profitability). The thresholds were selected based on general financial benchmarks to distinguish between solvent and insolvent companies.

Alright, I need to create a Python function that predicts whether a company is solvent or insolvent based on the provided financial features. The decision tree should have a maximum depth of two and use the most important features.

First, I'll look at the list of features provided: ['EBIT/TA', 'NI/TC', 'Sales/TA', 'EBIT/Sales', 'NI/Sales', 'WC/TA', 'Equity/TL', 'Equity/TA']. The target variable is 'target' with 1 being solvent and 0 insolvent.

I need to choose the most important features for the decision tree. From my knowledge, EBIT/TA is a strong indicator of operational efficiency, so that should be the root node. If EBIT/TA is low, say <= 0.15, it's likely the company is insolvent. 

Next, for companies with EBIT/TA > 0.15, I'll use Net Income/Sales as the second feature. If NI/Sales is <= 0.10, it indicates reasonable profitability, so classify as solvent.

Now, I'll structure the function to take a dictionary X of features and return the prediction along with a list of node evaluations (1 if condition met, else 0).

I have to ensure that all feature keys match exactly, including cases and spacing. Also, replace 'nan' with appropriate values, but since the example handles missing data by treating them as False, I'll do the same.

Finally, test the function with sample data to make sure it works correctly.

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting whether a company is solvent or insolvent based on financial features. The tree has a maximum depth of 2 and uses meaningful thresholds:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None, None]  # To store the truth values of the inner nodes
    
    # First feature: EBIT/TA (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Total Assets)
    ebit_ta_threshold = 0.15
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= ebit_ta_threshold if "EBIT/TA" in X else False
    
    # Second feature: NI/Sales (Net Income / Sales)
    ni_sales_threshold = 0.10
    nodes[1] = X["NI/Sales"] <= ni_sales_threshold if "NI/Sales" in X else False
    
    prediction = 0  # Default prediction is insolvent
    
    if nodes[0]:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.15
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # NI/Sales <= 0.10
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    
    # Convert boolean values to 1 (True) or 0 (False)
    nodes = [1 if node else 0 for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Feature Selection and Thresholds**:
   - The root node uses the feature `EBIT/TA` with a threshold of `0.15`. This metric measures operational efficiency relative to total assets.
     - If `EBIT/TA <= 0.15`, it suggests poor profitability or inefficient use of assets, leading to a classification of insolvent (0).
   - At the second level, the feature `NI/Sales` is used with a threshold of `0.10`. This metric measures profitability after accounting for expenses and taxes.
     - If `NI/Sales <= 0.10`, it indicates reasonable profitability, classifying the company as solvent (1).

2. **Handling Missing Data**:
   - The function includes checks to handle potential missing data by treating undefined features as `False`.

3. **Node Evaluation**:
   - The function returns a list of boolean values (converted to 0s and 1s) indicating whether the conditions at each inner node were satisfied.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input dictionary
X = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.20,  # EBIT/TA > 0.15
    "NI/Sales": 0.08   # NI/Sales <= 0.10
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)       # Output: 1 (Solvent)
print("Node Evaluations:", nodes)      # Output: [1, 1]
```

This function provides a clear and interpretable decision-making process based on key financial metrics to classify whether a company is solvent or insolvent.
