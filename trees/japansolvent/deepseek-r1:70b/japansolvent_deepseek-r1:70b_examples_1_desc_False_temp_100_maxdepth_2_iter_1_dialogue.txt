Alright, so the user wants me to build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2. They provided an example using iris features, which helps me understand what they expect.

First, I need to identify the target variable: whether a company is solvent or not. The features given are all financial ratios. I should figure out which ones are most important for determining solvency.

Looking at the features:

1. EBIT/Total Assets
2. Net Income/Total Capital
3. Sales/Total Assets
4. EBIT/Sales
5. Net Income/Sales
6. Working Capital/Total Assets
7. Equity/Total Liabilities
8. Equity/Total Assets

I think I'll need to compute these for a dataset, but since I don't have the data, I can make educated guesses based on financial analysis.

EBIT/Total Assets measures profitability. Higher values indicate better profitability, so it's likely important.

Net Income/Total Capital shows how efficiently capital is used to generate net income. Also crucial.

Working Capital/Total Assets indicates liquidity; higher might mean more solvency.

Equity/Total Liabilities is a leverage ratio; lower means more debt, which could be risky.

I'll pick the top two features based on their relevance: EBIT/Total Assets and Net Income/Total Capital.

Now, I need to split these into thresholds. For example, if EBIT/TA is above a certain value, the company might be solvent. If not, then check Net Income/TC. This creates a tree with depth 2.

I'll assign thresholds based on typical values. Maybe 5% for EBIT/TA and 10% for Net Income/TC as they seem reasonable.

So, the decision tree will first split on EBIT/TA. If it's above 5%, solvent. Otherwise, check Net Income/TC: if above 10%, solvent; else, insolvent.

I should present this in a clear format, similar to the example given. The user can then apply these thresholds to classify companies.
</think>

Based on the features provided, here is a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 that classifies whether a company is solvent or not. The tree uses the most important financial ratios for solvency analysis:

```
Decision Tree:
|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets <= 0.05
||--- Net Income/Total Capital <= 0.10
||||--- class: insolvent
||--- Net Income/Total Capital > 0.10
||||--- class: solvent
|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets > 0.05
||--- Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.20
||||--- class: insolvent
||--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.20
||||--- class: solvent
```

### Explanation:
1. **Root Node**: The first split is based on `Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets` (EBIT/TA). This ratio measures a company's profitability relative to its assets.
   - If `EBIT/TA <= 0.05`, the company has low profitability, and we further evaluate its solvency based on `Net Income/Total Capital`.
2. **Second Layer**:
   - For companies with `EBIT/TA <= 0.05`:
     - If `Net Income/Total Capital <= 0.10`, the company is classified as insolvent.
     - If `Net Income/Total Capital > 0.10`, the company is classified as solvent.
   - For companies with `EBIT/TA > 0.05`, we further evaluate their solvency based on `Working Capital/Total Assets`.
3. **Final Layer**:
   - For companies with `EBIT/TA > 0.05`:
     - If `Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.20`, the company is classified as insolvent.
     - If `Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.20`, the company is classified as solvent.

This decision tree prioritizes profitability (`EBIT/TA`) and liquidity (`Working Capital/Total Assets`) as key factors in determining solvency, with a secondary focus on net income efficiency (`Net Income/Total Capital`).

<think>
Alright, I'm trying to tackle this problem where I need to create a Python function that predicts whether a company is solvent or insolvent based on some financial ratios. The decision tree provided earlier uses EBIT/TA and WC/TA as the main features for splitting, with thresholds of 0.05 and 0.20 respectively.

First, I'll need to understand each feature and what they represent:

1. **EBIT/TA (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets)**: This ratio measures a company's profitability relative to its total assets. A higher value indicates better profitability.

2. **NI/TC (Net Income/Total Capital)**: This shows how efficiently a company uses its capital to generate net income. It's another indicator of financial health.

3. **Sales/TA**: Indicates how well sales are being generated from the company's assets.

4. **EBIT/Sales**: Measures profitability in terms of sales. Higher is better as it indicates more earnings per sale.

5. **NI/Sales**: Shows net income efficiency relative to sales, indicating how much of each sale translates to net income.

6. **WC/TA (Working Capital/Total Assets)**: Reflects the liquidity position of a company. Higher working capital relative to assets generally means better short-term financial health.

7. **Equity/TL (Equity/Total Liabilities)**: Indicates the proportion of equity financing relative to liabilities, which is important for assessing solvency.

8. **Equity/TA (Equity/Total Assets)**: Shows how much of the company's assets are financed by equity, indicating leverage and financial stability.

The target variable is whether the company is solvent (1) or insolvent (0).

Now, looking at the decision tree structure:

- The root node splits on EBIT/TA with a threshold of 0.05.
  - If EBIT/TA <= 0.05, it further splits on NI/TC with a threshold of 0.10.
    - If NI/TC <= 0.10: Insolvent
    - Else: Solvent
  - If EBIT/TA > 0.05, it further splits on WC/TA with a threshold of 0.20.
    - If WC/TA <= 0.20: Insolvent
    - Else: Solvent

So, the tree uses two features: first EBIT/TA at depth 1 and then either NI/TC or WC/TA at depth 2.

I need to represent this logic in a Python function that takes a dictionary of features (X) as input and returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values representing the inner nodes' conditions. The list should have two elements corresponding to the two splits, where each element is 1 if the condition was met and 0 otherwise.

First, I'll define the function `predict` that accepts a dictionary X with keys as feature names.

Next, initialize a list `nodes` of size 2 (since max depth is 2) filled with None or False initially. These will hold the boolean values of each inner node condition.

Then, compute the conditions:

1. Check if EBIT/TA <= 0.05. Assign this to nodes[0].
2. Based on whether EBIT/TA was above or below threshold:
   - If true (EBIT/TA <= 0.05), check NI/TC <= 0.10 and assign to nodes[1].
   - Else, check WC/TA > 0.20. Since the condition is an else if in the tree, we need to represent it as a separate node.

Wait, but according to the decision tree, when EBIT/TA > 0.05, the next split is on WC/TA <= 0.20 for insolvent and > 0.20 for solvent. So actually:

- For nodes[1], if EBIT/TA was true (<= 0.05), then nodes[1] = NI/TC <= 0.10.
- Else, we still have another condition: WC/TA <= 0.20.

But since the function requires a list of truth values for inner nodes, and there are two splits after root, perhaps both conditions need to be captured regardless of the path taken.

Wait, no. Each prediction only goes through one path in the tree. So, depending on whether EBIT/TA is above or below 0.05, either NI/TC or WC/TA is evaluated. Therefore, in the list `nodes`, I think we need to represent both conditions but only evaluate the relevant one based on the first condition.

But according to the example provided, it's necessary to fill the nodes list with two boolean values, each corresponding to an inner node. So regardless of the path taken, both inner nodes' conditions are evaluated and their truth values stored in `nodes`.

Wait, looking back at the example given:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["HbA1c_level"] <= 6.7
    nodes[1] = X["blood_glucose_level"] <= 210

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes

In this example, both inner node conditions are evaluated and stored in `nodes` regardless of the path taken. So even though only one path is executed (either HbA1c_level <=6.7 leads to checking blood_glucose_level), both conditions are computed.

Therefore, for our problem, we need to compute both nodes[0] and nodes[1], where:

- nodes[0]: EBIT/TA <= 0.05
- nodes[1]: (if nodes[0] is true) NI/TC <= 0.10; else WC/TA <= 0.20

But wait, in the decision tree, when nodes[0] is false (EBIT/TA >0.05), the next condition is WC/TA <=0.20 for insolvent. So in terms of code:

nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.20

Therefore, regardless of which path is taken, both inner node conditions are computed as features.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Because in the example, nodes[1] is always computed, whether or not it's used in prediction.

So, perhaps for our function:

nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.20

But then, depending on nodes[0], we use either NI/TC or WC/TA.

Wait, no. Because if nodes[0] is true (EBIT/TA <=0.05), the next condition is based on NI/TC; else it's based on WC/TA.

Therefore, to accurately represent both inner nodes' conditions, we need:

nodes = [X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05]

Then, if EBIT/TA <=0.05, check NI/TC <=0.10; else, check WC/TA <=0.20.

But in the list `nodes`, there are two elements, each representing an inner node condition. So perhaps nodes[1] should represent both possibilities? That might be a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to structure the function so that:

- Compute EBIT/TA <= 0.05 (nodes[0])
- If nodes[0], compute NI/TC <= 0.10 (nodes[1])
- Else, compute WC/TA > 0.20? Or is it <=?

Wait, in the decision tree, if EBIT/TA >0.05, then:

if WC/TA <=0.20: insolvent
else: solvent

So nodes[1] should be X["WC/TA"] <=0.20.

But that's only for when EBIT/TA >0.05.

In the example provided earlier, the function calculates both inner node conditions regardless of which path is taken because it computes both HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level thresholds upfront.

Therefore, in our case:

nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.20

But wait, that leaves out the NI/TC condition. Because when EBIT/TA is low, we look at NI/TC.

So perhaps in this case, nodes should be:

- nodes[0]: EBIT/TA <= 0.05
- nodes[1]: NI/TC <= 0.10 if nodes[0] else WC/TA <= 0.20

But how to represent that? Because we need a single condition for nodes[1], but it depends on nodes[0].

Alternatively, perhaps in the function, regardless of the path, both inner node conditions are evaluated, but depending on which path is taken, only one affects the prediction.

In other words:

Compute EBIT/TA <= 0.05 (nodes[0])
Compute NI/TC <= 0.10 and WC/TA <=0.20 separately, then based on nodes[0], decide which one to use for the next split.

But in terms of the `nodes` list, it's supposed to represent the truth values of the inner nodes. So perhaps we have two separate inner nodes: one for NI/TC and another for WC/TA.

Wait, but according to the decision tree structure:

- Root node: EBIT/TA
  - Left child: NI/TC (if EBIT/TA <=0.05)
    - Further left: insolvent if NI/TC <=0.10
    - Right: solvent
  - Right child: WC/TA (if EBIT/TA >0.05)
    - Further left: insolvent if WC/TA <=0.20
    - Right: solvent

So there are two inner nodes after the root:

- NI/TC node and WC/TA node.

But in terms of function logic, we have to represent both conditions even though only one is used per prediction path.

Therefore, perhaps the `nodes` list will contain two booleans:

nodes[0] = EBIT/TA <= 0.05
nodes[1] = (if nodes[0]) then NI/TC <=0.10 else WC/TA <=0.20

But how to represent this in code? Because it's conditional.

Alternatively, compute both conditions upfront regardless of the path:

Compute EBIT/TA <=0.05 → nodes[0]
Compute NI/TC <=0.10 → nodes[1]
Compute WC/TA <=0.20 → but then we only have two positions in `nodes`.

Hmm, perhaps in this case, it's better to structure the function so that:

- nodes[0] = EBIT/TA <= 0.05
- if nodes[0], nodes[1] = NI/TC <=0.10
- else, nodes[1] = WC/TA <=0.20

But in terms of code, we can compute both upfront and then choose based on the first node.

Wait, perhaps it's acceptable to have:

nodes = [False, False]
nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
if nodes[0]:
    nodes[1] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.10
else:
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.20

Then, based on the conditions:

if nodes[0]:
    if nodes[1]:
        prediction = 0  # insolvent
    else:
        prediction = 1  # solvent
else:
    if nodes[1]:
        prediction = 0  # insolvent (WC/TA <=0.20)
    else:
        prediction = 1  # solvent

But wait, in the decision tree:

- If EBIT/TA >0.05 and WC/TA >0.20 → solvent
- Else if EBIT/TA >0.05 and WC/TA <=0.20 → insolvent

Which is correctly captured by:

if not nodes[0]:  # EBIT/TA >0.05
    if nodes[1]:  # WC/TA <=0.20
        prediction =0
    else:
        prediction=1

Similarly, when nodes[0] is true:

- If nodes[1] (NI/TC <=0.10) → insolvent
- Else → solvent

This seems correct.

Therefore, the function will look like:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [False, False]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.10
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.20

    if nodes[0]:  # EBIT/TA low
        if nodes[1]:  # NI/TC low → insolvent
            prediction = 0
        else:  # NI/TC high → solvent
            prediction = 1
    else:  # EBIT/TA high
        if nodes[1]:  # WC/TA low → insolvent
            prediction = 0
        else:  # WC/TA high → solvent
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but in the decision tree:

- If EBIT/TA >0.05 and WC/TA <=0.20 → insolvent (prediction=0)
- Else → solvent (prediction=1)

Yes.

But wait, does this cover all cases? Let me test some scenarios.

Test Case 1:
EBIT/TA = 0.04 (<=0.05) → nodes[0]=True
NI/TC = 0.09 (<=0.10) → nodes[1] = True
Prediction: insolvent (0)

Test Case 2:
EBIT/TA = 0.04
NI/TC=0.11 → nodes[1]=False
Prediction: solvent (1)

Test Case3:
EBIT/TA=0.06 (>0.05) → nodes[0]=False
WC/TA=0.19 → nodes[1]=True
Prediction: insolvent (0)

Test Case4:
EBIT/TA=0.06
WC/TA=0.21 → nodes[1]=False
Prediction: solvent (1)

That seems correct.

But in the `nodes` list, what do we have?

In Test Case 1: nodes = [True, True]
Test Case2: [True, False]
Test Case3: [False, True]
Test Case4: [False, False]

Which accurately represents both inner node conditions as computed based on EBIT/TA.

So the function seems correctly structured.

But looking back at the example provided earlier, in their code:

nodes[0] = X["HbA1c_level"] <=6.7
nodes[1] = X["blood_glucose_level"] <=210

Then, in the if conditions, they use both nodes to determine prediction, but both are computed upfront.

In our case, we compute nodes[0], then based on that, decide what to compute for nodes[1]. But is this acceptable?

I think yes, because `nodes` list must contain two boolean values: each representing an inner node condition. So nodes[0] is always EBIT/TA <=0.05. For nodes[1], it's either NI/TC<=0.10 (if nodes[0]) or WC/TA <=0.20 (else).

Thus, the function correctly captures both conditions and uses them appropriately for prediction.

Therefore, I think this structure should be correct.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to create a function that predicts whether a company is solvent or insolvent based on its EBIT/TA ratio and either NI/TC or WC/TA ratios, depending on the initial condition. The function will return both the prediction (solvent or insolvent) and a list of boolean values representing the conditions evaluated at each inner node of the decision tree.

### Approach
1. **Decision Tree Structure**: The decision tree is structured with three levels:
   - Root Node: Checks if EBIT/TA ratio is less than or equal to 0.05.
     - Left Child: If true, checks if NI/TC ratio is less than or equal to 0.10.
       - Further left child indicates insolvency (prediction = 0).
       - Right child indicates solvency (prediction = 1).
     - Right Child: If false, checks if WC/TA ratio is less than or equal to 0.20.
       - Further left child indicates insolvency (prediction = 0).
       - Right child indicates solvency (prediction = 1).

2. **Boolean Conditions**: The function evaluates two boolean conditions:
   - `nodes[0]`: EBIT/TA <= 0.05
   - `nodes[1]`: NI/TC <= 0.10 if `nodes[0]` is true, otherwise WC/TA <= 0.20.

3. **Prediction Logic**: Based on the evaluated conditions, the function determines whether the company is solvent or insolvent by traversing through the decision tree path determined by the boolean values in `nodes`.

### Solution Code
```python
def predict_financial_health(X):
    nodes = [False, False]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
    
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.10
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.20

    if nodes[0]:  # EBIT/TA is low
        prediction = 0 if nodes[1] else 1
    else:         # EBIT/TA is high
        prediction = 0 if nodes[1] else 1

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: The function initializes a list `nodes` to store the boolean values of the conditions evaluated at each inner node.
- **First Condition Check**: It evaluates whether the EBIT/TA ratio is less than or equal to 0.05 and stores this result in `nodes[0]`.
- **Second Condition Check**: Depending on the value of `nodes[0]`, it checks either the NI/TC ratio (if `nodes[0]` is true) or the WC/TA ratio (if `nodes[0]` is false) and stores the result in `nodes[1]`.
- **Prediction**: The function then uses these boolean values to determine if the company is solvent (returns 1) or insolvent (returns 0), following the decision tree logic.
- **Return Values**: Finally, the function returns both the prediction and the list of evaluated conditions (`nodes`).

This approach ensures that all necessary financial ratios are checked efficiently, and the boolean values provide transparency into which conditions were met during the evaluation.
