Alright, so I need to build a decision tree classifier that determines whether a company is solvent or not based on the given financial features. The maximum depth of the tree should be 2, which means it can have at most two decision levels.

First, let me list out all the features provided:

1. Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets (EBIT/TA)
2. Net Income/Total Capital (NI/TC)
3. Sales/Total Assets (S/TA)
4. Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Sales (EBIT/Sales)
5. Net Income/Sales (NI/Sales)
6. Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA)
7. Equity/Total Liabilities (E/T L)
8. Equity/Total Assets (E/TA)

I know that for a decision tree, I need to select the most important features and split the data based on thresholds of these features.

But wait, how do I determine which features are the most important? Maybe I should think about financial ratios and their relevance in determining solvency. Solvency generally refers to a company's ability to meet its long-term obligations. So, ratios that indicate profitability, leverage, and asset efficiency would be crucial.

Let me consider each feature:

- EBIT/TA: This measures how efficiently assets are used to generate earnings. Higher is better.
- NI/TC: Net income relative to total capital shows profitability. Higher values indicate better solvency.
- S/TA: Sales efficiency in using assets, higher means more sales per asset unit.
- EBIT/Sales: Profitability ratio; indicates how much profit is made on each sale. Higher is better.
- NI/Sales: Similar to above but with net income. Indicates overall profitability from sales.
- WC/TA: Working capital relative to total assets shows liquidity, which is important for short-term solvency.
- E/T L: Equity compared to liabilities; higher means less debt and more equity financing, indicating lower risk.
- E/TA: Equity as a percentage of total assets. Higher values mean more owner's funding relative to assets.

Now, considering all these, the most important features are likely those that directly indicate profitability (EBIT/TA, NI/TC) and leverage (E/T L, E/TA). Liquidity is also key, so WC/TA might be relevant.

But since I can only use two levels of depth, I need to pick one feature for the first split and another for the second splits. The most important features are probably those related to equity and profitability because they directly relate to solvency.

So perhaps E/T L would be a good first split because it's a direct measure of financial leverage. If a company has more equity relative to liabilities, it's generally more solvent. Then, for the second level, I can use something like EBIT/TA or NI/TC to further assess profitability.

Alternatively, maybe starting with a profitability ratio would be better since without profits, even good leverage won't ensure solvency.

I think I'll start with E/T L as the first feature because it's a key indicator of financial health. Then, for each branch (high and low E/T L), I can use another feature to split further. For high E/T L, perhaps using NI/TC makes sense to check if they're profitable enough. For low E/T L, maybe WC/TA to assess liquidity since companies with lower equity might rely more on short-term liquidity.

Wait, but the maximum depth is 2, so each node after the first split can only have two splits. Maybe I need a single second feature for both branches.

Alternatively, perhaps using EBIT/TA as the first split because it directly relates to asset efficiency and profitability. But I think E/T L is more critical because leverage is a fundamental factor in solvency.

So, my plan is:

1. First split on Equity/Total Liabilities (E/T L). Companies with higher E/T L are less leveraged and likely more solvent.
2. For the branch where E/T L is high, check another feature to confirm solvency. Maybe NI/TC since it's a profitability metric.
3. For the branch where E/T L is low, maybe use WC/TA because liquidity becomes crucial when leverage is high.

But I need to define thresholds for these splits. However, without actual data, I can only hypothesize based on typical values.

Typically, an E/T L ratio above 1 indicates that equity exceeds liabilities, which is good. A ratio below 1 means more debt than equity. So maybe the first split is at E/T L <= 1.0 and > 1.0.

Then, for companies with E/T L > 1.0 (good leverage), if their NI/TC is above a certain threshold, say 10%, they are solvent. Otherwise, maybe not solvent or further checks needed, but since depth is limited, we have to classify based on this.

For companies with E/T L <= 1.0, check WC/TA. A higher ratio indicates better liquidity; perhaps if WC/TA > 20% (again, a common threshold), they are considered solvent.

So the decision tree would look like:

- Root: Equity/Total Liabilities
   - If E/T L > 1.0:
      - Check NI/TC: if above a certain value, classify as Solvent.
      - Else, maybe Non-Solvent or further checks, but since depth is limited, assume based on this.
   - If E/T L <= 1.0:
      - Check WC/TA: if above a threshold, Solvent; else, Non-Solvent.

But without exact data, the thresholds are hypothetical. So I'll structure it accordingly in the tree.
</think>

To determine whether a company is solvent or not using a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, we can use the following approach based on the provided financial features:

### Decision Tree Structure:
1. **First Split: Equity/Total Liabilities (E/T L)**
   - **Threshold:** 1.0
     - If E/T L > 1.0: The company has more equity than liabilities, indicating lower leverage.
     - If E/T L ≤ 1.0: The company has more liabilities than equity, indicating higher leverage.

2. **Second Split for each branch from the First Split:**
   - **For E/T L > 1.0:**
     - Use Net Income/Total Capital (NI/TC) with a hypothetical threshold of 10%.
       - If NI/TC ≥ 10%, classify as Solvent.
       - If NI/TC < 10%, classify as Non-Solvent.

   - **For E/T L ≤ 1.0:**
     - Use Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) with a hypothetical threshold of 20%.
       - If WC/TA ≥ 20%, classify as Solvent.
       - If WC/TA < 20%, classify as Non-Solvent.

### Decision Tree Representation:
```
|--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 1.0
||--- Net Income/Total Capital >= 10%
||||--- class: Solvent
||--- Net Income/Total Capital < 10%
||||--- class: Non-Solvent
|--- Equity/Total Liabilities <= 1.0
||--- Working Capital/Total Assets >= 20%
||||--- class: Solvent
||--- Working Capital/Total Assets < 20%
||||--- class: Non-Solvent
```

### Explanation:
- **E/T L** is a crucial indicator of financial leverage and solvency. A ratio above 1.0 suggests better financial health.
- **NI/TC** assesses profitability relative to total capital, indicating how efficiently the company uses its capital to generate net income.
- **WC/TA** measures liquidity, which is vital for companies with higher debt levels to meet short-term obligations.

This tree provides a structured approach to classifying solvency using two levels of decision-making based on key financial ratios.

Alright, so I need to create a Python function that builds a decision tree classifier based on the provided financial features. The goal is to predict whether a company is solvent or not. The decision tree should have a maximum depth of 2 and use the most important features.

First, let me understand the features available:

- EBIT/TA: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes divided by Total Assets.
- NI/TC: Net Income over Total Capital.
- Sales/TA: Sales divided by Total Assets.
- EBIT/Sales: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes over Sales.
- NI/Sales: Net Income over Sales.
- WC/TA: Working Capital divided by Total Assets.
- Equity/TL: Equity over Total Liabilities.
- Equity/TA: Equity over Total Assets.

And the target variable is whether the company is solvent (1) or insolvent (0).

Now, I need to build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. That means there can be at most two levels of decisions. So, I'll have one root node and up to three leaf nodes in total.

I think the first split should be based on a feature that indicates the company's leverage or financial health. Equity/TL seems like a good candidate because it directly compares equity to liabilities. A higher ratio means the company has more equity relative to liabilities, which is generally healthier.

So, for the first condition, I'll use Equity/TL <= 1.0. If this condition is true, it suggests that the company's equity is less than or equal to its total liabilities, indicating higher leverage and potential financial stress. Otherwise, if Equity/TL > 1.0, the company has more equity than liabilities, which is a good sign of solvency.

Next, for each branch from the first split, I need another condition (second level). For companies with Equity/TL <= 1.0, I should look at their liquidity or ability to meet short-term obligations. WC/TA (Working Capital over Total Assets) could be a suitable feature here because working capital reflects the company's liquid assets minus its current liabilities.

So, for the second condition in this branch, if WC/TA >= 20%, it indicates good liquidity and likely solvency. If WC/TA < 20%, it suggests poor liquidity and potential insolvency.

For companies with Equity/TL > 1.0, I should consider their profitability to confirm solvency. NI/TC (Net Income over Total Capital) is a good measure here as it shows how efficiently the company uses its capital to generate net income. If NI/TC >= 10%, it indicates healthy profitability and likely solvency. If NI/TC < 10%, it suggests underperformance, which might indicate insolvency.

Putting this together, the decision tree will first split on Equity/TL <= 1.0. Then:

- If true (Equity/TL <= 1.0), check WC/TA >= 20%.
- If false (Equity/TL > 1.0), check NI/TC >= 10%.

Based on these conditions, the function will return a prediction of whether the company is solvent (1) or insolvent (0). Additionally, it needs to keep track of the truth values for each inner node condition.

I need to make sure that the keys used in the function match exactly with the provided feature names. For example, 'Equity/TL' and 'WC/TA' should be correctly referenced in the dictionary.

Now, I'll proceed to write the Python function following this structure.
</think>

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how we can implement the decision tree classifier in Python:

1. **Define Features and Target Variable:**
   - We have several financial features that describe the company's health.
   - The target variable is whether the company is solvent (1) or insolvent (0).

2. **Decision Tree Structure:**
   - **First Split:** Use `Equity/TL` with a threshold of 1.0.
     - If `Equity/TL <= 1.0`: Company has higher leverage, so check liquidity (`WC/TA >= 20%`).
     - If `Equity/TL > 1.0`: Company has lower leverage, so check profitability (`NI/TC >= 10%`).

3. **Prediction Logic:**
   - Based on the splits, classify the company as solvent or insolvent.

4. **Track Inner Node Conditions:**
   - Maintain a list `nodes` where each entry represents whether the condition at that node was met (1 for true, 0 for false).

5. **Return Prediction and Node Results:**
   - The function returns both the final prediction and the list of node evaluations.

Here is the Python function implementing this decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict) -> tuple[int, list[int]]:
    nodes = [None] * 2
    
    # First condition: Equity/Total Liabilities <= 1.0
    nodes[0] = X['Equity/TL'] <= 1.0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Second condition for Equity/TL <= 1.0 branch: Working Capital/Total Assets >= 20%
        nodes[1] = X['WC/TA'] >= 0.2
        prediction = 1 if nodes[1] else 0
    else:
        # Second condition for Equity/TL > 1.0 branch: Net Income/Total Capital >= 10%
        nodes[1] = X['NI/TC'] >= 0.1
        prediction = 1 if nodes[1] else 0
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple with the predicted class (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent) and a list of binary values indicating whether each condition was met during the decision-making process.
