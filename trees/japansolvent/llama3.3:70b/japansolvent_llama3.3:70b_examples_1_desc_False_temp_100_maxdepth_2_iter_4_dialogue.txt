Based on the provided features, I will build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 to classify whether a company is solvent or not. Here's the induced decision tree:

|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets <= 0.15
||--- class: Insolvent
|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets > 0.15
||--- Equity/Total Liabilities <= 1.20
|||--- class: Insolvent
||--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 1.20
|||--- class: Solvent

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* The first split is based on Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets (a measure of profitability), with a threshold of 0.15. If this ratio is less than or equal to 0.15, the company is likely to be insolvent.
* For companies with an Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets ratio greater than 0.15, the second split is based on Equity/Total Liabilities (a measure of financial leverage), with a threshold of 1.20. If this ratio is less than or equal to 1.20, the company is still likely to be insolvent.
* Companies with an Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets ratio greater than 0.15 and an Equity/Total Liabilities ratio greater than 1.20 are classified as solvent.

Note that this decision tree is based on a simplified analysis of the provided features and may not reflect real-world complexities. In practice, more detailed financial analysis and additional features might be necessary to build a robust classifier.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for predicting whether a company is solvent or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a company is solvent or not based on its financial features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the company's financial features.
            - EBIT/TA: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets
            - NI/TC: Net Income/Total Capital
            - Sales/TA: Sales/Total Assets
            - EBIT/Sales: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Sales
            - NI/Sales: Net Income/Sales
            - WC/TA: Working Capital/Total Assets
            - Equity/TL: Equity/Total Liabilities
            - Equity/TA: Equity/Total Assets

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the predicted class label (0 = insolvent, 1 = solvent)
            and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.15
    nodes[1] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 1.20

    if not nodes[0]:
        if not nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 0

    # Convert boolean values to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return int(prediction), nodes


# Example usage
X = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.10,
    "NI/TC": 0.05,
    "Sales/TA": 2.50,
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.04,
    "NI/Sales": 0.02,
    "WC/TA": 0.20,
    "Equity/TL": 1.00,
    "Equity/TA": 0.60
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (0 = insolvent, 1 = solvent)")
print(f"Inner nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this code:

*   We define a function `predict` that takes a dictionary `X` containing the company's financial features.
*   The decision tree has two inner nodes based on the conditions `EBIT/TA <= 0.15` and `Equity/TL <= 1.20`.
*   The prediction is made by evaluating these conditions and returning either 0 (insolvent) or 1 (solvent).
*   We also return a list of truth values for the inner nodes, where `True` becomes 1 and `False` becomes 0.

Note that you should replace the example feature values in the dictionary `X` with actual data to make predictions.
