To build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 for determining whether a company is solvent or not based on the provided financial features, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Feature Selection**: Identify the most important features that contribute to the classification.
2. **Decision Tree Construction**: Use the selected features to construct a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2.

Given features:
- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets (EBIT/TA)
- Net Income/Total Capital (NI/TC)
- Sales/Total Assets (S/TA)
- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Sales (EBIT/S)
- Net Income/Sales (NI/S)
- Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA)
- Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TLL)
- Equity/Total Assets (E/TA)

For simplicity, let's assume we've performed feature selection and found that `EBIT/TA` and `E/TLL` are the two most important features for determining solvency. The decision to choose these features is based on their common use in financial analysis for assessing a company's profitability and leverage.

**Decision Tree:**

|--- EBIT/TA <= 0.10
||--- class: Insolvent
|--- EBIT/TA > 0.10
||--- E/TLL <= 1.00
|||--- class: Insolvent
||--- E/TLL > 1.00
|||--- class: Solvent

**Explanation**:
- The first split is based on `EBIT/TA` with a threshold of 0.10, indicating that companies with earnings before interest and taxes less than or equal to 10% of their total assets are initially classified as insolvent. This suggests that the ability to generate earnings from assets is a critical factor in solvency.
- For companies with `EBIT/TA` greater than 0.10, the decision tree further splits based on `E/TLL`. Companies with an equity to total liabilities ratio less than or equal to 1.00 are classified as insolvent, indicating high leverage and potential financial distress. Those with a ratio greater than 1.00 are classified as solvent, suggesting healthier financials due to lower debt levels relative to equity.

This decision tree provides a basic framework for classifying companies as solvent or insolvent based on their financial performance and leverage. However, real-world applications would require more sophisticated models, possibly incorporating additional features and considering the complexities of financial markets and regulatory environments.

Based on the provided features and target variable, I will create a decision tree function in Python. The decision tree will use `EBIT/TA` and `Equity/TL` as the most important features for determining solvency.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a company is solvent or not based on its financial features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the financial features of the company.
              The keys should be 'EBIT/TA', 'NI/TC', 'Sales/TA', 'EBIT/Sales',
              'NI/Sales', 'WC/TA', 'Equity/TL', 'Equity/TA'.
    
    Returns:
    prediction (int): A binary value indicating whether the company is solvent (1) or insolvent (0).
    nodes (list): A list of boolean values representing the conditions at each inner node.
                  1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Node 0: EBIT/TA <= 0.05
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05
    # Node 1: Equity/TL <= 1.5 (for companies with EBIT/TA > 0.05)
    nodes[1] = X['Equity/TL'] <= 1.5
    
    if not nodes[0]:  # EBIT/TA > 0.05
        if nodes[1]:  # Equity/TL <= 1.5
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:  # Equity/TL > 1.5
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.05
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    
    # Convert boolean values to integers (1 if True, 0 if False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

In this function, we first check the `EBIT/TA` ratio. If it's less than or equal to 0.05, we immediately classify the company as insolvent. Otherwise, we further examine the `Equity/TL` ratio. If it's less than or equal to 1.5, we classify the company as insolvent; otherwise, we classify it as solvent.

The `nodes` list stores the boolean values representing the conditions at each inner node, which are then converted to integers (1 if True, 0 if False) before being returned along with the prediction.
