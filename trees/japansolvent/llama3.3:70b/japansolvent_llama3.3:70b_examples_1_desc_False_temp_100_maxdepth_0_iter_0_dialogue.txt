To induce a decision tree classifier for determining whether a company is solvent or not based on the provided financial features, we'll follow a similar structure to your example. However, without specific data or thresholds, I'll outline a hypothetical decision tree based on general principles of financial health indicators.

1. **Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets (EBIT/TA)**: This ratio indicates a company's profitability from operations before financing costs and taxes, relative to its total assets. A higher ratio suggests better operational efficiency and ability to generate earnings from assets.

2. **Net Income/Total Capital**: This measures the return on total capital employed by the company, indicating how well it generates profits from both debt and equity.

3. **Sales/Total Assets (Asset Turnover)**: Shows how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.

4. **Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Sales (EBIT Margin)**: Indicates profitability as a percentage of sales, before interest and taxes.

5. **Net Income/Sales**: Net profit margin, showing the net income generated as a percentage of sales.

6. **Working Capital/Total Assets**: Working capital ratio indicates liquidity and the company's ability to meet short-term obligations using its current assets.

7. **Equity/Total Liabilities**: Debt-to-equity ratio, indicating financial leverage and risk associated with debt financing.

8. **Equity/Total Assets**: Shows the proportion of total assets financed by equity, indicating a lower risk profile if higher.

Given these features, a hypothetical decision tree could look like this:

- **Root Node**: Equity/Total Liabilities <= 1.0
    - If true, proceed to check EBIT/TA.
    - If false (Equity/Total Liabilities > 1.0), company might be considered less solvent due to high debt levels.

    - **Node 1**: EBIT/TA >= 0.10
        - Indicates positive operational profitability and potentially good solvency.
        - Proceed to check Sales/Total Assets.
        
        - **Node 1.1**: Sales/Total Assets >= 0.80
            - Suggests efficient asset utilization for sales generation.
            - Classify as Solvent.

    - **Node 2**: EBIT/TA < 0.10
        - Indicates lower operational profitability, potentially concerning solvency.
        - Proceed to check Working Capital/Total Assets.

        - **Node 2.1**: Working Capital/Total Assets >= 0.20
            - Suggests manageable short-term liquidity and potential for solvency.
            - Further check Net Income/Sales.

            - **Node 2.1.1**: Net Income/Sales >= 0.05
                - Indicates positive net profitability, which is a good sign of solvency.
                - Classify as Solvent.

            - **Node 2.1.2**: Net Income/Sales < 0.05
                - Negative or low net profitability might indicate insolvency risks.
                - Classify as Insolvent.

        - **Node 2.2**: Working Capital/Total Assets < 0.20
            - Indicates potential liquidity issues, suggesting higher risk of insolvency.
            - Classify as Insolvent.

This hypothetical tree uses a combination of profitability, efficiency, and leverage ratios to classify solvency. The thresholds (e.g., 1.0 for Equity/Total Liabilities, 0.10 for EBIT/TA) are arbitrary in this example and would need adjustment based on real data analysis or industry benchmarks. In practice, constructing an accurate decision tree requires training data with known outcomes (solvent or insolvent companies) to determine the most predictive features and their optimal thresholds.

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree classifier based on the provided financial features. The thresholds used in this example are arbitrary and may need to be adjusted based on real data analysis or industry benchmarks.

```python
def predict_solvent(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a company is solvent or not based on its financial features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the financial features of the company.
              The keys should match the feature names provided in the problem statement.
              
    Returns:
    prediction (int): 1 if the company is predicted to be solvent, 0 otherwise.
    nodes (list): A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """
    
    # Initialize the list to store node values
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Equity/Total Liabilities <= 1.0
    nodes[0] = X['Equity/TL'] <= 1.0
    
    # If Node 1 is True, proceed to check EBIT/TA
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 2: EBIT/TA >= 0.10
        nodes[1] = X['EBIT/TA'] >= 0.10
        
        # If Node 2 is True, proceed to check Sales/Total Assets
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 3: Sales/Total Assets >= 0.80

            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                # If Node 3 is False, further check Net Income/Sales
                nodes[3] = X['NI/Sales'] >= 0.05
                
                # If Node 4 is True, the company is likely solvent
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
        else:
            # If Node 2 is False, proceed to check Working Capital/Total Assets
            nodes[3] = X['WC/TA'] >= 0.20
            
            # If Node 4 is True, the company might still be solvent
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:
        # If Node 1 is False, the company is likely insolvent due to high debt levels
        prediction = 0
        
    # Convert boolean node values to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) if node is not None else None for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X = {
    'EBIT/TA': 0.15,
    'NI/TC': 0.20,
    'Sales/TA': 0.90,
    'EBIT/Sales': 0.10,
    'NI/Sales': 0.06,
    'WC/TA': 0.25,
    'Equity/TL': 1.2,
    'Equity/TA': 0.60
}

prediction, nodes = predict_solvent(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the financial features of a company as input and returns a prediction (1 for solvent or 0 for insolvent) along with a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree. The thresholds used in this example are arbitrary and may need to be adjusted based on real data analysis or industry benchmarks.
