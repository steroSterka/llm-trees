Based on the provided features, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict whether a company is solvent or not. Here's the decision tree:

|--- Equity/Total Liabilities <= 1.50
||--- class: Insolvent
|--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 1.50
||--- Net Income/Total Capital <= 0.10
|||--- class: Insolvent
||--- Net Income/Total Capital > 0.10
|||--- Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.20
||||--- class: Insolvent
|||--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.20
||||--- class: Solvent

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

1. The first split is based on the Equity/Total Liabilities ratio, which is a common indicator of a company's solvency. A ratio below 1.50 may indicate that the company has too much debt compared to its equity, making it more likely to be insolvent.
2. For companies with an Equity/Total Liabilities ratio above 1.50, the next split is based on the Net Income/Total Capital ratio, which measures a company's profitability. A ratio below 0.10 may indicate that the company is not generating enough income to cover its capital expenses, making it more likely to be insolvent.
3. For companies with a Net Income/Total Capital ratio above 0.10, the next split is based on the Working Capital/Total Assets ratio, which measures a company's liquidity. A ratio below 0.20 may indicate that the company has insufficient working capital to meet its short-term obligations, making it more likely to be insolvent.

Note that this decision tree is not exhaustive and may not capture all the complexities of a company's financial situation. Additionally, the thresholds used in the splits are arbitrary and may need to be adjusted based on the specific data and problem domain.

Here's the decision tree as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether a company is solvent or not based on its financial features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the financial features of the company.
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (1 = solvent, 0 = insolvent) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """
    
    # Initialize the list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = [None] * 4
    
    # Check if Equity/Total Liabilities is less than or equal to 1.50
    nodes[0] = X['Equity/TL'] <= 1.50
    
    # If Equity/Total Liabilities is greater than 1.50, check if Net Income/Total Capital is less than or equal to 0.10
    nodes[1] = X['NI/TC'] <= 0.10 if not nodes[0] else None
    
    # If Net Income/Total Capital is greater than 0.10, check if Working Capital/Total Assets is less than or equal to 0.20
    nodes[2] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.20 if (not nodes[0]) and (nodes[1] is None or not nodes[1]) else None
    
    # If all conditions are met, check the final condition
    nodes[3] = True if (not nodes[0]) and (nodes[1] is None or not nodes[1]) and (nodes[2] is None or not nodes[2]) else False
    
    # Make a prediction based on the inner nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    elif nodes[1]:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    elif nodes[2]:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Solvent
    
    # Replace None values with 0 (False) to represent the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = [int(node) if node is not None else 0 for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
X = {
    'EBIT/TA': 0.10,
    'NI/TC': 0.05,
    'Sales/TA': 1.20,
    'EBIT/Sales': 0.08,
    'NI/Sales': 0.04,
    'WC/TA': 0.15,
    'Equity/TL': 1.20,
    'Equity/TA': 0.60
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f'Prediction: {prediction}')
print(f'Inner nodes: {nodes}')
```

In this code:

*   We define a function `predict` that takes a dictionary `X` containing the financial features of a company.
*   Inside the function, we initialize a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.
*   We then evaluate each condition in the decision tree and update the corresponding node in the `nodes` list.
*   Based on the conditions met, we make a prediction (1 = solvent or 0 = insolvent) for the company.
*   Finally, we replace any `None` values in the `nodes` list with 0 to represent False and return the prediction along with the `nodes` list.
