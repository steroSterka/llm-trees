To induce a decision tree classifier for determining whether a company is solvent or not based on the given financial features, we'll use a similar structure to your example but apply it to the new set of features. The most important features for assessing a company's solvency typically include its profitability, efficiency in using assets, ability to cover liabilities, and cash flow management.

Given features:
1. Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets (EBIT/TA) - Measures profitability in relation to total assets.
2. Net Income/Total Capital (NI/TC) - Indicates how well a company generates earnings from its capital.
3. Sales/Total Assets (S/TA) - Reflects asset efficiency.
4. Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Sales (EBIT/S) - Shows profitability per sale.
5. Net Income/Sales (NI/S) - Demonstrates net profit margin.
6. Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) - Indicates liquidity in relation to total assets.
7. Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL) - Measures the company's financial leverage and ability to pay debts.
8. Equity/Total Assets (E/TA) - Reflects the proportion of assets financed by equity.

To simplify, let's consider that a higher value for most of these ratios generally indicates better financial health, except where high values might indicate over-leveraging or inefficiency.

Decision Tree with a maximum depth of 2:
- **Root Node**: Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL) is chosen as the first feature because it directly reflects a company's ability to cover its liabilities with equity.
  - If E/TL > 1.0, it generally means the company has more equity than liabilities, indicating good financial health and potential solvency.
    - **Left Child Node**: Given E/TL > 1.0, we further check Net Income/Total Capital (NI/TC) to assess profitability from capital. If NI/TC > 0.10 (indicating at least a 10% return on total capital), the company is likely solvent.
      - **Class: Solvent**
    - **Right Child Node**: For E/TL > 1.0 but NI/TC <= 0.10, we may question the efficiency of capital use, suggesting further investigation is needed for solvency classification.
      - **Class: Possibly Insolvent (Further Review Needed)**
  - If E/TL <= 1.0, the company might be over-leveraged or have poorer financial health.
    - **Right Child Node**: We examine Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA). A WC/TA > 0.20 could indicate sufficient liquidity to manage short-term obligations despite higher leverage.
      - **Class: Possibly Solvent (Monitor Closely)**
    - **Left Child Node**: For E/TL <= 1.0 and WC/TA <= 0.20, the company may face significant financial distress, suggesting insolvency.
      - **Class: Insolvent**

Decision Tree:
|--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 1.0
||--- Net Income/Total Capital > 0.10
|||--- Class: Solvent
||--- Net Income/Total Capital <= 0.10
|||--- Class: Possibly Insolvent (Further Review Needed)
|--- Equity/Total Liabilities <= 1.0
||--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.20
|||--- Class: Possibly Solvent (Monitor Closely)
||--- Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.20
|||--- Class: Insolvent

This decision tree provides a basic framework for assessing solvency based on key financial ratios, emphasizing the importance of leverage, profitability, and liquidity in determining a company's financial health. However, actual implementation should consider more precise thresholds derived from historical data analysis and may require additional features or deeper trees to capture complex scenarios accurately.

Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting whether a company is solvent or not based on the given financial features.

```python
def predict_solvent(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a company is solvent or not based on its financial features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing the financial features of the company.
        - EBIT/TA: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets
        - NI/TC: Net Income/Total Capital
        - Sales/TA: Sales/Total Assets
        - EBIT/Sales: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Sales
        - NI/Sales: Net Income/Sales
        - WC/TA: Working Capital/Total Assets
        - Equity/TL: Equity/Total Liabilities
        - Equity/TA: Equity/Total Assets
    
    Returns:
    prediction (int): 1 if the company is predicted to be solvent, 0 otherwise.
    nodes (list): List of truth values for the inner nodes in the decision tree.
    """

    # Initialize list to store truth values of inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: Check if Equity/TL > 1.5 (indicating good financial health)
    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TL"] > 1.5
    
    # If the company passes the first check, further evaluate its profitability
    if nodes[0]:
        # Second node: Check if NI/TC > 0.15 (indicating reasonable return on capital)
        nodes[1] = X["NI/TC"] > 0.15
        
        # Prediction based on the decision tree
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Possibly Insolvent (Further Review Needed)
    else:
        # If the company does not pass the first check, evaluate its liquidity
        # Second node: Check if WC/TA > 0.25 (indicating sufficient working capital)
        nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] > 0.25
        
        # Prediction based on the decision tree
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Possibly Solvent (Monitor Closely)
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    
    # Convert boolean values in nodes to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
example_company = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.2,
    "NI/TC": 0.18,
    "Sales/TA": 1.5,
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.12,
    "NI/Sales": 0.08,
    "WC/TA": 0.3,
    "Equity/TL": 2.0,
    "Equity/TA": 0.6
}

prediction, nodes = predict_solvent(example_company)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (1 = Solvent, 0 = Insolvent)")
print(f"Inner Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the financial features of a company as input and returns a prediction (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent) along with a list of truth values for the inner nodes in the decision tree. The example usage demonstrates how to use this function with an example company's financial data.
