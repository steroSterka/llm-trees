Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to create a decision tree classifier for company solvency using the given financial features. First, I need to recall how decision trees work. They split the data based on feature thresholds to maximize class purity, usually using metrics like Gini impurity or information gain. 

The features provided are all ratios: EBIT/TA, NI/TC, Sales/TA, EBIT/Sales, NI/Sales, WC/TA, Equity/TL, Equity/TA. These are common financial ratios used in solvency analysis. Solvency is about a company's ability to meet long-term obligations, so ratios like equity/total liabilities and working capital/total assets are probably important.

Looking at the example they gave with the iris dataset, the decision tree splits on petal width first. The key there was that petal width was the most important feature. So I need to figure out which of these financial ratios are the most important for solvency.

I should think about which ratios are commonly used in solvency analysis. Debt to equity ratio (which is inverse of Equity/TL here) is a big one. Also, return on assets (NI/TA?), but maybe that's more profitability. Working capital ratio (WC/TA) is important because it shows liquidity. Equity/Total Assets shows the proportion of assets financed by equity, which is crucial for solvency. 

The example tree uses thresholds to split. So I need to hypothesize some thresholds. Let's start with the most important feature. Maybe Equity/Total Liabilities? Wait, Equity/Total Liabilities is actually Total Liabilities/Equity inverted. A higher Equity/TL would mean more equity relative to debt, which is better. So maybe a threshold like Equity/TL > 0.5? 

Alternatively, maybe Equity/Total Assets (Equity/TA) is more straightforward. A higher ratio here means more assets are owned by equity, which is good for solvency. Let's say a threshold here. Suppose if Equity/TA is above 0.4, the company might be solvent. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, working capital to total assets (WC/TA). A positive working capital is good, so maybe WC/TA > 0 might be a starting point, but that's probably too basic. 

Wait, the example splits on petal width first, which is a continuous feature. So I need to pick the most important feature first. Let's think about which ratio is most indicative. 

Another angle: In financial analysis, the debt to equity ratio (Total Debt/Equity) is a key solvency ratio. Since the features include Equity/Total Liabilities, which is 1/(Total Liabilities/Equity), so higher values here mean lower debt relative to equity, which is better. Maybe that's the first split. 

Alternatively, the Debt to Assets ratio (Total Debt/TA) would be 1 - Equity/TA. So Equity/TA being high is good. 

Perhaps the first split is on Equity/Total Assets. Let's assume a threshold here. Suppose if Equity/TA is above 0.3 (30%), the company is solvent, but maybe not? Maybe lower thresholds. 

Alternatively, let's think of the example's structure. The first split in the iris example was on petal width, then another split on the same feature. Maybe in the financial case, the first split is on a key ratio, then a second split on another ratio. 

Alternatively, maybe the Working Capital/Total Assets. A positive working capital is essential for short-term obligations, but solvency is long-term. Hmm. 

Alternatively, EBIT/Sales (Operating margin) could indicate profitability, which affects solvency. If EBIT/Sales is high, the company is more profitable, which helps in paying debts. 

This is a bit tricky without data, but I have to make an educated guess. Let's try to build a plausible tree step by step.

First, the most important feature might be Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL). Because if equity is much higher than total liabilities, the company is solvent. So, first split: E/TL <= 0.5. If less than 0.5, meaning liabilities are more than equity, the company might be insolvent. If greater than 0.5, maybe check another ratio. 

Alternatively, maybe Equity/Total Assets (E/TA). Suppose split on E/TA. Let's say E/TA <= 0.3: insolvent. Then, if above, check another ratio like Working Capital/TA. 

Alternatively, let's see the example again. The iris tree had two splits on the same feature (petal width), so maybe the key feature here is also split multiple times. 

Alternatively, maybe the Net Income/Sales (profit margin) is important. If a company isn't making a profit, it might be insolvent. So first split on NI/Sales. Suppose NI/Sales > 0 (profitable) vs <=0 (not). But even profitable companies can be insolvent if liabilities are too high. 

Hmm. Let me try to structure this. Let me list the features again:

1. EBIT/TA (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Total Assets)
2. NI/TC (Net Income / Total Capital)
3. Sales/TA (Sales / Total Assets)
4. EBIT/Sales (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Sales)
5. NI/Sales (Net Income / Sales)
6. WC/TA (Working Capital / Total Assets)
7. Equity/TL (Equity / Total Liabilities)
8. Equity/TA (Equity / Total Assets)

Common solvency ratios include:

- Debt to Equity Ratio (Total Debt/Equity). Here, Equity/TL is 1/(Total Liabilities/Equity), so higher is better. 
- Equity Ratio (Equity/TA), higher is better.
- Debt to Assets Ratio (Total Debt/TA) = 1 - Equity/TA. So lower is better.
- Times Interest Earned (EBIT/Interest Expense), but we don't have interest here.
- Working Capital ratio (Current Assets - Current Liabilities)/Current Liabilities, but here it's WC/TA, which is different.

Given the features, the key solvency indicators would be Equity/TA and Equity/TL. Let's start with Equity/TA. Suppose:

First split: Equity/TA <= 0.3 → insolvency. 

If Equity/TA >0.3, then check another ratio, say Equity/TL. Suppose Equity/TL <= 1.0 (meaning Equity is less than Total Liabilities, so Debt > Equity) → insolvent. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on EBIT/TA. A higher EBIT/TA means better earnings relative to assets. Suppose EBIT/TA <= 0.05 → insolvent. 

Alternatively, combining with other features. 

Alternatively, let's think step by step:

Root node: pick the feature that gives best split. Suppose Equity/TA is the most important. 

Suppose split on Equity/TA <= 0.2 → insolvent. 

If Equity/TA >0.2, split on Equity/TL. 

Suppose next split: Equity/TL <= 0.5 → insolvent, else solvent. 

But that might be too simplistic. 

Alternatively, first split on Working Capital/TA. If WC/TA is negative (WC negative), then insolvency. 

Then for WC/TA positive, check Equity/TA. 

Alternatively, the example's structure had two levels on the same feature. Maybe here, first split on Equity/TA, then on the same feature again? 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Equity/TL. 

Suppose the first split is Equity/TL <= 0.5 → insolvency. 

If Equity/TL >0.5, then split on another ratio like NI/Sales. 

Suppose NI/Sales <=0 → insolvency. 

Else, solvent. 

Alternatively, after Equity/TL >0.5, split on EBIT/Sales. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, let's think of the tree structure the user provided for iris. The first split was on petal width, then the right branch split again on petal width. 

Perhaps here, the first split is on Equity/TA. Suppose:

|--- Equity/TA <= 0.20 → class: insolvent

|--- Equity/TA > 0.20

||--- Equity/TA <= 0.50 → then check another feature?

Alternatively, maybe after first split on Equity/TA >0.2, then split on Equity/TL. 

Wait, but maybe the next split is on a different feature. Let's try to construct it step by step, making sure it's plausible. 

Alternatively, let's consider that the most important features are Equity/TA and Working Capital/TA. 

First split on Equity/TA. Suppose if Equity/TA is below 0.3, insolvency. 

If above, split on Working Capital/TA. 

If WC/TA <=0 → insolvency. 

Else, solvent. 

But maybe that's too simple. Alternatively, the next split could be on another ratio like EBIT/TA. 

Alternatively, let's think of a possible tree structure:

First split: Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL) <= 0.5 → insolvent (since liabilities are more than equity)

Else, split on another feature like EBIT/TA. 

Suppose EBIT/TA <=0.05 → insolvent (low earnings relative to assets)

Else solvent. 

But this is just a guess. 

Alternatively, considering the example's structure:

Maybe the first split is on a key ratio, then a second split on another. Let's try:

Root: Equity/TA (since it's a key solvency measure)

Split at 0.3:

If <=0.3 → insolvent.

Else, split on EBIT/TA:

Suppose EBIT/TA <=0.05 → insolvent.

Else, split on Working Capital/TA? Or maybe NI/Sales?

Alternatively, after Equity/TA >0.3, split on Equity/TL. 

Suppose Equity/TL <=1.0 → insolvent (since equity is less than liabilities)

Else solvent. 

This way:

|--- Equity/TA <= 0.3 → class: insolvent

|--- Equity/TA >0.3

||--- Equity/TL <= 1.0 → class: insolvent

||--- Equity/TL >1.0 → class: solvent

This might be possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Working Capital/TA. If WC/TA <=0 → insolvency.

Then, for WC/TA >0, split on Equity/TA. 

But the example uses the same feature twice, so maybe using Equity/TA first, then again. 

Alternatively:

|--- Equity/TA <= 0.2 → insolvent

|--- Equity/TA >0.2 and <=0.5 → class: insolvent

|--- Equity/TA >0.5 → solvent

But that might be oversimplified. 

Alternatively, maybe the most important feature is EBIT/Sales (operating margin). 

First split on EBIT/Sales <=0 → insolvent (negative operating income)

Else, split on Equity/TA. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, the user might expect a structure similar to the example, using two splits on the same feature. So maybe the key feature is Equity/TA. 

Suppose:

|--- Equity/TA <= 0.2 → insolvent

|--- Equity/TA >0.2 and <=0.4 → then split on another feature, say Equity/TL.

Wait, but to mirror the example's structure, maybe:

First split on Equity/TA: if <=0.2 → insolvent.

Else, split again on Equity/TA but higher threshold. 

Wait, that might not make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Working Capital/TA. 

|--- WC/TA <=0 → insolvent

|--- WC/TA >0

||--- Equity/TA <=0.3 → insolvent

||--- Equity/TA >0.3 → solvent

This could work. WC/TA being positive is necessary for liquidity, but not sufficient. Then Equity/TA adds solvency. 

Alternatively, combining multiple factors. 

I think I need to settle on a plausible structure. Let's go with Equity/TA as the first feature. 

First split: Equity/TA <= 0.2 → insolvent.

If Equity/TA >0.2, then split on Equity/TL (Equity over Total Liabilities). 

Suppose Equity/TL <= 0.5 → insolvent (so Total Liabilities are more than twice equity)

Else solvent. 

Thus, the tree would be:

|--- Equity/TA (cm) <= 0.20

||--- class: insolvent

|--- Equity/TA > 0.20

||--- Equity/Total Liabilities (cm) <= 0.50

|||--- class: insolvent

||--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 0.50

|||--- class: solvent

Wait but the features are in different units, but the user just listed the features as names. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Equity/TA, then on EBIT/TA. 

Alternatively, perhaps the key features are Equity/TA and Equity/TL. 

Alternatively, let me think of another approach. Since the example uses a single feature twice, maybe here, the first split is on Equity/TA, then another split on the same feature but higher threshold. For instance:

|--- Equity/TA <= 0.3 → insolvent

|--- Equity/TA >0.3 and <=0.6 → class: insolvent (maybe moderate solvency?)

Wait, but that might not be right. 

Alternatively, if Equity/TA is above a certain threshold, then solvent, else check another ratio. 

Alternatively, perhaps the most important feature is Working Capital/TA. 

First split: WC/TA <=0 → insolvent.

Then, for WC/TA >0, split on Equity/TA. 

Suppose Equity/TA <=0.3 → insolvent.

Else solvent. 

Then the tree would be:

|--- WC/TA (cm) <= 0.0

||--- class: insolvent

|--- WC/TA > 0.0

||--- Equity/TA (cm) <= 0.3

|||--- class: insolvent

||--- Equity/TA > 0.3

|||--- class: solvent

This structure makes sense because having positive working capital is necessary, then sufficient equity. 

Alternatively, another split after Equity/TA, but the example only went two layers. 

Alternatively, maybe after Equity/TA, split on another feature like EBIT/Sales. 

But to keep it simple like the example, maybe two splits. 

Alternatively, the first split is on Equity/Total Assets, then on Equity/Total Liabilities. 

Putting it all together, I think the most logical path is to first check Working Capital/TA because without positive working capital, the company can't meet short-term obligations, which is a sign of insolvency. Then, even if working capital is positive, if the equity ratio is too low, it might still be insolvent long-term. 

So the tree might look like:

|--- Working Capital/Total Assets (cm) <= 0.0 → insolvent

|--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.0

||--- Equity/Total Assets (cm) <= 0.3 → insolvent

||--- Equity/Total Assets > 0.3 → solvent

This way, two splits, first on working capital, then on equity ratio. 

Alternatively, maybe Equity/TA first. Let's see. 

Alternatively, the example's first split was on petal width (a key feature), so maybe Equity/TA is the first split. 

Suppose:

|--- Equity/TA (cm) <= 0.2 → insolvent

|--- Equity/TA > 0.2

||--- Equity/Total Liabilities (cm) <= 0.5 → insolvent

||--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 0.5 → solvent

This could work. 

Alternatively, combining both WC/TA and Equity/TA. 

Hmm. I think the first approach with WC/TA then Equity/TA is better, as WC is a liquidity measure, and Equity/TA is solvency. 

Alternatively, maybe the user expects using the most important feature first, which could be Equity/TA. 

Alternatively, looking at the features, Equity/Total Liabilities is perhaps more directly related to solvency. 

Equity/Total Liabilities is the same as 1/(Total Liabilities/Equity), so a higher ratio indicates better solvency. 

So first split on Equity/TL:

Suppose:

|--- Equity/TL (cm) <= 0.5 → insolvent (since liabilities > equity)

|--- Equity/TL >0.5

||--- EBIT/TA (cm) <= 0.05 → insolvent (low earnings)

||--- EBIT/TA >0.05 → solvent

This way, first checking debt to equity, then profitability. 

Alternatively, after Equity/TL, check another solvency ratio like Equity/TA. 

Alternatively, since I have to make a decision, I'll go with Equity/Total Liabilities as the first split, then Equity/TA for the next. 

Wait, but let's structure it step by step. Let me try to write down the tree with the features given. 

Final decision tree structure I'll propose:

The root splits on Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL) at 0.5. If E/TL <=0.5 (meaning liabilities are more than equity), then insolvent. If E/TL >0.5, then split on Equity/TA. Suppose Equity/TA <=0.3 → insolvent, else solvent. 

Alternatively, after E/TL >0.5, maybe split on Working Capital/TA. 

Alternatively, the tree:

|--- Equity/Total Liabilities (cm) <= 0.5 → insolvent

|--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 0.5

||--- Working Capital/Total Assets (cm) <=0.0 → insolvent

||--- Working Capital/Total Assets >0.0 → solvent

This way, even if equity is sufficient, if WC is negative, insolvent. 

This could make sense. 

Alternatively, combining multiple layers. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user expects the first split to be on Equity/TA and the second on Equity/TL. 

After considering different options, I think the structure with Equity/TL first then WC/TA is better, but I'll go with the first approach I thought of using WC/TA and Equity/TA. 

Thus, the tree would be:

|--- Working Capital/Total Assets (cm) <= 0.0 → insolvent

|--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.0

||--- Equity/Total Assets (cm) <= 0.3 → insolvent

||--- Equity/Total Assets > 0.3 → solvent

This way, it first ensures liquidity (WC positive), then sufficient equity for solvency. 

Alternatively, maybe the threshold for Equity/TA is higher, like 0.4 or 0.5. 

Alternatively, maybe the user expects the same structure as the example, using a single feature twice. 

In the example, the first split was on petal width, then another split on the same feature. 

So, perhaps the first split is on Equity/TA, then again on Equity/TA with a higher threshold. 

Like:

|--- Equity/TA <= 0.2 → insolvent

|--- Equity/TA >0.2 and <=0.4 → insolvent

|--- Equity/TA >0.4 → solvent

But that may not be necessary. 

Alternatively, the first split on Equity/TA at 0.3, then on a different feature. 

Alternatively, maybe the key feature is EBIT/TA, but I think Equity is more directly related. 

After some deliberation, I think the most plausible tree is:

First split on Working Capital/Total Assets. If negative, insolvent. If positive, then split on Equity/Total Assets. If Equity/TA is below 0.3, insolvent; else solvent. 

So the final answer would be structured as above.
</think>

The decision tree for determining solvency based on the provided features is structured as follows:

1. **First Split (Working Capital/Total Assets):**
   - If **Working Capital/Total Assets ≤ 0.0**, classify as **insolvent**.
   - If **Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.0**, proceed to the next split.

2. **Second Split (Equity/Total Assets):**
   - If **Equity/Total Assets ≤ 0.3**, classify as **insolvent**.
   - If **Equity/Total Assets > 0.3**, classify as **solvent**.

### Decision Tree Representation:
```
|--- Working Capital/Total Assets (cm) <= 0.0
||--- class: insolvent
|--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.0
||--- Equity/Total Assets (cm) <= 0.3
|||--- class: insolvent
||--- Equity/Total Assets > 0.3
|||--- class: solvent
```

### Explanation:
- **Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA):** A negative value indicates poor short-term liquidity, leading to insolvency.
- **Equity/Total Assets (Equity/TA):** A threshold of 0.3 ensures sufficient long-term equity to cover assets, indicating solvency when combined with positive working capital. 

This structure mirrors the example's nested splits while prioritizing liquidity followed by equity-based solvency.

<think>
Okay, I need to create a Python function based on the given decision tree structure, but the user hasn't provided the actual tree yet. Wait, the user's message starts with "Now, format this decision tree as a Python function..." but the initial part of their message seems to be a template or example. Let me check again.

Looking back, the user provided an example function for a diabetes prediction scenario, and they want me to do the same but for their company solvency problem. The features they listed are things like EBIT/TA, NI/TC, etc., and the target is 1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent.

Hmm, the problem is that the user hasn't actually given the decision tree structure. They mentioned "the decision tree" but maybe that's part of the input they expect me to infer? Wait, the initial part of their message might have been cut off. Wait, maybe the user's original question was to create a function based on a decision tree they had in mind but didn't include here. Oh, but in the problem description, there's no actual decision tree provided. This is confusing.

Wait, looking at the user's message again. The first sentence says, "Now, format this decision tree as a Python function..." implying that there was a decision tree provided before. But in the given content, after that, they only provided the feature keys, target info, and an example. The actual decision tree structure is missing. 

Oh, perhaps there was a mistake in the user's message, and the decision tree details were not included. Since the user is asking me to create the function, but without the tree structure, this is impossible. Wait, but maybe the user intended to provide the structure but it's missing? Let me read again.

Looking at the user's message structure:

- They start by asking to format the decision tree as a Python function with the nodes' truth values.
- They provide the feature keys, target, and an example function.
- The example shows that the function's nodes are based on certain conditions (e.g., petal_length <=2.5, etc.)

Wait a second. Maybe the user forgot to include the actual decision tree structure in their query. Since the assistant can't proceed without the tree's structure, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to come up with a plausible decision tree based on the features given? That's possible. Since the problem says "try to fill them with meaningful values", maybe I need to create a reasonable decision tree structure using the provided features and thresholds that make sense.

Alright, I'll proceed under the assumption that the user wants me to design a decision tree structure using the features they provided and then code that into a Python function as per the example. Since there's no specific tree given, I'll have to make one up, choosing features and thresholds that are logical for predicting company solvency.

Let's think about the features:

The target is company solvency (1=solvent, 0=insolvent). The features are ratios like EBIT/TA, NI/TC, Sales/TA, etc. These are financial ratios that indicate the company's financial health.

Possible splits could be on ratios that indicate profitability, liquidity, or leverage. For example:

A common solvency ratio is Equity/TA (equity over total assets), which is part of the features. A higher value might indicate better solvency. So maybe a split on Equity/TA >= 0.3 (30%) could be a node.

Another feature is EBIT/Sales (operating margin). A higher EBIT/Sales ratio indicates better profitability. Maybe a split at EBIT/Sales > 0.1 (10%).

WC/TA (working capital over total assets) could indicate liquidity. A threshold like WC/TA > 0.1 might be relevant.

Let me try to construct a simple decision tree with a few splits. Let's say:

Root node: Check if Equity/TA >= 0.3.

If yes: Then check another feature, maybe EBIT/Sales. Suppose EBIT/Sales > 0.1, then solvent (1). Else, maybe check another ratio like NI/TC?

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Sales/TA, a measure of asset efficiency. High Sales/TA (like >1.2) might indicate good performance.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on EBIT/Sales. Let me think of a possible path.

Let me try to outline a possible decision tree structure:

1. First, check if EBIT/Sales > 0.05 (5% EBIT margin). If yes, proceed to check Equity/TL (equity over total liabilities). If Equity/TL >= 0.4, then solvent (1). Else, maybe check WC/TA.

Wait, perhaps:

Root node: EBIT/Sales > 0.05 (EBIT margin over 5%?)

If yes: Then check Equity/TA > 0.3. If yes, predict solvent (1). Else, check another condition like NI/Sales?

If the first split is EBIT/Sales <=0.05, then maybe check Sales/TA (sales over assets). If Sales/TA > 1.5 (high turnover), maybe still solvent, but maybe not. Alternatively, check WC/TA (working capital over assets). 

Alternatively, perhaps a different path.

This is a bit challenging without knowing the actual splits, but I need to make a plausible structure.

Let me try to create a simple decision tree with 3 levels for the example, similar to the sample given in the problem's example (which had 5 nodes). Let's say the decision tree has 5 nodes (like the example's 5 nodes) but using the given features.

Possible nodes:

Node 0: EBIT/Sales > 0.05 → if yes, proceed to node 1, else node 2.

Node 1: Equity/TA > 0.3 → if yes, predict solvent (1). Else, go to node 3.

Wait, perhaps:

Alternatively, let me think of a decision path. Let's imagine:

Start with EBIT/Sales. Suppose companies with high EBIT/Sales (like >0.05) are more likely to be solvent.

At node 0: EBIT/Sales > 0.05 → yes branch.

Then, node1: Equity/TL (equity over total liabilities) > 0.4 → solvent.

Else, node2: check another ratio like WC/TA (working capital over assets) > 0.1.

Alternatively, let me structure it step by step.

First, Node 0: EBIT/Sales > 0.05 → if yes, go to node1. Else, node2.

At node1: Equity/TA > 0.3 → if yes, predict solvent (1). Else, node3.

At node2: WC/TA > 0.1 → if yes, predict solvent (1). Else, predict 0.

Wait, but that's three nodes. Let's make it five nodes as in the example. Maybe adding more splits.

Alternatively, here's a possible structure with 5 nodes:

nodes[0] = EBIT/Sales > 0.05

nodes[1] = Equity/TA > 0.3

nodes[2] = WC/TA > 0.1

nodes[3] = NI/TC > 0.08

nodes[4] = Sales/TA > 1.2

But how to structure the if-else flow?

Let me try to outline a possible flow:

Start with node0 (EBIT/Sales > 0.05):

If node0 is True (yes):

   Check node1 (Equity/TA >0.3)

      If yes → predict 1 (solvent)

      If no → check node2 (WC/TA >0.1)

          If yes → predict 1

          Else → predict 0

Else (node0 is False):

   Check node3 (NI/TC >0.08?)

      If yes → check node4 (Sales/TA > 1.2)

          If yes → predict 1

          Else → 0

      Else → predict 0

Wait, this is getting complex. Alternatively:

Let me try to form a structure with 5 nodes as per the example:

Perhaps the code structure would have nodes[0], nodes[1], etc., and the if-else conditions based on those.

Alternatively, here's a possible decision path:

nodes[0] = (EBIT/Sales > 0.05)

nodes[1] = (Equity/TA > 0.3)

nodes[2] = (WC/TA > 0.1)

nodes[3] = (NI/Sales > -0.05) → maybe checking if net income is positive?

nodes[4] = (Sales/TA > 1.0)

The prediction flow could be:

if node0:

    if node1:

        prediction = 1

    else:

        if node2:

            prediction = 1

        else:

            prediction =0

else:

    if node3:

        if node4:

            prediction=1

        else:

            prediction=0

    else:

        prediction=0

This is just a made-up structure. The exact thresholds and features are chosen based on plausible financial ratios.

Alternatively, I can structure the nodes in a way that the example's structure is mimicked. Let me try to code it.

The function will take X as a dictionary. The features are the keys.

So the function starts with nodes = [None]*5 (assuming 5 nodes). Then each node is assigned a boolean condition based on the features.

Then the if-else statements follow the decision path.

Let me try to write the code.

Wait, let me think of the nodes:

Suppose the first split is on EBIT/Sales. Let's say:

nodes[0] = X['EBIT/Sales'] > 0.05 → if yes, go to node1.

Then node1 could be Equity/TA >0.3 → if yes, predict 1.

Else (node1 is no), then check node2 (WC/TA >0.1). If yes → 1, else 0.

If the first condition (node0) is false, then check another path, like node3 (NI/Sales > -0.1 → maybe net income isn't too negative?), and then node4 (Sales/TA >1.2?)

Alternatively, here's a possible code structure:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/Sales'] > 0.05
    nodes[1] = X['Equity/TA'] > 0.3
    nodes[2] = X['WC/TA'] > 0.1
    nodes[3] = X['NI/Sales'] > -0.05
    nodes[4] = X['Sales/TA'] > 1.2

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but this uses nodes 0,1,2 and 3,4. That's 5 nodes. Let me check the structure.

The example function had nodes[0] to nodes[4], and the if-else logic uses them in a nested way.

The above code uses 5 nodes, which matches the example's structure. The thresholds are chosen as plausible values. For instance:

- EBIT/Sales (operating margin) over 5% is reasonable.

- Equity/TA (equity to total assets) over 30% might indicate enough equity.

- WC/TA (working capital over assets) over 10% could be a liquidity check.

- NI/Sales (net income over sales) should be above -5% to not be too loss-making.

- Sales/TA over 1.2 implies high asset turnover.

This is a plausible setup.

Alternatively, maybe node4 is something else. But this is a possible approach.

Another consideration: the target is 1 for solvent. So the leaves should have 1 or 0 based on the splits.

In the code above, the paths:

If EBIT/Sales is high (node0 yes), then if Equity/TA is good (node1 yes), then solvent (1). If Equity is low, but WC/TA is okay (node2 yes), then solvent. Else, not.

If EBIT/Sales is low (node0 no), then check if NI/Sales isn't too bad (node3 yes). Then check Sales/TA high (node4 yes) → solvent. Else not.

Else (node3 no) → insolvent.

This makes sense.

I think this structure is okay. The code should look like that, with the nodes assigned as per the features and thresholds.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/Sales'] > 0.05
    nodes[1] = X['Equity/TA'] > 0.3
    nodes[2] = X['WC/TA'] > 0.1
    nodes[3] = X['NI/Sales'] > -0.05
    nodes[4] = X['Sales/TA'] > 1.2

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

The decision tree is structured to evaluate company solvency using financial ratios. The nodes and thresholds are chosen based on plausible financial health indicators:

1. **Node 0 (EBIT/Sales > 0.05):**  
   A positive operating margin (EBIT/Sales) above 5% suggests operational profitability. Companies with higher margins are more likely to be solvent.

2. **Node 1 (Equity/TA > 0.3):**  
   Equity as a proportion of total assets (≥30%) indicates strong capital structure, reducing insolvency risk.

3. **Node 2 (WC/TA > 0.1):**  
   Working capital adequacy (≥10% of assets) ensures liquidity to meet short-term obligations, improving solvency.

4. **Node 3 (NI/Sales > -0.05):**  
   Net income must not be overly negative (>-5% of sales). Even if losses exist, they are manageable.

5. **Node 4 (Sales/TA > 1.2):**  
   High asset turnover (sales >120% of assets) implies efficient asset utilization, supporting solvency even if margins are low.

**Decision Flow:**
- **If EBIT/Sales > 5%:**  
  Check equity strength (Node 1). If insufficient, liquidity (Node 2) determines solvency.
- **If EBIT/Sales ≤5%:**  
  Check if net income isn't too negative (Node 3). If true, sales efficiency (Node 4) decides solvency; otherwise, default to insolvent.
