<think>

Okay, so I need to create a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 using the provided financial features to determine if a company is solvent or not. Let me start by understanding the problem and the features given.

First, the features are all ratios related to the company's financial health. The target variable is solvency, which I assume is a binary classification: solvent (maybe 1) or not solvent (0). The example given uses the iris dataset with petal width as the key feature, so I need to figure out which of these financial ratios are the most important for predicting solvency.

The features provided are:

1. Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets (EBIT/TA)
2. Net Income/Total Capital (NI/TC)
3. Sales/Total Assets (S/TA)
4. Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Sales (EBIT/Sales)
5. Net Income/Sales (NI/Sales)
6. Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA)
7. Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL)
8. Equity/Total Assets (E/TA)

I need to select the two most important features to build a decision tree of depth 2. Since I can't compute information gain or Gini impurity here, I have to rely on domain knowledge and common financial metrics used for solvency.

Solvency is about a company's ability to meet its long-term debts. Common ratios for solvency include Debt to Equity, Equity/Total Liabilities, and others. Let me think about each feature:

- **EBIT/TA**: Measures how well a company uses its assets to generate earnings. Not sure how directly related to solvency.
- **NI/TC**: Net income over total capital, indicating profitability relative to capital. Profitability is important but maybe more for liquidity?
- **Sales/TA**: Asset turnover, efficiency. Not sure.
- **EBIT/Sales**: Profit margin before interest and taxes. Higher is better, but again profitability.
- **NI/Sales**: Net profit margin. Similar to above.
- **WC/TA**: Working Capital as a ratio of Total Assets. Working capital is more about short-term liquidity.
- **E/TL**: Equity divided by Total Liabilities. This ratio is directly related to solvency. A higher ratio means more equity relative to debt, better solvency.
- **E/TA**: Equity/Total Assets. This is the equity ratio, which is a key solvency measure. Higher ratios indicate better solvency.

So, between E/TL and E/TA, these are both equity-based ratios. Since the question says to use the most important features, maybe E/TA is more standard. However, perhaps the working capital ratio (WC/TA) is also important for short-term solvency, but the problem says solvency in general, which might be more long-term.

Alternatively, another key solvency ratio is Debt to Equity, which isn't directly listed here. Wait, E/TL is equity over total liabilities, which is similar to 1/(Debt/Equity). So a higher E/TL would mean less debt relative to equity, so better solvency.

Between E/TL and E/TA, perhaps E/TA is more straightforward because it's the proportion of assets financed by equity. Let's consider both as candidates.

Other features might not be as directly related. For example, Sales/TA is efficiency, not solvency. EBIT/Sales is a profitability ratio.

So, the most important features are likely Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL) and Equity/Total Assets (E/TA). Maybe also Working Capital/TA for short-term, but if depth is 2, perhaps only two splits.

Wait, the maximum depth is 2, so the tree can have two levels. The root node is the first split, then each child can have another split, but no deeper than 2. So the tree would have two splits at maximum, leading to up to four leaves, but with a max depth of 2, meaning the root has two children, each of those can have two children, but total depth is 2, so leaves are at depth 2.

Wait, the example given had a root split, then each branch had another split (so depth 2). So the structure is:

Root node (depth 1) splits into two branches (depth 2 leaves?), or perhaps the root is depth 0? Hmm, maybe the depth is counted as the number of splits. The example tree has a depth of 2 because the longest path from root to leaf is two splits (root split to first level, then another split on the right side). So depth 2 allows two layers of splits.

Therefore, the decision tree would have one split at the root, then each of those branches can have another split, but not more.

So, I need to choose the first split as the most important feature, then the second splits as the next important ones.

Assuming that Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL) and Equity/Total Assets (E/TA) are the top two features, perhaps the first split is on one of them, then the next on the other.

Alternatively, maybe Working Capital/TA is also important. Let's see:

Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities. A positive WC indicates the company can meet short-term obligations. So WC/TA would be a ratio indicating liquidity, which is part of solvency but more short-term. However, the problem might consider solvency in a broader sense.

In any case, considering common solvency ratios, Equity/Total Assets (E/TA) is a key one because it shows the proportion of assets financed by equity rather than debt. A higher ratio implies better solvency.

Alternatively, Debt to Equity ratio (which is Total Liabilities/Equity, so inverse of E/TL). Since E/TL = Equity / Total Liabilities, that's like the inverse. A higher E/TL means lower debt relative to equity.

So both E/TL and E/TA are important. Let's pick the one that's more predictive. Maybe E/TA is better because it's a direct measure of how much of the company's assets are funded by equity. Let's suppose the first split is on E/TA.

Suppose the first split is E/TA <= threshold. If a company has E/TA below a certain threshold, maybe it's not solvent. The threshold would be determined by the data, but since I don't have data, I have to make a reasonable guess. Maybe a threshold like 0.4 (40% equity) – if below that, not solvent; above, check another feature.

Then, the next split on the other side (those above E/TA 0.4) might use another feature like E/TL. Suppose for those with high E/TA, we check their E/TL. If E/TL is above a certain value, they're solvent, otherwise not. Alternatively, maybe use Working Capital/TA here for the second split.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on E/TL. Let's think through both scenarios.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Working Capital/TA. Let's see:

If the first split is WC/TA <= threshold (say 0.2), meaning working capital is low relative to assets, then maybe the company is not solvent. But this is more short-term. Since the problem is solvency in general, perhaps long-term is more important. But maybe combining both.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on E/TA. Suppose the decision tree would first check if Equity/TA is above a certain threshold. Let's say if E/TA > 0.3 (30% equity), then proceed to check another ratio, else classify as not solvent. The second split could be on E/TL. For example, if E/TA is high, then check E/TL. If E/TL is above 0.5, then solvent; else, maybe not. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on E/TL. For instance, if E/TL is above 0.5 (meaning equity is more than half of liabilities), then solvent; else, check another ratio like WC/TA.

But since the user's example used the most discriminative feature first (petal width in iris), which splits the data into classes, perhaps here the best split is the one that best separates solvency. Since I don't have data, I have to pick based on knowledge.

Another thought: the Equity/Total Assets ratio (E/TA) is a common solvency ratio. If a company has a high equity ratio (say >0.4), they are solvent. Below that, maybe check another ratio like Working Capital/TA. For instance:

Root node split on E/TA:

- If E/TA > 0.4 → solvent (maybe, but not sure)
- If E/TA <=0.4 → then split on Working Capital/TA. Suppose if WC/TA >0.2 → solvent, else not.

Alternatively, the second split could be on another equity ratio like E/TL.

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on Net Income/Sales (profitability), but that might not be as directly related.

Alternatively, the first split on E/TA, then on EBIT/Sales (profit margin). But again, need to think of what's more important.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to pick the two features that are most critical for solvency. Since E/TA and E/TL are both equity-related, but let's go with E/TA as the first split. Let me try to structure it.

Assuming the first split is on Equity/Total Assets (E/TA). Let's set a threshold of 0.3 (30%). If a company has E/TA >0.3, it might be solvent, but maybe not always. Then, for those above, check another feature like Working Capital/TA. If WC/TA is above a threshold (like 0.1), then solvent; else, maybe not solvent. But this is just a guess.

Wait, but the example given for the iris dataset used a simple structure with the first split on a key feature, and then on the same feature in the next split. Maybe here, the first split is on E/TA, and the next splits on the same feature again, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, the second split is on a different feature.

Alternatively, the first split is E/TA <= 0.3 → not solvent. Else, go to the next split on E/TL. For example:

Root: E/TA > 0.3?

- If Yes: Split on E/TL > 0.5 → solvent; else, maybe not solvent (since even with decent equity, if equity is less than half liabilities, maybe not solvent)
- If No: Not solvent

Alternatively, if E/TA is low (<=0.3), classify as not solvent. If high, check E/TL, and if that's also good, classify as solvent, else maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is E/TL. Suppose threshold 0.5:

- If E/TL >0.5 → solvent
- Else, check another feature like E/TA. Suppose if E/TA >0.2 → solvent else not.

Hmm, but this requires making up thresholds. Since I can't compute actual splits, I have to make reasonable assumptions.

Alternatively, perhaps the two most important features are E/TA and Working Capital/TA. Let me try building the tree with that.

Root split: E/TA > 0.3?

- If yes → Split on Working Capital/TA > 0.1 → solvent; else, maybe not solvent
- If no → Not solvent

Alternatively, maybe the second split on E/TL.

Alternatively, another approach: the two most important features are E/TA and E/TL. So the first split is on E/TA, then the second on E/TL.

Let me structure it as:

Root node: E/TA <= 0.4?

- If yes → solvent? Or not? Hmm, maybe if E/TA is low, it's not solvent. Wait, if E/TA is low, meaning more debt, so maybe not solvent. Wait, let me think:

Wait, E/TA is equity over total assets. A higher ratio means more equity, less debt. So if E/TA is below a threshold (say 0.3), then the company is likely not solvent. So:

Root split: E/TA > 0.3 → proceed to second split; else, classify as not solvent (left branch).

Then, for the right branch (E/TA >0.3), split on another feature like E/TL.

Suppose the second split is E/TL >0.5 → solvent; else, maybe not solvent.

Wait, but then the right child would have two branches. So the tree would be:

|--- E/TA > 0.3?
||--- E/TL > 0.5 → solvent
||--- E/TL <=0.5 → not solvent
|--- E/TA <=0.3 → not solvent

But is that possible? So the first split is E/TA, then within those with high E/TA, check E/TL. But maybe that's a valid structure.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on E/TL. Let's see:

Root split: E/TL > 0.5?

- If yes → solvent
- If no → check another feature, say E/TA. Suppose if E/TA >0.2 → solvent else not.

This way:

|--- E/TL >0.5 → solvent
|--- E/TL <=0.5 → 
||--- E/TA >0.2 → solvent
||--- E/TA <=0.2 → not solvent

That could be another structure.

Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to pick the two features that together can best split the data. Since I can't compute, I have to choose the most logical ones.

Given that E/TA is a primary solvency ratio, and E/TL is another, perhaps the first split is on E/TA, then the second on E/TL.

Alternatively, maybe Working Capital/TA is more critical for short-term solvency, but the question says solvency generally. However, if the company is not solvent in the short term, it might not survive long-term.

Alternatively, let's think of typical financial analysis: a company with low equity (E/TA) and low working capital (WC/TA) is at risk.

Suppose the first split is E/TA. If E/TA is too low, they're not solvent. If it's okay, check another factor like WC/TA.

So:

Root: E/TA >0.3?

- Yes → Split on WC/TA >0.1 → solvent; else, not
- No → Not solvent

This would make a depth 2 tree.

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on E/TL instead.

Alternatively, let me think of another angle: the user's example used a single feature for splitting, then split again on the same feature. For instance, petal width was used twice. Maybe here, the same feature can be used again? But perhaps different thresholds.

Wait, in the example, the first split was on petal width <=0.8, leading to setosa. The other branch then split on petal width again but higher threshold. So same feature used twice in different branches.

Hmm, so maybe here, using the same feature again might make sense if it's the most discriminative. But given that I have other features, perhaps it's better to use different ones.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Working Capital/TA, then on E/TA.

But in the absence of data, I have to make an educated guess. Let's proceed with Equity/Total Assets as the first split, then Equity/Total Liabilities as the second.

Let me try to structure the decision tree with these.

First, the root node uses E/TA. Suppose the threshold is 0.35.

- If E/TA > 0.35 → proceed to next split
- Else → classify as Not Solvent

Then, the next split on E/TL with a threshold of 0.5:

- If E/TL >0.5 → Solvent
- Else → Not Solvent

Thus, the tree would look like:

|--- Equity/Total Assets > 0.35?
||--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 0.5 → Solvent
||--- Equity/Total Liabilities <= 0.5 → Not Solvent
|--- Equity/Total Assets <= 0.35 → Not Solvent

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on another feature, like Working Capital/TA. Let's say if after high E/TA, check WC/TA:

Root split: E/TA >0.35 → then split on WC/TA >0.2 → solvent else not.

But maybe that's better for short-term.

Alternatively, the second split on Net Income/Sales (profitability). But I think equity ratios are more directly related to solvency.

Another consideration: the example used a binary split each time, so each internal node has exactly two children. The user's example had three leaves because one branch was a leaf (setosa), and the other branch split again. Wait, in their example:

The root was petal width <=0.8 → setosa (leaf)

Else, go to petal width <=1.75 → versicolor, and else → virginica.

So total three leaves, with the right branch having another split. So depth is 2 because the path from root to virginica is two splits.

Therefore, in my case, the tree should have at most three leaves? Or up to four? Wait, depth 2 allows for up to 2^2 =4 leaves. But perhaps the structure can be:

Root split (depth 1) → two children (depth 2 leaves?), but if one of them splits again, then depth 2 would have three leaves? Wait, maybe my understanding is off. Let me think again.

The depth is measured as the length of the longest path from root to leaf. So if the root has a child that is a leaf, and the other child splits again, then the depth would be 2 (since the path to the grandchild is two edges). So the maximum depth is 2, which means some paths have two edges. So in that structure, the left branch is a leaf, and the right branch splits into two leaves, totaling three leaves.

Therefore, following the example's structure, maybe the first split leads to one leaf and one further split.

So perhaps:

Root split: E/TA >0.35?

- If yes → split on E/TL >0.5 → solvent (leaf) or Not (leaf)
- If no → Not Solvent (leaf)

Thus, three leaves, depth 2.

Alternatively, first split on E/TL:

Root: E/TL >0.5?

- If yes → solvent (leaf)
- If no → split on E/TA >0.35 → solvent or not.

Thus:

|--- E/TL >0.5 → solvent
|--- E/TL <=0.5 →
||--- E/TA >0.35 → solvent
||--- E/TA <=0.35 → not solvent

This way, three leaves, depth 2.

This might be a better structure, as the first split on E/TL can immediately classify some as solvent, and others needing further evaluation.

Alternatively, perhaps the most critical is E/TA, so if that's low, definitely not solvent. If high, then need to check another factor.

Alternatively, let me think of real-world scenarios. A company with high equity (E/TA) is solvent, but if equity is low, but they have good working capital (WC/TA), maybe they can stay solvent.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on WC/TA, then on E/TA.

But since I need to choose, let me proceed with the first example I thought of.

Final decision: I'll structure the tree with E/TA as the first split, then E/TL as the second.

Thresholds chosen as 0.35 and 0.5 respectively, but since exact values are arbitrary, I can present it with variables.

Alternatively, to make it similar to the example, use the same feature again? Let me see:

Suppose first split on E/TA <=0.3 → Not solvent.

Else, split again on E/TA >0.5 → solvent. Else, Not solvent.

But that might not make sense. Alternatively, using different thresholds for the same feature in different branches.

Alternatively, perhaps the best is to pick Equity/Total Assets and Working Capital/Total Assets as the two features.

Thus:

Root: E/TA >0.3?

- Yes → Split on WC/TA >0.1 → solvent; else, not solvent
- No → Not solvent

Alternatively, the user might expect using the two most critical features, which are both equity ratios.

Alternatively, let me present the tree with the first split on Equity/Total Assets and the second on Equity/Total Liabilities.

Final structure:

|--- Equity/Total Assets > 0.35?
||--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 0.5 → Solvent
||--- Equity/Total Liabilities ≤ 0.5 → Not Solvent
|--- Equity/Total Assets ≤ 0.35 → Not Solvent

Alternatively, using different numbers for thresholds:

Alternatively, first split at E/TA > 0.2:

- If yes → split on E/TL >0.4 → solvent; else → not
- If no → not solvent

But since I have to pick numbers, perhaps go with 0.3 and 0.5.

Alternatively, to make it similar to the example's petal width splits (0.8 and 1.7), perhaps pick 0.35 and then 0.6.

Alternatively, let's just present with variables.

Alternatively, perhaps the user expects the two most important features to be E/TA and WC/TA, so the tree would be:

Root: E/TA > 0.3?

- Yes → Split on WC/TA >0.1 → solvent; else → Not
- No → Not solvent

Alternatively, but I need to decide.

Given that in the absence of data, the most standard solvency ratios are:

- Debt to Equity Ratio (D/E = Total Debt / Total Equity), but that's not exactly in the given features. However, Equity/Total Liabilities (or E/TL) is Equity / Total Liabilities, which is the inverse of D/E.

Alternatively, Equity/Total Assets is a solvency ratio showing how much of the assets are funded by equity.

Thus, perhaps the first split on E/TA, then on E/TL.

Hence, I'll go with that structure and present it as:

Root node: Equity/Total Assets > 0.35?

- If yes → proceed to check Equity/Total Liabilities > 0.5 → solvent
- If Equity/Total Liabilities ≤ 0.5 → not solvent
- If no → Not solvent

Thus, the decision tree would be:

|--- Equity/Total Assets > 0.35?
||--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 0.5 → Solvent
||--- Equity/Total Liabilities ≤ 0.5 → Not Solvent
|--- Equity/Total Assets ≤ 0.35 → Not Solvent

Alternatively, to match the example's structure where one branch leads directly to a leaf and the other splits again, perhaps:

Root node: Equity/Total Assets > 0.3?

- If yes → proceed to split on another feature (e.g., Equity/Total Liabilities > 0.5 → solvent else not)
- If no → Not solvent

But to have the same feature in the second split would require a different threshold in the other branch, but maybe it's okay.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Equity/Total Liabilities:

Root node: Equity/Total Liabilities > 0.5?

- If yes → Solvent
- If no → split on Equity/Total Assets >0.3 → solvent else not.

This way:

|--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 0.5 → Solvent
|--- Equity/Total Liabilities ≤ 0.5 →
||--- Equity/Total Assets >0.3 → Solvent
||--- Equity/Total Assets ≤0.3 → Not Solvent

This structure might also be valid. It classifies those with high equity over liabilities as solvent, and those with lower but still decent assets equity as solvent, else not.

Alternatively, this might be better because even with lower equity over liabilities, if assets are sufficiently funded by equity, they might still be solvent.

Given that, this structure could be better.

Alternatively, to avoid confusion between the two equity ratios, perhaps this approach is more intuitive.

Thus, the decision tree would look like:

Root node: Equity/Total Liabilities > 0.5?

- If yes → Solvent (leaf)
- If no → Split on Equity/Total Assets >0.3 →
  - If yes → Solvent (leaf)
  - If no → Not Solvent (leaf)

This way, three leaves, with depth 2.

This seems reasonable because:

- High equity relative to liabilities → solvent
- Lower equity relative to liabilities, but sufficient equity in assets → solvent
- Both low → not solvent

This might capture different scenarios.

Alternatively, perhaps the threshold for E/TA should be lower if E/TL is low. But since we can't compute, this is a plausible structure.

Given that the user's example had three leaves with one split leading directly to a leaf, this structure mirrors that.

Therefore, I'll present this decision tree:

|--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 0.5 → Solvent
|--- Equity/Total Liabilities ≤ 0.5 →
||--- Equity/Total Assets > 0.3 → Solvent
||--- Equity/Total Assets ≤ 0.3 → Not Solvent

This uses two different features, with the first split on E/TL and the second on E/TA, resulting in depth 2.
</think>

The decision tree for assessing solvency using the most critical features is structured as follows:

1. **Root Node**: Check if **Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL)** is greater than 0.5.
   - **If Yes**: Classify as **SOLVENT** (directly).
   - **If No**: Proceed to the next split.

2. **Second Split**: For companies with **E/TL ≤ 0.5**, check if **Equity/Total Assets (E/TA)** is greater than 0.3.
   - **If Yes**: Classify as **SOLVENT**.
   - **If No**: Classify as **NOT SOLVENT**.

### Decision Tree Structure:
```
|--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 0.5 → **SOLVENT**
|--- Equity/Total Liabilities ≤ 0.5 →
||--- Equity/Total Assets > 0.3 → **SOLVENT**
||--- Equity/Total Assets ≤ 0.3 → **NOT SOLVENT**
```

### Explanation:
- **First Split (E/TL > 0.5)**: A high equity-to-liabilities ratio indicates sufficient equity to cover liabilities, directly classifying the company as solvent.
- **Second Split (E/TA > 0.3)**: For companies with weaker equity relative to liabilities, a higher equity-to-assets ratio suggests adequate equity funding of assets, potentially maintaining solvency.
- **Final Classification**: If both conditions fail, the company is deemed **not solvent**.

This structure mirrors the example's format, ensuring clarity and logical progression. The thresholds (0.5 and 0.3) are illustrative and can be adjusted based on specific industry standards or empirical data.

<think>

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants a Python function that implements a decision tree based on the provided features and target variable. The function should return a prediction and a list indicating which inner nodes were satisfied (1) or not (0). 

First, I need to understand the features and the target. The features are all ratios like EBIT/TA, NI/TC, etc., and the target is whether the company is solvent (1) or not (0). The example given in the problem shows how a decision tree is structured with nodes and conditions.

Wait, the user mentioned that the decision tree's thresholds might have placeholders. Since they didn't provide the actual decision tree structure, maybe I need to assume a simple structure based on common financial ratios that indicate solvency? Or perhaps the user expects me to create a hypothetical decision tree using these features with plausible thresholds? The example given in the problem uses HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level with specific thresholds. Since the user's own features are financial ratios, I need to come up with reasonable thresholds for those.

Hmm, but the problem says "if your decision tree has placeholders for thresholds, try to fill them with meaningful values." Wait, but I don't have a decision tree structure provided here. The user must have intended that I construct a decision tree based on the features provided. However, maybe the problem is that the user expects me to create a simple decision tree structure using these features, choosing which feature to split on first, then next, etc., with appropriate thresholds.

Since the example was depth 2, perhaps the user expects a depth 2 tree here as well? Let me check the example again: the example has two nodes (depth 2) and the function includes nodes[0] and nodes[1]. So perhaps the function here should also have a similar structure.

But since I don't have the actual decision tree structure, maybe I should make an educated guess. Let me think of common solvency ratios. For instance, Equity/TA (Equity over Total Assets) is a measure of solvency. A higher ratio indicates better solvency. Maybe a threshold like 0.3? Or another ratio like EBIT/Sales (operating profit margin). Maybe if EBIT/Sales is above a certain value, the company is solvent.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on EBIT/Sales. Let's say if EBIT/Sales is greater than 0.05, then go one way; else, another. Then the next split could be on Equity/TA, say above 0.4, etc. I need to choose thresholds that make sense. Since I'm making this up, I have to pick plausible numbers. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Equity/TL (Equity over Total Liabilities). A higher ratio would mean more equity to cover liabilities, better solvency. Maybe a threshold of 0.5? So if Equity/TL > 0.5, then solvent, else check other factors. 

Alternatively, the first split could be on WC/TA (Working Capital over Total Assets). A positive working capital (WC) means current assets exceed current liabilities, so maybe WC/TA > 0.1 is good. 

Hmm, I need to structure this. Let's say the first node is EBIT/Sales <= 0.05. If yes, then check another node. Let's structure it as a depth 2 tree. Let me think of a possible decision tree structure:

Root node: EBIT/Sales <= 0.05. If yes, then check next node (maybe NI/Sales <= 0.03). If both are true, predict 0 (insolvent). Else, predict 1. If the first is no (EBIT/Sales > 0.05), then maybe the company is solvent, so predict 1. But then nodes would be two levels. Or perhaps the second node is on Equity/TA. 

Alternatively, the first split could be on Equity/TA. Suppose the root node is Equity/TA <= 0.3. If yes, then check next node, say WC/TA <= 0.1. If both are true, predict 0. Else, maybe 1. 

Alternatively, let me think of the example given. The example uses two nodes, each with a threshold on a feature. So in the function, nodes[0] is the first split, and nodes[1] is the next split in the left branch (since depth 2). The structure is similar.

Let me try to come up with a plausible decision tree for solvency. Here's an idea:

The root node could split on EBIT/Sales (operating margin). Suppose the threshold is 0.05 (5%). If EBIT/Sales is less than or equal to 0.05, then the company might be at risk. Then, the next split in that left branch could be on Equity/TL (equity over total liabilities). If Equity/TL is <= 0.4, then predict insolvent (0), else maybe solvent. Alternatively, if the first condition is not met (EBIT/Sales > 0.05), then predict solvent (1).

So, nodes[0] would be X['EBIT/Sales'] <= 0.05. The second node (nodes[1]) would be X['Equity/TL'] <= 0.4. 

Putting this into code:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0] * 2  # two nodes
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/Sales'] <= 0.05
    nodes[1] = X['Equity/TL'] <= 0.4

    if nodes[0]:  # EBIT/Sales <= 0.05
        if nodes[1]:  # Equity/TL <= 0.4
            prediction = 0  # insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # solvent
    else:  # EBIT/Sales >0.05
        prediction = 1  # solvent

    return prediction, nodes

But I need to make sure that the features are spelled exactly as given. The features list includes 'EBIT/Sales', 'Equity/TL', so that's correct. The target is 1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent. 

Alternatively, maybe the second node is on another feature. Let me think again. Alternatively, the second node could be NI/Sales. Suppose after EBIT/Sales <=0.05, then check NI/Sales. But I need to pick thresholds that make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on Equity/TA (equity over total assets). Maybe a threshold of 0.3. If Equity/TA <=0.3, then check another feature like WC/TA. 

Alternatively, another approach. Let me think of typical solvency ratios:

- Equity/TA (higher is better)
- EBIT/Sales (higher is better)
- NI/Sales (net profit margin, higher is better)
- WC/TA (working capital ratio, higher is better, but maybe a threshold like 0.1?)

But since I can choose any features and thresholds, as long as they are plausible, I can proceed. 

Alternatively, another structure: first split on EBIT/Sales <=0.05. If yes, then check Sales/TA (asset turnover). Maybe if Sales/TA is <=1.0, then predict 0. 

But I need to make sure that the code structure matches the example. The example has nodes as a list where each element corresponds to an inner node. Since it's a depth 2 tree, there are two nodes (the root and one child node on the left branch). 

Alternatively, perhaps the root is on EBIT/TA, but I need to think of a ratio. 

Alternatively, here's another possible structure:

Root node: Equity/TL <= 0.5 (if equity is less than half of total liabilities, maybe insolvent). If yes, then check another feature like NI/Sales <= 0.02. If both are true, then 0, else maybe 1.

But again, the thresholds are just made up but should be plausible. 

Alternatively, looking at the example's thresholds (HbA1c_level <=6.7 and blood_glucose_level <=210). The thresholds are in the middle of possible ranges. For EBIT/Sales, which is a ratio between 0 and maybe 1, so 0.05 is a low value.

Let me proceed with the first idea I had, where the first node is EBIT/Sales <=0.05, and the second node is Equity/TL <=0.4. That seems plausible. So the code would be as above. 

Wait, but in the example, nodes are stored as a list of two elements, and the function returns them. The nodes list should have 1s and 0s indicating if the condition was met. For instance, in the example, nodes[0] is the first condition (HbA1c_level <=6.7). If that is true, then nodes[0] is 1 (since it's stored as a boolean, but in the problem statement, the list entries should be 1 or 0. Wait, the example shows that in the code, nodes[0] is set to the boolean result. But in the problem statement, they want the entries to be 1 or 0. Wait, the example's code uses booleans, but then when returning, the nodes are lists with True/False. But in the problem's instruction, it says "the entries of this list should be 1 if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, and 0 otherwise." So the nodes list should be integers 0 or 1, not booleans. 

Ah, right! That's important. So in the example, they probably should have converted the booleans to integers. Wait looking at the example code provided in the problem:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["HbA1c_level"] <= 6.7
    nodes[1] = X["blood_glucose_level"] <= 210
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes

But in that code, the nodes are stored as booleans (True/False). But according to the problem's instruction, the entries should be 1 or 0. So perhaps the example is just illustrative and the user expects the actual code to store integers (1 or 0) instead of booleans. Therefore, in my code, I need to cast the boolean conditions to integers. 

Wait, but in Python, True is 1 and False is 0 when converted to integers. So when returning the list, if nodes are stored as booleans, then converting them to integers would be necessary. 

Wait the problem says: "the entries of this list should be 1 if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, and 0 otherwise." So the list should contain integers, not booleans. Therefore, in the code, each node entry should be an integer. 

Therefore, in my code, I should set nodes[0] as an integer (1 or 0), not a boolean. 

Wait, but in the example provided by the user, the code does not do that. The example uses:

nodes[0] = X["HbA1c_level"] <= 6.7

Which is a boolean, but the problem says to return 1 or 0. Therefore, perhaps the user expects that the nodes list is built as integers. So in my code, I need to cast the boolean to an integer. 

Therefore, in my code, I should do:

nodes[0] = int(X['EBIT/Sales'] <= 0.05)

nodes[1] = int(X['Equity/TL'] <= 0.4)

That way, each node is stored as 1 or 0. 

So, correcting that, my function would look like:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0, 0]
    nodes[0] = int(X['EBIT/Sales'] <= 0.05)
    nodes[1] = int(X['Equity/TL'] <= 0.4)
    
    if nodes[0]:  # EBIT/Sales <=0.05 (so nodes[0] is 1)
        if nodes[1]:  # Equity/TL <=0.4 (nodes[1] is 1)
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:  # EBIT/Sales >0.05
        prediction = 1  # solvent

    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but the example's code uses booleans, but in their code's output, they return the nodes as booleans. However, the problem says the entries should be 1 or 0, so maybe the user expects the integers. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's example is just using booleans, and the user is okay with that, but the problem's instruction says to return 1 or 0. Hmm. To comply with the instruction, it's better to return integers. 

Another point: the features are given as ['EBIT/TA', 'NI/TC', 'Sales/TA', 'EBIT/Sales', 'NI/Sales', 'WC/TA', 'Equity/TL', 'Equity/TA', 'Target variable', 'target']. The keys are exact, so I must use them correctly. For example, 'Equity/TL' is the key for that feature. 

The target variable is 'target', which is 1 for solvent and 0 for insolvent. 

So the decision tree logic I chose should lead to those predictions. 

Is there a better choice of features? Maybe. For instance, using Equity/TA instead of Equity/TL. Suppose another possible structure:

First split on Equity/TA <= 0.4. If yes, then check another feature like NI/Sales. 

Alternatively, let's see if there's a better ratio. For example, the current ratio (WC/TA) being below a threshold might indicate insolvency. 

Suppose I choose:

Root node: WC/TA <= 0.2. If yes (low working capital relative to assets), then check another feature like EBIT/Sales. 

But I need to pick thresholds that make sense. 

Alternatively, let me think of another structure. Suppose the first node is Sales/TA (asset turnover) <= 1.0. A lower asset turnover might indicate issues. Then, the next node could be EBIT/Sales. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first node is NI/Sales (Net Income/Sales). If that's <= 0.02, then the company is not profitable enough. Then check another ratio like Equity/TL. 

Hmm. It's a bit tricky without more context, but I'll proceed with the first idea I had. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Equity/TA (equity over total assets), which is a measure of how much of the assets are financed by equity. A higher ratio is better. Suppose the threshold is 0.3. 

First node: Equity/TA <= 0.3. If yes, then check another feature, like EBIT/Sales. 

Suppose second node: EBIT/Sales <= 0.05. If both are true, then insolvent. 

But then the code would be:

nodes[0] = int(X['Equity/TA'] <= 0.3)

nodes[1] = int(X['EBIT/Sales'] <=0.05)

Then, if both are 1, prediction 0. Else, 1. 

But I think the initial approach is okay. 

Alternatively, to make sure that the code is correct, I can choose another example. Let's see:

Suppose a company has EBIT/Sales of 0.06 (so above 0.05), so nodes[0] is 0. Then prediction is 1 (solvent). 

If EBIT/Sales is 0.04 (<=0.05), then nodes[0] is 1. Then check Equity/TL: suppose Equity/TL is 0.3 (<=0.4), nodes[1] is 1. Then prediction is 0 (insolvent). 

If Equity/TL is 0.5 (>0.4), then nodes[1] is 0, so prediction is 1 (solvent). 

This seems reasonable. 

Alternatively, perhaps using a more common solvency ratio like Debt to Equity, but since we have Equity/TL, which is similar. 

Since the features available include Equity/TL (equity divided by total liabilities), a low value here would indicate more reliance on liabilities, which is risky. 

Therefore, choosing Equity/TL <=0.4 as the second node makes sense. 

Therefore, I think my initial code is okay. 

Now, making sure the code is written correctly with the exact feature names and the correct integer conversion. 

So the final code would be:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0, 0]
    nodes[0] = int(X['EBIT/Sales'] <= 0.05)
    nodes[1] = int(X['Equity/TL'] <= 0.4)
    
    if nodes[0]:  # EBIT/Sales <=0.05
        if nodes[1]:  # Equity/TL <=0.4
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:  # EBIT/Sales >0.05
        prediction = 1
    
    return prediction, nodes

Alternatively, maybe the second node should be on another feature. Let me see if there is a better choice. 

Suppose first node is 'EBIT/TA' (EBIT over total assets) <= some threshold. For example, EBIT/TA represents how much EBIT is generated per dollar of assets. Suppose the threshold is 0.05. 

nodes[0] = int(X['EBIT/TA'] <=0.05)

If yes, then check another feature like NI/Sales. 

But without more info, it's hard to choose. Since I have to pick something, I'll stick with the initial plan. 

Alternatively, perhaps to make the code more accurate, let's think of typical thresholds. 

For EBIT/Sales (operating profit margin), a company with less than 5% might be in trouble, so the first threshold makes sense. 

Equity/TL: if equity is less than 40% of total liabilities, that's high debt. 

Yes, so that seems reasonable. 

Therefore, the code should be as above. 

Another check: what if both conditions are true? Then prediction is 0 (insolvent), which makes sense. If either condition is not met, it's solvent. 

Alternatively, maybe if Equity/TL is high (over 40%), even if EBIT is low, it's still solvent. 

Alternatively, maybe the second node should be on a different metric. 

Alternatively, perhaps the second node is on 'WC/TA' (working capital over total assets). Suppose if WC/TA is <=0.2, then insolvent. 

But I need to pick two features and thresholds. 

Alternatively, let me pick another structure for better performance. 

Suppose first node is 'Equity/TA' <=0.3 (so equity is less than 30% of assets, which might indicate high leverage). 

Then, second node is 'EBIT/Sales' <=0.05. 

If both are true, then 0, else 1. 

But without knowing the actual data, it's hard to tell, but the problem doesn't require accuracy, just to follow the instructions. 

Therefore, I'll proceed with the initial code. 

Final code:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0, 0]
    nodes[0] = int(X['EBIT/Sales'] <= 0.05)
    nodes[1] = int(X['Equity/TL'] <= 0.4)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 1
    
    return prediction, nodes

Yes, this should work.
