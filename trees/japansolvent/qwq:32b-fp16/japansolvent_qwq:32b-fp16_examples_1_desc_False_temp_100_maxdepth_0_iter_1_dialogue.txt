<think>

Okay, so I need to create a decision tree classifier using the given financial features to determine if a company is solvent or not. Let me start by recalling what solvency means. A solvent company can meet its long-term obligations, so the features provided are all ratios that might indicate that. 

First, let me list out the features again to make sure I have them all:

1. Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets (EBIT/TA)
2. Net Income/Total Capital (NI/TC)
3. Sales/Total Assets (S/TA)
4. Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Sales (EBIT/Sales)
5. Net Income/Sales (NI/Sales)
6. Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA)
7. Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL)
8. Equity/Total Assets (E/TA)

The goal is to classify a company as solvent or not. Now, decision trees work by splitting the data based on the feature that provides the most information gain or the best split. Since I don't have actual data, I need to think which of these ratios are most critical for solvency.

Starting with the features, some of them are profitability ratios like EBIT/TA, NI/TC, EBIT/Sales, NI/Sales. These measure how profitable the company is. Then there are efficiency ratios like Sales/TA, which shows how well assets are used. The working capital ratio (WC/TA) is a liquidity measure. Equity ratios like E/TL and E/TA are key for solvency because they show how much equity is available compared to debt or liabilities.

In solvency analysis, equity over total liabilities (E/TL) is crucial because it indicates the proportion of equity relative to liabilities. If equity is significantly higher than liabilities, the company is more solvent. Similarly, Equity/Total Assets (E/TA) shows the portion of assets financed by equity, so higher values mean less reliance on debt, which is good for solvency.

Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) might also be important because positive working capital indicates the company can meet short-term obligations, which is part of solvency. But maybe the key is the equity ratios here.

I think the first split should be on a key solvency ratio. Let me think: Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL). If this ratio is high, say above a certain threshold, the company is solvent. If it's low, maybe it's not. Alternatively, maybe Equity/Total Assets (E/TA) is better because it's a common solvency measure. The debt-to-equity ratio is often used, but here it's presented as E/TA, which is the inverse. Higher E/TA is better.

Alternatively, the Working Capital/Total Assets might be a starting point, but I think solvency is more about long-term, so equity ratios are better.

Wait, let me think step by step. Let's suppose the most important feature is Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL). Let's say if E/TL is greater than 0.5, meaning equity is more than half of total liabilities, then the company is solvent. If it's less, then maybe check another ratio.

Alternatively, maybe Equity/Total Assets (E/TA) is the first split. If E/TA is high, like above 0.6, that would mean 60% of the company's assets are financed by equity, so they're solvent. If it's lower, then check another ratio. 

Alternatively, maybe the Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) is first, but that's more of a liquidity measure. Solvency is about long-term, so maybe that's secondary.

Another thought: the Net Income/Sales (NI/Sales) or EBIT/Sales could be important. If they have positive earnings, that's good for solvency. But again, maybe the equity ratios are more direct.

I think the key is to start with the most critical solvency ratios. Let me try to structure it.

Perhaps the first split is on Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL). Let's say:

If E/TL > 0.3, then solvent. 

If E/TL <= 0.3, then check another ratio, maybe Equity/Total Assets (E/TA). 

Wait, but maybe the order is different. Alternatively, maybe the first split is on E/TA. Let's think of common ratios. The debt-to-assets ratio is (Total Liabilities)/Total Assets, so E/TA is 1 - (Total Liabilities)/Total Assets. So higher E/TA means lower debt, better solvency. 

Suppose the first split is on E/TA. Let's say if E/TA is above 0.5, solvent. If not, check another feature.

Alternatively, maybe Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) is first. If WC is positive, that's good, but maybe that's a liquidity measure. 

Alternatively, the Net Income/Total Capital (NI/TC) could indicate profitability, which affects solvency. If a company is making profit, they can pay debts.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky without data, but I have to make an educated guess. Let me try to proceed.

Starting with E/TL:

Suppose the first split is E/TL > threshold. Let's pick a threshold, say 0.2. If yes, then solvent. If not, proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on E/TA. Let's say if E/TA > 0.4, solvent.

Alternatively, maybe the Working Capital/TA is first. Let's say if WC/TA > 0.1 (meaning working capital is 10% of assets), then solvent, else check another.

Alternatively, let's think of the most critical ratios for solvency. The equity ratios (E/TL and E/TA) are primary. 

Suppose first split is E/TL:

- If E/TL > 0.3 → solvent
- Else, check E/TA:
   - If E/TA > 0.3 → solvent
   - Else, check another feature like WC/TA or EBIT/Sales.

Alternatively, after E/TL and E/TA, maybe check Working Capital/TA.

Alternatively, maybe after the first split on E/TL, if it's below, then look at EBIT/Sales. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on E/TA.

Let me try to structure a possible decision tree step by step.

First, I'll assume the first split is on Equity/Total Assets (E/TA). Let's pick a threshold. Suppose if E/TA >= 0.4, then the company is solvent. Because if equity is 40% of total assets, that's decent. If below, then check another feature.

Suppose the next split is on Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL). If E/TL >= 0.2, then solvent, else not.

Alternatively, after E/TA, maybe check Net Income/Sales (NI/Sales). If the company is profitable (NI/Sales positive), that's better.

Alternatively, let's think of the tree:

Root node: E/TA (Equity/Total Assets)

- If E/TA >= 0.4 → Solvent (class: solvent)
- Else, proceed to next node.

Next node (when E/TA <0.4): Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL)

- If E/TL >= 0.2 → Check another feature, like Working Capital/TA (WC/TA)
   - If WC/TA >= 0.1 → Solvent
   - Else → Not solvent
- Else (E/TL <0.2), proceed further?

Alternatively, maybe after E/TL split, if E/TL <0.2, then check WC/TA.

Alternatively, perhaps:

Root node: E/TA

- If E/TA >= 0.4 → solvent
- Else:
   - Split on E/TL
      - If E/TL >=0.2 → solvent
      - Else:
          - Split on WC/TA
             - If WC/TA >=0.1 → solvent?
             - Else not solvent.

Alternatively, maybe after E/TA and E/TL, the final decision might be based on profitability like EBIT/Sales.

Alternatively, maybe after E/TA and E/TL, the next is Working Capital/TA.

Alternatively, maybe the second split after E/TA is on Working Capital/TA.

Wait, maybe the first split is on E/TL, then E/TA, then WC/TA.

Alternatively, let me think of possible splits.

Another approach: Let's think of the most critical factors first. The equity ratios (E/TL and E/TA) are primary. Let's start with E/TL.

Suppose first split:

- If E/TL > 0.2 → solvent
- Else:
   - Split on E/TA
      - If E/TA > 0.3 → solvent
      - Else:
          - Check WC/TA
             - If WC/TA >0.1 → solvent
             - Else → not solvent.

Alternatively, maybe after E/TL and E/TA, the next is WC/TA.

Alternatively, maybe after E/TL, instead of E/TA, check EBIT/Sales.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Working Capital/TA, then E/TL, then E/TA.

Hmm, not sure, but I need to make a decision.

Alternatively, think of the following:

The most important feature is E/TL (Equity over Total Liabilities). If that ratio is above a certain threshold, say 0.3 (equity is 30% of liabilities), then solvent. If not, check another ratio.

Suppose the next split after E/TL is on E/TA. If E/TA is above 0.4, then solvent, else not.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is E/TA (equity over total assets). For example, if equity is 40% of total assets, that's good. If not, check E/TL.

Alternatively, let me think of possible thresholds. Let's assume:

First split on E/TL (Equity/Total Liabilities):

- If E/TL > 0.5 → solvent. A high equity relative to liabilities means solvent.

- Else:

   - Split on E/TA (Equity/Total Assets):

      - If E/TA > 0.3 → solvent (since even if equity isn't very high compared to liabilities, overall equity is a decent portion of assets)

      - Else:

          - Split on WC/TA (Working Capital/Total Assets):

              - If WC/TA > 0.2 → solvent (positive working capital helps)

              - Else → not solvent.

Alternatively, maybe WC/TA is less critical than other factors.

Alternatively, after E/TA, instead of WC/TA, check Net Income/Sales (NI/Sales):

- If NI/Sales > 0 → solvent (profitable)

- Else → not.

But maybe that's too simplistic.

Alternatively, the tree could be structured as:

Root: E/TL (Equity/Total Liabilities)

- > 0.4 → solvent

Else,

- Split on E/TA (Equity/Total Assets)

   - >0.3 → solvent

   Else,

      - Split on WC/TA (Working Capital/Total Assets)

          - >0.1 → solvent

          Else,

              Split on Net Income/Sales (NI/Sales) ?

              - >0 → solvent

              Else → not.

Alternatively, maybe the final split is on EBIT/Sales.

Alternatively, perhaps after E/TL and E/TA, the next is NI/Sales.

Alternatively, let me think again. Since I have to choose among the features, and the user provided all the features, so I need to use some of them.

Alternatively, maybe the key splits are on E/TL, then WC/TA, then E/TA.

Alternatively, let me try to make a possible tree structure with the given features.

Perhaps the first split is on E/TL (Equity/Total Liabilities):

If E/TL > 0.3 → solvent

Else,

Split on WC/TA (Working Capital/Total Assets):

   If WC/TA > 0.1 → solvent

   Else,

      Split on E/TA (Equity/Total Assets):

         If E/TA > 0.2 → solvent

         Else → not solvent

Alternatively, that could be a structure.

Alternatively, maybe after E/TL and WC/TA, check EBIT/Sales.

Alternatively, let's try another approach. Since solvency is about ability to meet long-term obligations, the equity ratios (E/TL and E/TA) are key. Let's start with E/TL.

Suppose:

Root: E/TL > 0.2 → solvent

Else,

Split on E/TA > 0.3 → solvent

Else,

Split on WC/TA > 0.1 → solvent

Else → not solvent

Alternatively, that's a three-level tree.

Alternatively, the tree might have more splits.

Alternatively, let's think of possible thresholds. Let me assume some thresholds that are logical.

Suppose the first split is on E/TL (Equity over Total Liabilities). Let's say if this ratio is greater than 0.3 (equity is 30% of total liabilities), then the company is solvent. 

If not, then split on E/TA (Equity over Total Assets). Suppose if E/TA is above 0.4 (equity is 40% of total assets), then solvent. 

If both are below, then check Working Capital/TA. If WC/TA is above 0.2, maybe solvent, else not.

Alternatively, let me structure this:

|--- Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL) > 0.3  
||--- Class: Solvent  
|--- Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL) <= 0.3  
||--- Equity/Total Assets (E/TA) > 0.4  
|||--- Class: Solvent  
||--- Equity/Total Assets (E/TA) <= 0.4  
||||--- Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) > 0.2  
|||||--- Class: Solvent  
||||--- Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) <= 0.2  
||||||--- Class: Not Solvent  

This way, the tree uses the three most critical features in order. But I need to ensure that all features are considered, but not necessarily all used. The user didn't specify to use all features, just the most important. 

Alternatively, maybe after E/TL and E/TA, instead of WC/TA, check another feature like Net Income/Sales.

Alternatively, another structure could be:

Root: Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL)

- If E/TL > 0.2 → Solvent

- Else:

   - Split on Working Capital/TA > 0.1

      - If yes → Solvent

      - Else:

          - Split on Equity/TA >0.3 → Solvent

          - Else → Not solvent

This way, if equity over liabilities is low, but they have some working capital and decent equity over assets, they might still be solvent.

Alternatively, the tree could have more splits. Since the user provided 8 features but the example used only petal width and petal length, perhaps the decision tree will use a few key features.

Another possibility is starting with E/TA:

Root: E/TA > 0.4 → Solvent

Else,

   Split on E/TL > 0.2 → Solvent

   Else,

      Split on WC/TA > 0.1 → Solvent

      Else → Not solvent

This also uses three features.

Alternatively, maybe include a profitability measure like EBIT/Sales.

Suppose after E/TL and E/TA, check EBIT/Sales:

Root: E/TL > 0.3 → solvent

Else,

   Split on E/TA >0.4 → solvent

   Else,

      Split on EBIT/Sales > 0.1 → solvent

      Else → Not solvent

This way, if a company has low equity ratios but still has decent EBIT relative to sales, it might still be solvent.

Hmm, this is challenging without data. But since the user wants the most important features, I think the primary features are E/TL and E/TA. Then WC/TA could be secondary, followed by profitability ratios.

Let me try to settle on a structure. Let's consider that the most critical split is E/TL first. If that's good, solvent. If not, check E/TA. If that's also bad, then check WC/TA. If WC/TA is good, maybe solvent, else not. Alternatively, after E/TL and E/TA, maybe a profitability ratio like EBIT/Sales is the next.

Alternatively, maybe the tree is:

|--- Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL) > 0.3  
||--- class: Solvent  
|--- Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL) <= 0.3  
||--- Equity/Total Assets (E/TA) > 0.4  
|||--- class: Solvent  
||--- Equity/Total Assets (E/TA) <= 0.4  
||||--- Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) > 0.2  
|||||--- class: Solvent  
||||--- Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) <= 0.2  
||||||--- class: Not Solvent  

This uses three features. Alternatively, maybe WC/TA is replaced by another feature like EBIT/Sales.

Alternatively, let's think of the example given. In the iris example, they used petal width, then within that, maybe another petal feature. So perhaps in our case, after E/TL, the next split is on another equity ratio like E/TA, then a liquidity ratio like WC/TA.

Alternatively, let's consider another approach. The most important features might be E/TL and E/TA, then WC/TA, and perhaps Net Income/Sales. 

Alternatively, let me think of possible thresholds. Let me pick some plausible numbers.

First split on E/TL > 0.25 (equity is 25% of liabilities). If yes, solvent. Else,

Second split on E/TA > 0.3 (equity is 30% of assets). If yes, solvent. Else,

Third split on WC/TA > 0.1 (working capital is 10% of assets). If yes, solvent. Else,

Not solvent.

This uses three features. Alternatively, maybe E/TL is more important than E/TA. 

Alternatively, another structure could be:

Root: Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL) > 0.3 → Solvent

Else,

Split on Working Capital/TA > 0.1 → Solvent

Else,

Split on Equity/TA >0.4 → Solvent

Else → Not solvent.

This way, if E/TL is low but WC is good, they might still be solvent, or if E/TA is decent even if WC is low.

Hmm, but which order is better?

Alternatively, since E/TL directly relates to equity covering liabilities, that's the first check. If that's good, solvent. If not, then check if they have equity over assets (E/TA) as a backup measure. If that's also low, then check WC/TA for liquidity.

Alternatively, let's go with the first structure I thought of:

|--- Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL) > 0.3 → Solvent  
|--- Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL) <= 0.3  
||--- Equity/Total Assets (E/TA) > 0.4 → Solvent  
||--- Equity/Total Assets (E/TA) <= 0.4  
||||--- Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) > 0.2 → Solvent  
||||--- Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) <= 0.2 → Not Solvent  

This uses three key features and seems logical. Let me check if all features are considered but not forced into the tree. Since the user wants the most important, this should be okay.

Alternatively, maybe another feature like Net Income/Sales is better than WC/TA. Suppose after E/TL and E/TA, check if they are profitable (Net Income/Sales >0).

So:

|--- E/TL >0.3 → Solvent  
|--- E/TL <=0.3  
||--- E/TA >0.4 → Solvent  
||--- E/TA <=0.4  
||||--- Net Income/Sales >0 → Solvent  
||||--- Net Income/Sales <=0 → Not solvent  

This could be another structure. Profitability might be important. 

Alternatively, combining both WC/TA and Net Income/Sales:

|--- E/TL >0.3 → Solvent  
|--- E/TL <=0.3  
||--- E/TA >0.4 → Solvent  
||--- E/TA <=0.4  
||||--- WC/TA >0.1 → Solvent  
||||--- WC/TA <=0.1  
||||||--- Net Income/Sales >0 → Solvent  
||||||--- Else → Not solvent  

This is getting more complex, but maybe more accurate. However, the example given by the user only went three levels deep. Let's keep it simple.

Perhaps the first structure with three features is sufficient. Let me go with that.



#########################


<think>
Okay, I need to create a Python function that mimics a decision tree for predicting whether a company is solvent based on the given features. The user provided the structure of the example function, so I should follow that format closely. 

First, let me recall the features and their keys. The features are all ratios like EBIT/TA, NI/TC, Sales/TA, etc. The target is 'target' where 1 is solvent and 0 is insolvent. 

The example function uses a list called nodes, which tracks whether each inner node's condition was met. The length of nodes depends on the number of inner nodes. Since I don't have the actual decision tree structure provided here, maybe I need to assume a plausible structure based on common features or perhaps the user expects me to create a sample decision tree? Wait, the user mentioned "format this decision tree as a Python function" but didn't provide the tree structure. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the user says "now format this decision tree as a Python function..." but I don't see the tree description. Oh, perhaps the user forgot to include the actual decision tree structure here. That's a problem. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to a decision tree that I should build based on the features provided? Or maybe they expect me to make an example similar to the one given in the example, but using the given features. Since the example function was for a diabetes prediction with different features, maybe I should simulate a decision tree structure using the company solvency features. 

Alternatively, perhaps there was an initial decision tree described in the user's message that I missed. Let me check again. The user's first message starts with "Now, format this decision tree as a Python function..." but the rest includes the feature keys, target variable description, and an example function. There's no explicit decision tree structure given. Oh, this is confusing. Maybe the user intended to include a decision tree structure but it's missing? 

Hmm, perhaps the user expects me to create a sample decision tree structure using the features provided, then code that into a function. Since the problem is about formatting an existing decision tree into code, but the tree isn't provided, perhaps I need to make a plausible one. Let me think of common splits for company solvency. 

Common financial ratios for solvency include Equity/TA (high means more solvent), EBIT/Sales (profitability), NI/Sales (net profit margin), etc. Maybe the decision tree could split on Equity/TA first. Suppose the first split is Equity/TA > 0.5? Then, if yes, maybe check another ratio like EBIT/Sales. Let me try to construct a simple tree. 

Let me outline a possible decision tree structure. Let's say the first node checks if Equity/TA is greater than 0.3. If yes, maybe it goes to another node checking EBIT/Sales > 0.1. If that's true, predict solvent (1). If not, maybe check NI/TC. Alternatively, maybe another path. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Sales/TA. High Sales/TA (like > 2) might indicate better asset utilization and solvency. Then, if Sales/TA is high, check another ratio. 

Alternatively, here's a possible structure:

Root node: EBIT/Sales > 0.05
- If yes: go to node 2 (check another condition)
- If no: go to node 3

Node 2: NI/Sales > 0.03
- If yes: predict solvent (1)
- If no: check Equity/TA > 0.4

Node 3: WC/TA < 0.5
- If yes: go to node 4 (maybe Equity/TL > 0.6)
- If no: predict insolvent (0)

This is a hypothetical tree. The nodes would have conditions based on these thresholds. Then the code would translate these conditions into the nodes list and the nested if statements. 

Alternatively, maybe a simpler tree with 3 nodes. Let me think of another approach. 

Wait, the example function had 5 nodes (nodes = 5 * [None]). The user's example used 5 nodes. But the actual number depends on the tree depth. Let me try to create a tree with a few splits. 

Suppose the decision tree looks like this:

1. First split on Equity/TA > 0.4
   - If true: check Sales/TA > 2.0
       - If true: predict 1 (solvent)
       - Else: check NI/Sales > 0.05
           - If true: predict 1, else 0
   - If false: check WC/TA < 0.3
       - If true: check EBIT/Sales > 0.08
           - If true: predict 0, else predict 1? Not sure. Maybe better to have a path leading to 0.

Alternatively, maybe:

Root node: EBIT/Sales > 0.05?
- If yes: check Equity/TA > 0.3
   - If yes: predict 1
   - Else: check NI/Sales > 0.02
      - If yes: 1 else 0
- If no (EBIT/Sales <=0.05): check WC/TA <0.5
   - If yes: check Sales/TA >1.5 → predict 0 or 1?
   - Else: predict 0

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to sketch a tree with nodes and conditions. Let's say the tree has 4 inner nodes. The nodes list would be of length 4, each representing a condition. The prediction is built through nested if-else.

Alternatively, since the example had 5 nodes, maybe I need to make a tree with 5 nodes. Let's try:

Nodes:

0: EBIT/Sales > 0.05 → if yes, go to node1, else node2
1: Equity/TA > 0.4 → yes → predict 1; else → node3
2: WC/TA < 0.5 → yes → node4, else predict 0
3: NI/Sales > 0.02 → predict 1 else 0
4: Sales/TA > 2.0 → yes predict 1, else 0

Wait, this way nodes[0] to nodes[4], so 5 nodes. Then the code would look like:

nodes[0] = X["EBIT/Sales"] > 0.05
nodes[1] = X["Equity/TA"] > 0.4
nodes[2] = X["WC/TA"] < 0.5
nodes[3] = X["NI/Sales"] > 0.02
nodes[4] = X["Sales/TA"] > 2.0

Then the logic:

if nodes[0]:
    if nodes[1]:
        prediction =1
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction=1
        else:
            prediction=0
else:
    if nodes[2]:
        if nodes[4]:
            prediction=1
        else:
            prediction=0
    else:
        prediction=0

Wait, but I need to structure this into the nested if-else correctly. Maybe the first condition is node0:

if nodes[0] (EBIT/Sales >0.05):
    then check node1 (Equity/TA >0.4)
        if yes → predict 1
        else → check node3 (NI/Sales >0.02 → if yes predict 1 else 0)
else (node0 is false):
    check node2 (WC/TA <0.5)
        if yes → check node4 (Sales/TA>2 → predict1 else 0)
        else → predict 0

So the code would be:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/Sales"] > 0.05
    nodes[1] = X["Equity/TA"] > 0.4
    nodes[2] = X["WC/TA"] < 0.5
    nodes[3] = X["NI/Sales"] > 0.02
    nodes[4] = X["Sales/TA"] > 2.0

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction =1
            else:
                prediction =0
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction =1
            else:
                prediction =0
        else:
            prediction =0
    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but in this case, the nodes are set as per the conditions, and the prediction is built through the if-else. 

Alternatively, maybe the nodes list is supposed to track all the nodes in the tree. Each node in the tree (whether inner or leaf) is a condition? Or only the inner nodes?

Wait the problem says: "a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes". So only inner nodes (the decision nodes, not the leaves). So in the example, the nodes list had 5 entries, which I assume correspond to all the inner nodes (each split). The leaves are the final decisions. 

In the example, the function had 5 nodes, and the code had 5 conditions. So maybe the number of nodes is equal to the number of splits in the tree. 

So for my example, if the tree has 5 inner nodes, then the list has 5 entries. 

But how to decide the exact structure? Since the user didn't provide the tree, I have to make one up. 

Alternatively, maybe I can choose a simple tree with two splits. For example:

Root node: Equity/TA > 0.3 → if yes, then solvent (1), else check EBIT/Sales > 0.05 → if yes predict 1 else 0. So that would be two inner nodes. 

But then the nodes list would have two entries. But the example had 5 nodes, so perhaps the user expects a more complex tree. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user expects me to use the features provided and make a plausible decision tree with some splits. 

Alternatively, maybe I can base it on common financial ratios. For instance:

The first split might be on the Equity/TA ratio (a common solvency measure). Suppose the threshold is 0.4. If Equity/TA >0.4 → solvent (1), else check another ratio like EBIT/Sales. 

Suppose the next split is on EBIT/Sales >0.05. If yes → solvent, else check WC/TA <0.3. If WC/TA is low (good working capital), then solvent, else not. 

Wait, but this would be a tree with three nodes (two splits and one more). Let me structure it:

Nodes:

0: Equity/TA >0.4 → yes → predict 1; no → go to node1
1: EBIT/Sales >0.05 → yes → predict1; no → go to node2
2: WC/TA <0.3 → yes → predict1 else 0

So nodes list has 3 entries. The nodes would be nodes[0], nodes[1], nodes[2]. The code would be:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TA"] > 0.4
    nodes[1] = X["EBIT/Sales"] > 0.05
    nodes[2] = X["WC/TA"] < 0.3

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =1
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction =1
            else:
                prediction =0
    return prediction, nodes

But the example had a 5-node structure. Maybe I need to make a more complex tree. 

Alternatively, considering the features, let's think of another approach. Let's make a tree with 5 inner nodes. 

Suppose:

Node 0: EBIT/Sales > 0.04 → if yes → node1; else → node2
Node1: Equity/TA >0.3 → yes → node3; else → node4
Node3: NI/Sales >0.02 → yes → predict1; else → node5
Wait, getting confused. Let me try to structure it as:

The first condition:

nodes[0] = EBIT/Sales > 0.04 → yes → node1, no → node2
nodes[1] = Equity/TA >0.4 → yes → node3, no → predict0
nodes[2] = WC/TA <0.5 → yes → node4, else → predict0
nodes[3] = NI/Sales >0.02 → yes → predict1 else → node5
nodes[4] = Sales/TA >1.5 → yes → predict1 else → node6 (but maybe not needed)

This might get too complex. Alternatively, perhaps the example in the user's question is better followed. Let me see the example again:

The example function had nodes[0] to nodes[4], each being a condition. The code uses if-else to navigate through them. 

Maybe I can create a similar structure. Let's try:

The nodes are:

0: EBIT/Sales > 0.05 → if yes → node1, else → node2
1: Equity/TA >0.3 → yes → predict1, else → node3
2: WC/TA <0.4 → yes → node4, else → predict0
3: NI/Sales >0.01 → yes → predict1, else → node4
4: Sales/TA > 2 → yes → predict1 else → 0

Wait, but need to structure the logic. 

Alternatively, here's a possible structure with 5 nodes:

nodes[0]: EBIT/Sales >0.05 → yes → node1; no → node2
nodes[1]: Equity/TA >0.4 → yes → predict1; else → node3
nodes[2]: WC/TA <0.3 → yes → node4; else → node5
nodes[3]: NI/Sales >0.02 → yes → predict1; else → node5
nodes[4]: Sales/TA >1.8 → yes → predict1; else → predict0

nodes[5]: ... but maybe nodes only up to 4. 

Wait, maybe the code would look like this:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/Sales"] > 0.05
    nodes[1] = X["Equity/TA"] > 0.4
    nodes[2] = X["WC/TA"] < 0.3
    nodes[3] = X["NI/Sales"] > 0.02
    nodes[4] = X["Sales/TA"] > 1.8

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =1
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction =1
            else:
                prediction =0
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction =1
            else:
                prediction =0
        else:
            prediction =0
    return prediction, nodes

This uses all 5 nodes. 

But I'm not sure if this is the best approach. Since the user's question requires a plausible answer, perhaps this is acceptable. The key is to generate a function that uses the features, sets the nodes as conditions, and uses them in nested ifs. 

Alternatively, another approach: Let me look at the features and choose thresholds that make sense.

Equity/TA is a common ratio; higher is better for solvency. Let's set a threshold of 0.3 (30%).

EBIT/Sales is a profitability ratio (like operating margin). A higher value is better. Maybe 0.05 (5%).

WC/TA (Working Capital to Total Assets) being positive is good, but maybe a threshold of 0.2 (WC is 20% of assets).

NI/Sales is Net Income to Sales (Net Profit Margin). A threshold like 0.03 (3%).

Sales/TA is Sales to Total Assets (Asset Turnover). A higher ratio is better. Maybe threshold of 1.5 (Sales 1.5x Assets).

So, with these thresholds, a possible tree could be:

Node0: Equity/TA >0.3 → if yes → node1; else → node2
Node1: EBIT/Sales >0.05 → yes → predict1; else → node3
Node2: WC/TA >0.2 → yes → node4; else → node5
Node3: NI/Sales >0.03 → yes → predict1; else → 0
Node4: Sales/TA >1.5 → yes → predict1 else →0
Node5: ... but this may exceed nodes.

Alternatively, with 5 nodes:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TA"] > 0.3
    nodes[1] = X["EBIT/Sales"] > 0.05
    nodes[2] = X["WC/TA"] > 0.2
    nodes[3] = X["NI/Sales"] > 0.03
    nodes[4] = X["Sales/TA"] > 1.5

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =1
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction =1
            else:
                prediction =0
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction =1
            else:
                prediction =0
        else:
            prediction =0
    return prediction, nodes

This structure uses all 5 nodes and has a plausible logic. 

Alternatively, perhaps another arrangement. 

But in any case, since the user's question requires an answer, I'll proceed with one of these structures. Let's pick the first example I had with 5 nodes:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/Sales"] > 0.05
    nodes[1] = X["Equity/TA"] > 0.4
    nodes[2] = X["WC/TA"] < 0.5
    nodes[3] = X["NI/Sales"] > 0.02
    nodes[4] = X["Sales/TA"] > 2.0

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction =1
            else:
                prediction =0
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction =1
            else:
                prediction =0
        else:
            prediction =0
    return prediction, nodes

This uses all 5 nodes and the logic navigates through them. The thresholds are chosen arbitrarily but make some financial sense (e.g., Equity/TA over 0.4 is a strong indicator, EBIT/Sales over 5% is decent, WC/TA below 0.5 might be acceptable, etc.)

Alternatively, maybe the user expects the first node to be the most important feature, like Equity/TA, but I think this is sufficient.
