<think>

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to create a decision tree classifier for company solvency using the provided financial ratios, with a maximum depth of 2. First, I need to recall how decision trees work. The idea is to split the data based on the feature that provides the most information gain or the best split, which in this context would be the feature that best separates solvent from non-solvent companies.

The features given are:
1. Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets (EBIT/TA)
2. Net Income/Total Capital (NI/TC)
3. Sales/Total Assets (S/TA)
4. Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Sales (EBIT/S)
5. Net Income/Sales (NI/S)
6. Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA)
7. Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL)
8. Equity/Total Assets (E/TA)

The decision tree needs to have a maximum depth of 2, so the root node will split on the most important feature, and each of its branches will split again on the next most important features, but not deeper than that.

First, I need to figure out which features are most important for classifying solvency. Since I don't have actual data, I have to rely on domain knowledge. Solvency is about a company's ability to meet its long-term obligations. Key indicators include liquidity ratios (like Working Capital), debt ratios (like Equity/Total Liabilities), and profitability ratios (like EBIT/TA, NI/TC). 

Looking at the features provided:
- Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA): High working capital indicates better liquidity, which is important for solvency.
- Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL): Higher equity relative to liabilities suggests lower risk of insolvency.
- Equity/Total Assets (E/TA): Also a debt ratio; higher equity means less reliance on debt.
- EBIT/TA and NI/TC: These measure profitability relative to assets and capital, so higher values are better for solvency.

Possibly, the most critical feature would be something like EBIT/TA because profitability is fundamental. But maybe Working Capital/Total Assets is more directly related to solvency. Alternatively, Equity/Total Liabilities could be key because it shows the proportion of equity versus liabilities.

Wait, but in the example given, the decision tree used petal width first, which in the iris dataset is a key differentiator between classes. So perhaps the first split should be on the feature with the highest Gini importance or information gain.

Since I can't compute actual metrics, I need to make an educated guess. Let's think step by step.

First, which feature best separates solvent companies from non-solvent? High Working Capital (WC) would mean the company can meet short-term obligations, so WC/TA might be a good first split. Alternatively, a high Equity/Total Assets (E/TA) means less debt, which is better for solvency.

Alternatively, maybe Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL) is better. If a company has high equity compared to its liabilities, it's less likely to default. For instance, if E/TL is high (say >1), that means equity is more than liabilities, which is a good sign. If it's low (like <0.5), that might indicate insolvency risk.

Another angle: let's consider standard solvency ratios. The Debt-to-Equity ratio is common, but here the features include Equity/Total Liabilities, which is the inverse. So a higher E/TL would be better. Maybe the first split is on E/TL. Let's say if E/TL is above a threshold, the company is solvent, otherwise, it's not. But since we need a depth of 2, the root node can split on E/TL, and then each branch can split on another feature.

Alternatively, maybe Working Capital/TA is better as the first split. Companies with higher WC/TA can pay off short-term debts, which is crucial for solvency. Suppose the first split is WC/TA <= threshold, then if below that threshold, they might be more likely non-solvency, and if above, maybe check another ratio like EBIT/TA.

Alternatively, maybe EBIT/Sales (EBIT/S) is important, since higher EBIT margin indicates better profitability. Companies with higher EBIT/S can cover their expenses and interest, so that might be a good split.

Hmm, this is tricky without data. Let me try to think of typical splits. In financial analysis, the Quick Ratio or Current Ratio (liquidity) and Debt to Equity are common. Since WC/TA is working capital over total assets, which is similar to a liquidity ratio. 

Alternatively, the Equity/Total Assets ratio (E/TA) is a measure of leverage. A higher E/TA means more equity financing, less debt, so better solvency. Maybe splitting on E/TA first.

Wait, the example given used petal width, which in the iris dataset separates setosa from others. So maybe the first split should be on a feature that has a clear threshold separating two classes. Let's assume that one of these features has a similar clear split.

Suppose the first split is on Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL). Let's say if E/TL is greater than 0.5, the company is solvent, but if not, need another split. Alternatively, if the first split is on Working Capital/TA (WC/TA), maybe above 0.2 is solvent, below might go to another split.

Alternatively, let's think of the features again. The user wants a max depth of 2, so the tree will have the root, then two branches, each with another split. So total of 3 levels (root, two children, then each child splits once more).

Wait, maximum depth of 2 would allow the root (depth 1) to have children (depth 2). So each leaf node is at depth 2. So the structure would be:

Root (feature 1 split)
├── Left child (split on feature 2)
│   └── Leaf (class)
└── Right child (split on feature 3)
    └── Leaf (class)

Wait no, maximum depth of 2 means the deepest leaves are at depth 2. So the root is depth 1, splits into depth 2 leaves, but if you split again, that would be depth 3. Wait, maybe I'm confused.

Wait, in decision trees, depth is the number of splits from root to leaf. So maximum depth of 2 means that the tree can have up to two splits. So starting at root (depth 0?), then first split at depth 1, then second split at depth 2. So the tree can have leaves at depth 2.

Wait, terminology: sometimes depth is counted as the number of layers. Root is depth 1, then children are depth 2. So maximum depth 2 would mean the root has children (leaves), so no further splits. Wait, maybe the user wants depth 2 as the maximum, meaning two layers of splits. Let me check the example given:

In the example, the decision tree has three levels. The root is depth 1, then two children (depth 2), then each of those splits again into depth 3. Wait no, in the example:

The example decision tree for iris:

|--- petal width (cm) <= 0.80 (root)
||--- class: setosa (leaf)
|--- petal width (cm) > 0.80 (root's right branch)
||--- petal width (cm) <= 1.75 (second split)
|||--- class: versicolor (depth 3?)
||--- petal width (cm) > 1.75 (depth 2's right)
|||--- class: virginica (depth 3?)

Wait, actually, in the example given by the user, the tree has a maximum depth of 3? But the user in their own example says "maximum depth of 2" but in their example, the depth is 3. Hmm. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake, but in their example, the tree has two splits for the right branch. The left branch is a leaf at depth 2, and the right branch splits again, making depth 3.

Wait, perhaps the user's example actually has a max depth of 3, but they said 2. Maybe there's confusion. Alternatively, perhaps they count depth starting from 0. Let me check the user's example again:

In their example, the decision tree for iris has:

Root: petal width <=0.8 (depth 1)
then left is a leaf (depth 2)
right branch splits again on petal width <=1.75 (depth 2), leading to leaves at depth 3.

Hmm, so perhaps the user's example has a depth of 3 but they mentioned a max depth of 2. That might be an error. But the user's instruction says "maximum depth of 2" for the new tree. So in our case, we need to ensure that the tree doesn't go beyond depth 2. So each leaf must be at depth 2. So the root is depth 1, splits into two nodes (depth 2), which are leaves. Wait, but then it can't have further splits. Alternatively, perhaps they allow one split (depth 1 root, split into two children at depth 2, which are leaves). That would be maximum depth 2. Alternatively, perhaps the root is depth 0, so depth 2 allows two splits. This is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, let me read the user's instruction again: "build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 using the most important features. The tree should classify whether a company is solvent or not."

The example they gave has a maximum depth of 3 (since the right branch splits twice), but they said maximum depth of 2. Maybe they consider the depth as the number of splits. So if the example has two splits (from root to first split, then another split on the right branch), that's two splits, hence depth 2. So maybe the depth is the number of splits from root to leaf. Therefore, for the problem here, maximum depth 2 would allow two splits, so the tree can have up to three levels (root, two splits, leaves at third level). Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think of the example again.

In their example:

First split on petal width <=0.8: this is the first split (depth 1).

The left branch is a leaf (so that path has depth 1? or 2?).

The right branch splits again on petal width <=1.75: that's a second split (depth 2), leading to leaves at depth 2+1=3? Hmm, perhaps it's better to proceed with the user's example as guidance.

In their example, the tree has a root node (depth 1), the left is a leaf (depth 2?), and the right has another split (depth 2) leading to leaves at depth 3. So maybe the user counts depth as the number of nodes along the path, starting at root as depth 1. Thus, a maximum depth of 2 would allow the tree to have leaves at depth 2, so only one split. Wait but in their example, they have two splits on the right branch. So perhaps the user made a mistake, but regardless, following the instruction, for the new problem, need max depth 2. So the tree can have at most two layers of splits. So root (split 1), then each of those can split again (split 2), leading to leaves. So maximum depth 2 would mean two splits, with leaves at depth 3 (if counting root as 1). But perhaps the user wants leaves at depth 2, meaning only one split from the root. 

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum depth refers to the number of edges from root to leaf. So depth 2 would mean two edges, so two splits. That would align with the example they gave. In their example, the rightmost path has two edges (root to first split, then to second split), so depth 2. The left path has one edge (depth 1). But the user said maximum depth of 2 for their example. So to comply with their instruction, for the new tree, we need to have a tree where the maximum path length (number of edges) is 2. Hence, two splits maximum.

Therefore, the structure would be:

Root splits on feature A. Each of those splits can split again on feature B or C, but the leaves are at depth 2.

So for the new problem:

We need to choose the first split (most important feature), then each child can split again on another feature (second most important for each branch). 

Given that, I need to select the two most important features. The first split will be on the most important, then each child splits on the next important features.

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on a different feature for each branch.

But since I don't have data, I need to make assumptions based on financial knowledge.

Let me list possible features in order of importance for solvency:

1. Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL): High equity relative to liabilities indicates better solvency. A threshold here could separate solvent companies.

2. Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA): Sufficient working capital shows ability to meet short-term obligations.

3. EBIT/Total Assets (EBIT/TA): Profitability relative to assets. Higher is better.

4. Equity/Total Assets (E/TA): Leverage ratio; higher is better.

5. Net Income/Total Capital (NI/TC): Profitability relative to capital.

6. Sales/Total Assets (S/TA): Asset efficiency, but maybe less directly related to solvency.

7. EBIT/Sales (EBIT/S): Profit margin, important but maybe less critical than others.

8. Net Income/Sales (NI/S): Similar to EBIT/S but after taxes and interest.

Assuming the first split is on E/TL. Let's say the threshold is 0.5. Companies with E/TL > 0.5 are solvent, but if not, need further split.

Alternatively, maybe WC/TA is first. Suppose threshold at 0.2. If WC/TA > 0.2, solvent, else check another ratio.

Alternatively, starting with EBIT/TA. Suppose the threshold is 0.1 (10% return on assets). Above is solvent, below needs another check.

Alternatively, E/TA. Suppose threshold 0.4, meaning equity is 40% of total assets. If above, solvent; else check another feature.

Hmm, let's pick the first split as E/TL (Equity/Total Liabilities). Suppose the first split is:

If E/TL > 0.5 → solvent (leaf)

Else, go to the next split.

The next split for the E/TL <=0.5 group might be on Working Capital/TA. Suppose threshold 0.15. If WC/TA >0.15 → solvent, else not.

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on EBIT/TA. Let's say if EBIT/TA >0.05 → solvent, else not.

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on NI/TC. 

Alternatively, the second split could be on E/TA again, but probably not.

Alternatively, let me think of standard ratios. The debt to equity ratio is Total Debt/Equity. Here, E/TL is Equity/Total Liabilities, which is the inverse. So E/TL = 1/(Debt/Equity). So higher E/TL is better.

Another approach: in the example, the first split was on petal width, which was the most discriminative. So perhaps the first split here should be the feature that gives the best separation between solvent and non-solvent. Let's assume E/TL is best first.

So first split: Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL) > 0.5 → solvent (left leaf)

Else, split on Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) > 0.2 → solvent (right-left leaf)

Else → non-solvent (right-right leaf)

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on EBIT/TA.

Alternatively, if the first split is WC/TA:

First split: WC/TA > 0.2 → solvent (left leaf)

Else, split on E/TL > 0.3 → solvent (right-left leaf) else non-solvent (right-right)

Alternatively, maybe the first split should be on E/TA (Equity/Total Assets). Suppose the threshold is 0.3. If E/TA >0.3 → solvent, else split on WC/TA.

Hmm, this is challenging without data, but I need to proceed.

Let me try to structure it step by step.

Step 1: Choose the most important feature for the first split. Let's say it's E/TL (Equity over Total Liabilities). Suppose the threshold is 0.5.

Root node: E/TL > 0.5 → solvent (left branch leaf)

Right branch (E/TL <=0.5) needs another split. The next important feature here could be Working Capital/TA (WC/TA). Let's say threshold 0.15.

So for the right branch:

If WC/TA >0.15 → solvent (second split left leaf)

Else → non-solvent (second split right leaf)

This would give a depth of 2 (since the second split is at depth 2, leading to leaves at depth 3? Wait, but the user's example had depth 2 as the maximum, but in that example, the leaves were at depth 3. Perhaps the user allows two splits, so depth 2 is acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on WC/TA, then split on E/TL.

Alternatively, let's see another approach. Let's think of possible thresholds:

Suppose the first split is on Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) >0.2 → solvent (left leaf)

Else, split on EBIT/Total Assets (EBIT/TA) >0.05 → solvent (right-left leaf)

Else → non-solvent (right-right leaf)

This also works.

Alternatively, first split on EBIT/TA >0.1 → solvent (left leaf)

Else split on WC/TA >0.15 → solvent (right-left)

Else non-solvent (right-right)

Alternatively, let me pick the first split as E/TL (Equity/Total Liabilities) >0.5 → solvent (left leaf). Then for the right branch (E/TL <=0.5), the next split is on EBIT/TA >0.05 → solvent (right-left leaf). Else non-solvent (right-right leaf). 

This might be a reasonable structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on E/TA (Equity/Total Assets). Suppose threshold 0.4 (meaning 40% equity in total assets). If above → solvent. Else, split on WC/TA.

Alternatively, let's think of what's more critical. If a company has high equity relative to liabilities, it's probably solvent. If not, even if equity is okay, but liabilities are too high, then need to look at other factors. 

Alternatively, another thought: maybe the most critical is working capital, because even a profitable company can fail if it can't pay short-term debts. So WC/TA first.

Suppose first split: WC/TA >0.2 → solvent (left leaf)

Else, split on E/TL >0.3 → solvent (right-left) else non-solvent (right-right)

Alternatively, WC/TA might be more immediate. So I'll go with that.

Alternatively, maybe the first split should be on E/TL because it's a direct measure of equity vs debt.

Alternatively, let's think of real-world ratios. The debt to equity ratio is a common solvency measure. Since E/TL is the inverse (Equity/(Debt + Equity)), but actually Total Liabilities include more than just debt. Hmm, perhaps Total Liabilities is Total Debt plus other liabilities. So E/TL is a measure of equity relative to all liabilities.

Alternatively, the equity ratio (E/TA) is another common measure.

Given the ambiguity, I think the first split is best as E/TL >0.5 → solvent, and then for the other branch, split on WC/TA.

Alternatively, I can present the following structure:

First split on Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL):

- If E/TL > 0.5 → solvent (leaf)

- Else → split on Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA):

   - If WC/TA > 0.15 → solvent (leaf)

   - Else → non-solvent (leaf)

This uses two splits, hence maximum depth 2.

Alternatively, the second split could be on EBIT/TA instead of WC/TA.

Alternatively, let's try to pick features that are more likely to be significant.

Another approach: in financial analysis, common solvency ratios include Debt to Equity (D/E), Debt to Assets (Total Debt/Total Assets), and Equity Multiplier. Also, current ratio (Current Assets/Current Liabilities) which is similar to WC/TA (WC = Current Assets - Current Liabilities; so WC/TA is (Current Assets - CL)/TA, but Current Ratio is CA/CL). 

Since we don't have Current Assets or Current Liabilities directly, but WC/TA is an aggregate measure of working capital relative to total assets. 

Given that, WC/TA could be a good second split.

Alternatively, let's also consider Net Income/Total Capital (NI/TC) as a profitability measure. If a company is profitable, it might be more solvent.

But without data, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, if the first split is on E/TL, then the second split could be on EBIT/TA to check profitability.

Alternatively, let's choose the following:

First split: Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL) >0.5 → solvent (left leaf)

Else:

   Split on EBIT/Total Assets (EBIT/TA) >0.05 → solvent (right-left leaf)

   Else → non-solvent (right-right leaf)

This might be better because even if equity is low, if the company has good profitability (EBIT/TA), it can service its debts.

Alternatively, combining both WC/TA and EBIT/TA.

But since it's maximum depth 2, we can only have two splits.

Alternatively, let's think of possible thresholds:

Suppose the first split is on Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) >0.2 → solvent (left)

Else, split on Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL) >0.3 → solvent (right-left) else non-solvent (right-right)

This way, if WC is insufficient, we check equity relative to liabilities.

Alternatively, I'll proceed with the first split as E/TL and second as WC/TA.

Alternatively, let me think of the following structure:

Root node split on Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL):

- If E/TL > 0.5 → solvent (left leaf)

- Else → split on Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA):

   - If WC/TA > 0.15 → solvent (right-left leaf)

   - Else → non-solvent (right-right leaf)

This structure uses two splits, hence depth 2.

Alternatively, to make it more balanced, maybe the first split is on E/TA (Equity/Total Assets):

- If E/TA > 0.4 → solvent (left leaf)

- Else → split on WC/TA >0.2 → solvent (right-left leaf) else non-solvent (right-right leaf)

This is also plausible.

Alternatively, the first split on WC/TA >0.2 → solvent (left leaf)

- Else, split on E/TL >0.3 → solvent (right-left leaf) else non-solvent (right-right leaf)

This might be better because even if equity isn't very high, sufficient working capital can indicate solvency.

Given the uncertainty, I think the most logical choice is to start with working capital because it's a liquidity measure critical for short-term obligations, then check equity if that's insufficient.

Therefore, I'll present the decision tree as:

1. First split on Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA):

   - If WC/TA > 0.2 → solvent (left leaf)

   - Else → split on Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL):

      - If E/TL > 0.3 → solvent (right-left leaf)

      - Else → non-solvent (right-right leaf)

Alternatively, perhaps the threshold for E/TL is higher, like 0.5.

Alternatively, maybe the first split on E/TL (Equity/Total Liabilities) >0.5, then split on WC/TA.

I think either approach is reasonable. Since the user's example started with a measure that could separate one class (petal width <=0.8 separated setosa), perhaps here starting with E/TL >0.5 could separate solvent companies with strong equity.

Alternatively, let's think of it this way: if a company has equity more than half of its total liabilities, that's a strong indicator of solvency. The remaining companies (with lower E/TL) might still be solvent if they have sufficient working capital.

So the tree would be:

Root: Equity/Total Liabilities > 0.5 → solvent (left leaf)

Else:

   Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.15 → solvent (right-left leaf)

   Else → non-solvent (right-right leaf)

This uses two splits, maximum depth 2.

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on EBIT/TA. 

Alternatively, let's go with this structure and present it as the answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
&\text{1. If Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL) > 0.5:} \\

<think>
Okay, I need to create a Python function that uses a decision tree to predict whether a company is solvent or not based on the given features. The function should return the prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, the features provided are all ratios like EBIT/TA, NI/TC, etc., and the target is 'target' which is 1 for solvent and 0 for insolvent. The user wants the decision tree formatted as a function similar to the example provided. The example uses a depth 2 tree with nodes and conditional checks.

The example function has nodes as a list where each entry is 1 or 0 based on if the condition is met. The nodes list is size 2, but since the depth is 2, maybe each level adds nodes. Wait, the example shows nodes[0] and nodes[1], which are two nodes. The structure is if the first node's condition is true, then check the second node's condition, leading to different predictions.

So for my problem, I need to structure a decision tree with similar conditions. The user didn't specify the exact tree structure, so maybe I have to assume a simple tree. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects me to create a hypothetical tree based on common financial ratios. Since there's no explicit tree provided, I need to make some assumptions here. Let me think of possible splits.

Common financial metrics for solvency include ratios like EBIT/TA, NI/TA, Equity/TA, etc. For example, a high EBIT/Sales ratio might indicate better profitability, contributing to solvency. Maybe the first split could be on EBIT/Sales. Let's say if EBIT/Sales is above a threshold, like 0.1 (10%), then proceed to another condition. Alternatively, maybe Equity/TA (equity over total assets) being above a certain threshold, like 0.3, indicating sufficient equity.

Wait, the example in the problem uses two nodes, so maybe the tree has depth 2. Let me think of a possible structure. Let's say the first node splits on EBIT/Sales <= 0.05. If yes, then check another condition, maybe NI/Sales. Suppose if that is also low, then the company is insolvent. Alternatively, maybe the second split is on WC/TA (working capital over total assets) being below 0.2, leading to a prediction.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Equity/TL (equity over total liabilities). Let me think of plausible thresholds. For instance:

Root node: EBIT/Sales <= 0.05 (if EBIT is less than 5% of sales, maybe the company is struggling). If true, then check another condition, maybe NI/Sales. If that's also negative or below a threshold like -0.1 (indicating net loss), then insolvent. Alternatively, if EBIT/Sales is above 0.05, then solvent.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Equity/TA. Let's think:

Suppose the first node is Equity/TA <= 0.4. If so, then maybe check another ratio like WC/TA. Suppose the second node is WC/TA <= 0.1, leading to insolvent.

Alternatively, I need to make sure the thresholds are meaningful. Let me think of possible thresholds for each ratio based on typical values.

Looking at the features:

EBIT/Sales: EBIT divided by sales. A positive value, maybe typical ranges. For example, a company with high profitability would have higher values. Suppose a threshold of 0.1 (10%) is a split point.

NI/Sales: Net income over sales. This can be negative if the company is losing money. Maybe a split at 0, so if NI/Sales < 0, then it's a problem.

Equity/TA: Equity over total assets. A higher ratio indicates more equity financing. Maybe a threshold of 0.3 (30% equity in assets) as a split.

WC/TA: Working capital over total assets. Working capital is current assets minus current liabilities. A negative WC might indicate liquidity issues. A threshold like 0.1 might be a split.

Let me try constructing a simple tree. Let's say the first split is on EBIT/Sales <= 0.1. If yes (condition met), then check another feature like NI/Sales <= -0.05 (net loss of 5%). If that's also true, then predict insolvent (0), else maybe check another condition. Wait, but in the example, the tree's structure is if the first node is true, then check the second node's condition, leading to different branches.

Alternatively, here's a possible structure:

- Root node (node 0): EBIT/Sales > 0.1 → solvent. Else, go to next node.

Wait, maybe better to structure as:

First node: EBIT/Sales <= 0.1 → condition is True (so node[0] is 1). If that's true, then check the second node, say NI/Sales <= -0.05. If both are true, prediction is 0 (insolvent). If first node is false (EBIT/Sales>0.1), predict solvent (1). But maybe the second node is another condition. Alternatively, maybe the second node is Equity/TA.

Alternatively, let me try to design a depth-2 tree with two nodes (so nodes list has two entries).

Suppose:

Node 0: EBIT/Sales <= 0.05 → if True (so node[0]=1), then go to node 1 (node 1's condition is, say, Equity/TA <= 0.3 → node[1]=1 if yes). If node 0 is True and node1 is True → predict 0. Else, maybe predict 1. Or perhaps the structure is:

If node0 (EBIT/Sales <=0.05) is True → check node1 (NI/Sales <=-0.1). If node1 is also True → predict 0, else maybe 1. But I need to map the structure to the example.

Alternatively, let's try to structure it like the example. The example has nodes[0] and nodes[1]. The first condition is HbA1c <=6.7 (nodes[0]), and nodes[1] is blood glucose. The logic is that if node0 is true (HbA1c low), then check node1's condition. If node0 is false (high HbA1c), then prediction is 1 regardless of node1.

In the example, the nodes are in order of the splits. So for my case, let's choose the first split as EBIT/Sales. Suppose:

nodes[0] = X["EBIT/Sales"] <= 0.05 → if this is true, then check node1's condition. Let’s choose the second condition as NI/Sales <= -0.05 (Net income is negative, 5% loss). So nodes[1] = X["NI/Sales"] <= -0.05.

Then the logic is:

if nodes[0] is true (EBIT/Sales <=0.05):

   then check nodes[1] (NI/Sales <=-0.05):

      if nodes[1] is true (yes, NI is negative enough), then prediction is 0 (insolvent)

      else (NI/Sales >-0.05 → maybe still a loss but not too bad?), prediction 1 (solvent?)

Wait, but maybe that's not the best. Alternatively, if EBIT is low and NI is also negative, that's worse. But maybe the prediction paths need to be determined.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

if nodes[0] (EBIT/Sales <=0.05):

   if nodes[1] (WC/TA <=0.1 → maybe working capital is low):

      predict 0 (insolvent)

   else (WC/TA>0.1 → better working capital → solvent?)

      predict 1?

Else (EBIT/Sales>0.05 → good EBIT):

   predict 1 (solvent)

Wait, this would make sense. Let me think again.

First split on EBIT/Sales. If that's low (<=0.05), then check working capital. If WC is also low (<=0.1), then insolvent. If WC is okay, maybe solvent. So prediction would be:

if nodes[0] (EBIT low):

   if nodes[1] (WC low):

      prediction 0

   else:

      prediction 1

else (EBIT high):

   prediction 1

But then the nodes list would have two entries, each representing whether their condition was met. 

Alternatively, let me structure the code accordingly. 

The nodes list will have two elements. The first node is EBIT/Sales <= 0.05. The second node is WC/TA <= 0.1. 

The function would be:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0, 0]
    # Node 0: EBIT/Sales <= 0.05?
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/Sales"] <= 0.05
    # Node 1 is only relevant if node0 is true. Its condition is WC/TA <=0.1
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.1 if nodes[0] else 0  # Wait, but maybe we should store the condition's truth regardless, even if not taken?

Wait, the problem says "the truth values of the inner nodes". So even if a node is not on the path taken, its condition's truth should be recorded. Because in a decision tree, each node's condition is checked along the path taken. Wait no, actually, in a decision tree, only the nodes along the path from root to leaf are evaluated. The other branches aren't. But the problem says "truth values of the inner nodes". Hmm, the example in the problem's given example shows that nodes[0] and nodes[1] are set regardless. For instance, in the example:

nodes[0] = X["HbA1c_level"] <=6.7 

nodes[1] = X["blood_glucose_level"] <=210 

So both are computed, even if the first node is false, nodes[1] is still computed. Wait, in the example's code, nodes[1] is set regardless of the first condition. So even if the first condition is not met, the second node's value is still recorded. That's because the nodes list is for all the inner nodes in the tree, not just the path taken. 

In a decision tree of depth 2, there are two inner nodes: the root (node0) and its left child (node1). The right child (if any) would be another node, but in the example's case, the tree might have only two nodes (root and one child). Wait, actually, in a depth 2 tree, the root has two children (left and right), so there are two inner nodes (the root and one child). But in the example given, the nodes list is of size 2. The example's tree structure is:

Root (node0) splits on HbA1c. If true, go to node1 (split on blood glucose). If false, go to a leaf. The node1 is an inner node only on the left side. But according to the code, nodes[1] is set even if the first condition is false. So the nodes list includes all the inner nodes in the tree, regardless of the path taken. Therefore, all inner nodes' conditions are evaluated, even if not on the path taken? Wait no, in the example code:

nodes[1] is computed regardless of node0. So even if node0 is false, nodes[1] is evaluated. That's because the code is just setting the condition's truth value for all nodes, not depending on the path. But in reality, in a decision tree, node1 is only reached if node0 is true. However, the problem's example's code is storing all inner nodes' conditions, even if they are not on the path. 

Therefore, in our function, we need to compute all inner nodes' conditions, even if they are not on the path taken. So for example, in the example, even if HbA1c is above 6.7 (node0 is false), the code still checks blood_glucose_level and stores that in nodes[1]. So the nodes list includes all inner nodes' conditions evaluated. 

Therefore, for my function, I must compute all the inner nodes' conditions, not just those on the path taken. 

Thus, the tree structure must have all inner nodes (each split node in the tree) evaluated. 

Now, the problem says "the decision tree has placeholders for thresholds, try to fill them with meaningful values". Since I don't have the actual tree structure, I need to make a reasonable one. Let me choose a simple structure with two inner nodes (depth 2):

Root node (node0): EBIT/Sales <= 0.05 → if yes, go to node1; else go to leaf (predict 1).

Node1: WC/TA <= 0.1 → if yes, predict 0; else predict 1.

Wait, but then the nodes list would have two entries, nodes[0] and nodes[1]. 

Wait, but in this structure, node1 is a child of node0. So the inner nodes are node0 and node1. So all inner nodes are included, even if node1 is only on the left path. But according to the example's code, all inner nodes are included, even if they are not on the path taken. 

So the code would be:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0, 0]  # two inner nodes
    # Node0 condition: EBIT/Sales <= 0.05
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/Sales"] <= 0.05
    # Node1 condition: WC/TA <= 0.1
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.1

    if nodes[0]:  # if EBIT/Sales is low (<=0.05)
        if nodes[1]:  # WC/TA is also low → predict 0 (insolvent)
            prediction = 0
        else:  # WC/TA is okay → maybe solvent?
            prediction = 1
    else:  # EBIT/Sales is okay, predict solvent
        prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes

Alternatively, maybe the second node is NI/Sales instead of WC/TA. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, the root could be Equity/TA. Suppose:

node0: Equity/TA <= 0.3 → if yes, check node1 (another feature like NI/Sales).

But I need to choose thresholds that are meaningful. 

Alternatively, let me pick EBIT/Sales as the first split, then Equity/TA as the second. 

Wait, perhaps a better split would be on NI/Sales. If a company has negative net income, that's a bad sign. 

Let me think of the following structure:

Root node (node0): NI/Sales <= -0.05 → if yes, predict 0 (insolvent). If no (NI is not too bad), then check node1.

Wait but that might not be a good split. Alternatively, perhaps:

Root node0: EBIT/Sales <= 0.05 → if yes, then check node1 (WC/TA). If no, predict 1. 

Node1: WC/TA <=0.1 → if yes, predict 0, else predict 1.

This structure would have two inner nodes (0 and 1), and three leaves. 

Alternatively, perhaps node0 is WC/TA, but that might not be as strong a predictor. 

Another approach: Let me think of the first split as EBIT/Sales. If EBIT is low, maybe the company is not profitable. Then, among those with low EBIT, if WC is low (maybe liquidity issues), then predict insolvent. 

Alternatively, if EBIT is okay, then predict solvent. 

Alternatively, maybe the second node is NI/Sales. 

Alternatively, let me try to structure it as follows:

node0: EBIT/Sales <= 0.05 → if yes, then node1 is WC/TA <=0.1 → predict 0 if yes, else 1.

Else (EBIT is okay), predict 1.

This seems plausible. 

Now, the code as above. 

Alternatively, perhaps the second node is NI/Sales. 

Suppose:

node0: EBIT/Sales <=0.05 → if yes, check node1 (NI/Sales <= -0.05 → predict 0 if yes, else 1).

Else, predict 1.

Thus, the code would be:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0, 0]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/Sales"] <=0.05
    nodes[1] = X["NI/Sales"] <=-0.05

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction=0
        else:
            prediction=1
    else:
        prediction=1
    return prediction, nodes

This structure may be better because if EBIT is low but NI is not too bad (maybe due to other factors), maybe they are solvent. 

Alternatively, maybe the second node is about debt or something else. Since we have limited features, the user provided features include EBIT, NI, WC (Working capital), etc. 

Alternatively, let me pick another feature for the second node. Let's see:

Suppose the first split is on EBIT/Sales. If low, check WC/TA. 

Alternatively, perhaps the second node is WC/TA. 

I think the initial structure I had is okay. Let me proceed with that.

So the code would be as follows. 

Testing:

Suppose a company has EBIT/Sales = 0.04 (<=0.05 → node0 is True). WC/TA is 0.09 (<=0.1 → node1 is True → prediction 0.

Another case: EBIT/Sales =0.06 (node0 is False → prediction 1.

Another case: EBIT=0.04, WC/TA=0.11 → node1 is False → prediction 1.

Another case: EBIT=0.03, WC=0.1 → exactly the threshold. Since the condition is <=, it's included → prediction 0.

This seems logical. 

Now, the thresholds need to be 'meaningful'. The thresholds I chose are 0.05 for EBIT/Sales (5% of sales as EBIT), and 0.1 for WC/TA (working capital to total assets ratio of 10%). These are arbitrary but plausible. 

Alternatively, maybe EBIT/Sales threshold is 0.1 (10%), but I'll stick with 0.05. 

Therefore, the final code is as above. 

Wait, but in the problem's example, the nodes are set as:

nodes[0] = X["HbA1c_level"] <=6.7 

nodes[1] = X["blood_glucose_level"] <=210 

So the code sets all nodes regardless of the path. 

Therefore, in my code, nodes[1] must be set even if node0 is false. Which in my code it is. 

Thus, the code is correct. 

I can write that as the answer.
</think>

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [False, False]
    # Node 0: Check if EBIT/Sales is <= 0.05
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/Sales"] <= 0.05
    # Node 1: Check if WC/TA is <= 0.1
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.1

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:
        prediction = 1      # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function evaluates the financial health of a company using two key metrics: EBIT/Sales and WC/TA (Working Capital to Total Assets). The decision tree structure is as follows:

1. **Root Node (Node 0):** If EBIT/Sales is less than or equal to 5% (0.05), proceed to Node 1. Otherwise, classify the company as solvent (prediction = 1).
2. **Node 1:** If WC/TA is less than or equal to 10% (0.1), classify as insolvent (prediction = 0). Otherwise, classify as solvent (prediction = 1).

The nodes list records the truth values of the conditions checked at each inner node, regardless of the path taken. This allows tracking of all decision points in the tree.
