<think>
Okay, I need to create a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 using the provided financial features to determine if a company is solvent or not. Let's start by understanding the features:

The features are all financial ratios:
1. Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets (EBIT/TA)
2. Net Income/Total Capital (NI/TC)
3. Sales/Total Assets (S/TA)
4. Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Sales (EBIT/S)
5. Net Income/Sales (NI/S)
6. Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA)
7. Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL)
8. Equity/Total Assets (E/TA)

The target is to classify companies as solvent or not. Solvency typically refers to a company's ability to meet its long-term debts and financial obligations. So, higher values in ratios like EBIT/TA, NI/TC, Sales/TA, etc., might indicate better solvency. But I need to figure out which features are the most important and how to split them.

Since the maximum depth is 2, the tree will have one root split and then two child splits. The root node will be the most important feature, and each child will split on the next important feature. 

First, I need to decide which feature is the most important. Let me think about each ratio:

- EBIT/TA: Measures profitability relative to assets. Higher might mean better.
- NI/TC: Net income over total capital. Also a profitability measure.
- Sales/TA: Asset turnover. Higher indicates efficient use of assets.
- EBIT/S: Profit margin before interest and taxes. Higher is better.
- NI/S: Net profit margin. Higher is better.
- WC/TA: Working capital as a ratio. Working capital is current assets minus current liabilities. If it's positive and high, maybe better liquidity.
- E/TL: Equity over total liabilities. Higher equity compared to liabilities could indicate less debt, so better solvency.
- E/TA: Equity ratio. Higher equity proportion is better.

I think the most critical ratios for solvency might be those related to equity (like E/TL or E/TA) or working capital. Alternatively, the Net Income ratios (NI/TC, NI/S) might be important, but they depend on profitability. 

Alternatively, the Working Capital/Total Assets ratio (WC/TA) could be key because working capital is a measure of liquidity, which is part of solvency. If a company has negative working capital, they might struggle to meet short-term obligations, which could lead to insolvency. So maybe WC/TA is a good first split. 

Alternatively, the Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL) ratio: if equity is much higher than liabilities, the company is less leveraged, which is good for solvency. For instance, if E/TL is high (like >1), that would mean equity is more than liabilities, so solvent. 

Another thought: The Equity/Total Assets (E/TA) is the equity ratio. A higher equity ratio (like above 0.5) would indicate better solvency. Maybe that's a good split. 

Alternatively, the Net Income/Sales (NI/S) ratio: if a company has negative net income (i.e., NI/S negative), that's a bad sign. So splitting on NI/S could be important. 

Wait, but the problem says "most important features" so perhaps we need to choose the best features first. Since I can't compute information gain here, I need to make an educated guess based on financial knowledge.

Let me think step by step.

First, the root node should be the feature that best splits the data into solvent and not solvent. Let's consider possible splits.

Suppose the root is E/TL (Equity over Total Liabilities). If this ratio is above a certain threshold, say 1.0, that would mean equity exceeds total liabilities. That's a strong indicator of solvency. Companies with E/TL >1 might be solvent. Those below might be at risk. But maybe the split isn't at 1.0. Alternatively, perhaps a lower threshold like 0.5.

Alternatively, the Working Capital/TA (WC/TA). A negative WC/TA would mean negative working capital, which is bad. So if WC/TA >0, maybe solvent, else not. But the split point might be different.

Another angle: The current ratio (current assets / current liabilities) is a common liquidity ratio, but WC/TA is different. WC is current assets minus current liabilities. So WC/TA = (CA - CL)/TA. If WC/TA is positive, that's better. But maybe the best split is whether this is positive or negative.

Alternatively, the Sales/TA ratio. High sales relative to assets indicate efficient use, but maybe not directly solvency. 

Alternatively, the EBIT/TA ratio: if EBIT is positive and high, the company is profitable, which helps solvency. But again, maybe the split is on EBIT/TA being above a certain threshold.

Alternatively, Net Income/Sales (NI/S). If NI/S is negative, the company is losing money, which is a bad sign. So a split on NI/S > 0 might be a key split.

Hmm. Let's think of possible splits.

Suppose first split is on E/TL (Equity over Total Liabilities). Let's say the threshold is 0.5. If E/TL >0.5, solvent; else, maybe need another split. But the depth is 2, so the root is first split, and then each child can have another split.

Alternatively, maybe the root is WC/TA. Let's say if WC/TA > 0.2, then solvent; else, need another split.

Alternatively, let's consider that in solvency analysis, the debt to equity ratio is common, but here we have equity over liabilities. So maybe E/TL is a good measure. Let me try constructing the tree.

Let me try to build a possible decision tree.

Root Node: Let's choose E/TL (Equity/Total Liabilities). Suppose the first split is at E/TL <= threshold. Let's say the threshold is 0.5. 

If E/TL > 0.5, then the company has more equity than liabilities (since E/TL = equity / total liabilities; so if >1, equity exceeds liabilities. Wait, actually, if E/TL is 0.5, equity is half of liabilities. To be solvent, maybe a higher threshold is better. Maybe the threshold is 0.3. 

Alternatively, perhaps the split is on E/TL. If E/TL is above a certain threshold, then solvent, else not. 

Alternatively, if the root is E/TL, and then the next splits could be on another ratio like WC/TA or NI/S.

Alternatively, let's think of another approach. Since I can't compute exact splits, I need to pick a feature that is most indicative. Let's say the most important feature is E/TL. Then, the first split could be E/TL <= 0.5. Then, for those with E/TL >0.5, maybe they are more likely solvent, but perhaps need another split. The next feature for the left branch (E/TL <=0.5) might be WC/TA. If WC/TA is above a certain threshold, maybe they are solvent, else not.

Alternatively, suppose the root is WC/TA. If WC/TA is above 0.2, then solvent; else, check another feature.

Alternatively, let's try to think of common ratios used in solvency. The debt to equity ratio is (Total Liabilities/Equity), which is inverse of E/TL. So if E/TL is high, the debt/equity is low, which is good. So E/TL is a key ratio.

Let me try building:

Root: E/TL (Equity/Total Liabilities)

Split at 0.3. So:

- If E/TL >0.3, then maybe solvent.

- If E/TL <=0.3, need another split.

Then, for the right branch (E/TL >0.3), maybe they are solvent, but perhaps not all. So perhaps need a second split here. Wait, but depth is 2, so after the root, each child can have one more split.

Wait the maximum depth is 2, which means the tree can have up to 2 levels. The root is depth 1, its children are depth 2. So each split from the root will be a leaf or another split. Wait, actually, the depth counts the number of splits from the root. So a depth of 2 allows three layers: root (depth 1), then two splits (depth 2). So each path can have two splits.

Wait, perhaps I need to structure it such that the root node splits into two branches, each of which can split once more. So the tree will have two levels of splits.

So first split (root), then each branch can split once more.

So, for example, root splits on feature A, then each of those two branches split on feature B or C.

So, the structure would be:

Root: Feature A > threshold?

   If yes: split on Feature B > threshold2?

      yes: class

      no: class

   If no: split on Feature C > threshold3?

      yes: class

      no: class

But since we can choose the same feature again, but probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps the second split on each branch is the next important feature.

Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to pick the first split as E/TL, then for the left child (E/TL <= threshold), split on WC/TA; and for the right child (E/TL> threshold), maybe split on another ratio like NI/S.

Alternatively, let's try this:

Root: E/TL (Equity/Total Liabilities) <= 0.4

- If yes (E/TL <=0.4): then solvent status depends on another feature, say Working Capital/TA.

   - For E/TL <=0.4, maybe split on WC/TA >0.2:

       - If WC/TA >0.2: solvent

       - Else: not solvent

- If no (E/TL>0.4): then maybe check another ratio like NI/Sales (Net Income/Sales)

   - If NI/Sales >0.05 (meaning 5% profit margin), then solvent.

   - Else: not solvent

Alternatively, the thresholds are arbitrary here since I don't have data, but need to set plausible numbers.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Working Capital/TA.

Root: WC/TA >0.1 ?

   If yes (WC/TA>0.1): then solvent, but maybe split on another feature like E/TL.

   If no (WC/TA <=0.1): then check another feature like NI/S.

Wait, but how to decide?

Alternatively, perhaps the most critical feature for solvency is the equity ratio (E/TA). If the equity over total assets is high, that's good. So root split on E/TA.

Suppose E/TA >0.5: then solvent, else split on WC/TA.

Hmm, but again, this is speculative.

Alternatively, let's think of the example given with the iris dataset. The first split there was on petal width, which is a key differentiator between setosa and the others. Similarly, in solvency, maybe the key differentiator is whether the company has positive net income. For instance, if Net Income/Sales (NI/S) is negative, they are not solvent. So first split on NI/S >0. If yes, then maybe split on another feature like E/TL. If no, then they are not solvent.

Wait, but if NI/S is negative, that means they are losing money, which would be a strong indicator of insolvency. So that could be a first split.

Alternatively:

Root: NI/S (Net Income/Sales) >0 ?

   If yes: then maybe check E/TL.

       - E/TL >0.3: solvent

       - else: not solvent

   If no: class: not solvent

But this way, the depth would be 2 for the left path. But the right path would end at depth 1. Since the maximum depth is 2, that's allowed.

Alternatively, maybe this is a possible tree. Let's see:

But maybe the first split is on NI/S >0. That's a very strong indicator. Suppose the first split is NI/S >0.

Then:

- If NI/S >0: then solvent status depends on another feature like E/TL.

   - For instance, split on E/TL >0.3: solvent, else not.

- If NI/S <=0: then class: not solvent.

This would be a depth of 2. The left branch (NI/S >0) splits again on E/TL, making depth 2. The right branch is a leaf.

Alternatively, another approach.

Alternatively, maybe the most important feature is E/TL, so let's try that.

Root split: E/TL (Equity/Total Liabilities) > 0.3

   If yes: then solvent, except maybe for some cases. So split on WC/TA >0.2

       - WC/TA >0.2 → solvent

       - else → not solvent

   If no (E/TL <=0.3): split on WC/TA >0.1?

       - WC/TA >0.1 → solvent?

       - else → not solvent?

Hmm, but the thresholds are tricky. Alternatively:

Root: E/TL >0.4

   - If yes:

       split on WC/TA >0.1 → solvent else not

   - If no:

       split on NI/S >0 → solvent else not

This way, the tree has depth 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on Working Capital/TA. A negative working capital (WC/TA <0) is bad, so:

Root: WC/TA >0?

   If yes:

       split on E/TL >0.3 → solvent else not

   If no (WC/TA <=0):

       split on NI/S >0 → solvent else not

This could be another possibility.

Alternatively, considering that the example given in the iris problem used petal width as the first split, which is a key feature to distinguish classes, perhaps here the most important ratio is the equity over total liabilities (E/TL). Let's proceed with that.

So here's a possible decision tree:

Root: E/TL (Equity/Total Liabilities) <= 0.3

   - If yes (E/TL <=0.3): then split on another feature, maybe WC/TA (Working Capital/TA) >0.2?

       - WC/TA >0.2 → solvent

       - else → not solvent

   - If no (E/TL >0.3): split on NI/S (Net Income/Sales) >0?

       - NI/S >0 → solvent

       - else → not solvent

This way, the tree has a maximum depth of 2. Each path from root to leaf has two splits.

Alternatively, the thresholds could be different. Let me think of plausible values.

Alternatively, maybe the first split on E/TL at 0.2. Companies with E/TL >0.2 are more likely solvent. Then, for those above, check if NI/S is positive. For those below, check WC/TA.

Alternatively, another structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on Net Income/Sales (NI/S) >0. Because without positive net income, the company might not be solvent. So:

Root: NI/S >0 ?

   - If yes:

       split on E/TL >0.3 → solvent else not

   - If no:

       class: not solvent

This would give depth 2 for the left branch. But the right branch ends at depth 1. This is acceptable as the maximum depth is 2.

Alternatively, if the first split is NI/S >0, then the left branch (positive NI/S) could split on Sales/TA (high sales relative to assets) > threshold, but that might not be as critical.

Hmm. Let me think again. The problem says "using the most important features". So I need to pick the two most important features, with the first being the most important.

In solvency analysis, key ratios include Debt-to-Equity (which is inverse of E/TL), Equity Ratio (E/TA), and Working Capital. Also, profitability ratios like Net Income/Sales are important because without profit, it's hard to meet obligations long-term.

Alternatively, the most important features could be:

1. Equity over Total Liabilities (E/TL)

2. Working Capital over Total Assets (WC/TA)

3. Net Income over Sales (NI/S)

So the decision tree would first split on E/TL, then on WC/TA or NI/S.

So let's try building the tree as follows:

Root: E/TL > 0.3

   - If yes:

       split on WC/TA >0.1 → solvent else not

   - If no (E/TL <=0.3):

       split on NI/S >0 → solvent else not

This way, both branches after the root have a second split, making maximum depth 2.

Alternatively, maybe the splits are the other way around. Let me adjust thresholds to make sense.

Suppose:

Root: E/TL (Equity/Total Liabilities) <= 0.5

   - If yes (E/TL ≤0.5): then check if NI/S >0?

       - If NI/S >0 → solvent

       - else → not solvent

   - If no (E/TL >0.5): check WC/TA?

       - WC/TA >0.2 → solvent

       - else → not solvent

Hmm, but I need to ensure that the splits make sense.

Alternatively, let's think of the example in the question where the first split separates setosa from others. Here, maybe the first split on E/TL separates companies with high equity over liabilities (solvent) from others. Then, for the less solvent ones, check another factor like NI/S or WC/TA.

Overall, I think choosing E/TL as the first split and then WC/TA or NI/S as the second split makes sense.

Alternatively, let's pick the splits as follows, using plausible thresholds:

Root: E/TL (Equity/Total Liabilities) > 0.3

   - If yes (E/TL >0.3): then solvent (no further split needed?)

But that would make depth 1 for that path, which is okay since the max is 2.

Wait, but to have depth 2, perhaps we need to split again.

Alternatively, perhaps:

Root: WC/TA (Working Capital/Total Assets) > 0.1

   - If yes:

       split on E/TL >0.3 → solvent else not

   - If no:

       split on NI/S >0 → solvent else not

This way, both branches have a second split, so maximum depth 2.

Alternatively, the first split on WC/TA, then E/TL and NI/S.

Alternatively, since I need to present a specific answer, perhaps the best approach is to structure it as:

Root: E/TL (Equity over Total Liabilities) > 0.3?

   - If yes: split on WC/TA > 0.2 → solvent else not

   - If no: split on NI/S > 0 → solvent else not

This uses the top two features after E/TL, which are WC/TA and NI/S.

Alternatively, maybe the splits are more straightforward:

Root: Equity/Total Liabilities > 0.3

   - Yes → solvent (no further split needed, so depth 1, which is allowed)

   - No → split on Working Capital/TA > 0.1

       - Yes → solvent

       - No → not solvent

This way, one path is depth 1, the other depth 2. This satisfies the maximum depth of 2.

Alternatively, that might be acceptable.

Alternatively, since the example in the question had all paths at depth 2, perhaps the user expects all leaves to be at depth 2. So we need to have both branches split again.

Thus, the tree would be:

Root: E/TL > 0.3?

   - Yes → split on WC/TA > 0.1 → solvent/else

   - No → split on NI/S > 0 → solvent/else

This way, both paths have a depth of 2.

Alternatively, the first split could be on NI/S >0, then split on E/TL.

Root: NI/S >0?

   - Yes → split on E/TL >0.3 → solvent/else

   - No → split on WC/TA >0.1 → solvent/else

This also gives depth 2.

I think the key is to select the two most important features after the first split. Since the user example used a single feature for the first split, then another for the second, I'll proceed with:

Root split on E/TL (Equity over Total Liabilities) > 0.3.

Then, for the yes branch, check WC/TA >0.1 for solvent.

For the no branch, check NI/S >0 for solvent.

Wait, but WC/TA and NI/S are different features. That could be a valid approach.

Alternatively, perhaps:

Root: E/TL >0.4?

   - Yes → solvent (no further split, so depth 1)

   - No → split on WC/TA >0.2 → solvent/else (depth 2)

This also meets max depth 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on a profitability metric like NI/S, since without profit, it's harder to be solvent long-term.

Root: Net Income/Sales >0?

   - Yes → split on E/TL >0.3 → solvent/else

   - No → split on Working Capital/TA >0.1 → solvent/else

This also has max depth 2.

I think I need to pick one and structure it clearly.

Given the example used a single feature first, then another, I'll go with:

Root: E/TL (Equity over Total Liabilities) > 0.3

   - If yes: solvent (no further split)

   - If no: split on WC/TA (Working Capital/TA) > 0.2?

       - Yes → solvent

       - No → not solvent

This way, the maximum depth is 2. The first path is depth 1, the second path is depth 2. This is acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe to have all leaves at depth 2, the structure is:

Root: E/TL >0.3?

   - Yes → split on NI/S >0 → solvent/else

   - No → split on WC/TA >0.1 → solvent/else

This way, all paths go to depth 2.

This might be better since the example had all splits proceeding to depth 2.

So, to formalize:

Root: Equity/Total Liabilities > 0.3?

   - Yes → split on Net Income/Sales >0?

       - Yes → solvent

       - No → not solvent

   - No → split on Working Capital/Total Assets >0.1?

       - Yes → solvent

       - No → not solvent

This uses E/TL and NI/S/WC/TA as the features, with maximum depth 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the second splits are more impactful. Let's try:

Root: Equity/Total Liabilities > 0.3

   - Yes → solvent (no split)

   - No → split on Working Capital/TA >0.1 → solvent/else

This allows the first path to be depth 1, but the second path depth 2. Since the maximum depth is 2, this is acceptable. Maybe this is simpler.

Alternatively, considering that equity over liabilities is the main factor, and if that's sufficient, then a simple tree.

Alternatively, considering that the problem says "using the most important features", so after E/TL, the next most important could be NI/S.

Thus, the answer could be structured as such.

After some consideration, I think the following structure is plausible:

Root: Equity over Total Liabilities (E/TL) > 0.3?

   - If yes (E/TL > 0.3): solvent

   - If no (E/TL ≤ 0.3): then split on Working Capital over Total Assets (WC/TA) > 0.1?

       - If yes → solvent

       - If no → not solvent

This way, the maximum depth is 2. The left branch ends at depth 1, and the right branch splits again, making depth 2.

Alternatively, if the WC/TA split is done on the left, but that might not make sense.

Alternatively, to have all branches at depth 2, perhaps:

Root: E/TL >0.4?

   - Yes → split on WC/TA >0.2 → solvent/else

   - No → split on NI/S >0 → solvent/else

This way, both paths have a second split.

Since I need to present an answer, I'll go with the first option where the first split on E/TL, then WC/TA for the lower E/TL group.

So the decision tree would be:

Root node: Is Equity over Total Liabilities (E/TL) > 0.3?

   - Yes → Class: Solvent (Leaf node)

   - No → Proceed to second split:

       Second node: Is Working Capital over Total Assets (WC/TA) > 0.1?

           - Yes → Class: Solvent

           - No → Class: Not Solvent

This ensures maximum depth of 2.

Alternatively, if the second split on the "No" branch of E/TL is on NI/S instead:

Root node: E/TL >0.3?

   - Yes → solvent

   - No → split on NI/S >0?

       - Yes → solvent

       - No → not solvent

This also works. The NI/S might be better here since if E/TL is low, but the company is profitable (NI/S>0), it might still be solvent.

But which is more important? WC/TA or NI/S?

Working Capital is a liquidity measure, while NI/S is profitability.

In solvency, both are important. Maybe the second split should be on another solvency ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the second split on the E/TL <=0.3 branch should check another equity ratio like E/TA.

But given the features provided, WC/TA and NI/S are available.

I think either is acceptable, but since the example used a single feature split, I'll proceed with WC/TA as the second split for simplicity.

Thus, the final answer would be structured as above.
</think>

**Decision Tree for Solvency Classification:**

1. **Root Node (First Split):**  
   *Equity over Total Liabilities (E/TL) > 0.3?*  
   - **Yes (E/TL > 0.3):**  
     *Class: Solvent* (No further split needed).  
   - **No (E/TL ≤ 0.3):** Proceed to the next split.

2. **Second Node (Split for E/TL ≤ 0.3):**  
   *Working Capital over Total Assets (WC/TA) > 0.1?*  
   - **Yes (WC/TA > 0.1):**  
     *Class: Solvent*.  
   - **No (WC/TA ≤ 0.1):**  
     *Class: Not Solvent*.

---

### Explanation:
- **First Split (E/TL):**  
  A company with **Equity/Total Liabilities > 0.3** is deemed solvent due to sufficient equity relative to liabilities, eliminating the need for further evaluation.  
- **Second Split (WC/TA):**  
  For companies with **E/TL ≤ 0.3**, a **Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.1** indicates adequate liquidity to cover short-term obligations, classifying them as solvent. If both metrics are low, the company is classified as **not solvent**.

This structure ensures a **maximum depth of 2**, aligning with the problem’s constraints and leveraging key financial ratios (equity, working capital) to assess solvency.

<think>
Okay, I need to create a Python function based on the provided decision tree structure. Wait, the user mentioned that the decision tree's structure isn't explicitly given here. Hmm, looking back at the problem statement, it says "format this decision tree as a Python function" but the actual tree isn't provided. Oh right, maybe the user expects me to come up with a sample decision tree based on the features they listed?

The features given are like EBIT/TA, NI/TC, Sales/TA, etc., and the target is whether a company is solvent (1) or not (0). Since the example they provided was for diabetes prediction with a depth 2 tree, perhaps I should design a similar simple decision tree for solvent prediction here.

Let me think of possible splits. The features are all ratios. Let's pick some key features. Maybe starting with EBIT/Sales, since that's a profitability measure. A higher EBIT/Sales ratio might indicate better performance. Let's say if EBIT/Sales is above a certain threshold, like 0.1 (10%), then proceed. 

Then, if that's true, maybe check another feature like Equity/TA. High equity over total assets could mean better solvency. Suppose if Equity/TA is above 0.3, then predict solvent (1), else not. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split could be on Sales/TA. A higher Sales/TA ratio indicates better asset utilization. Maybe split at 0.8. Then, if that's below, check NI/TC. 

Wait, but I need to make sure the thresholds are meaningful. Let me think of typical values. For instance, EBIT/Sales: if a company has EBIT of 10% of sales, that's okay. Maybe set the first split there. 

So let's structure it as a depth 2 tree. The example had two nodes and a list of two elements. Let me try that. 

First node: EBIT/Sales <= 0.1. If yes (so <=0.1), then check another condition. Wait, maybe it's better to structure the first split as EBIT/Sales > 0.1. 

Wait, in the example, the first node was HbA1c_level <=6.7. So the condition is a boolean. So in my case, first node could be (EBIT/Sales <= 0.05). If that's true, maybe go to another condition. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Equity/TL. Since Equity/TL is equity over total liabilities, a higher ratio might indicate better solvency. Let's say if Equity/TL is above 0.5, then solvent. 

Hmm, perhaps the user wants a simple structure. Let me try this:

Root node: EBIT/Sales <= 0.1 (if true, go left, else right). Then, if left, check another feature like WC/TA. Suppose if WC/TA is above 0.2, then predict 0 (insolvent), else 1. 

Wait, but the target is solvent (1 is good). Let me think again. 

Alternatively, root node could be Sales/TA. Suppose Sales/TA > 1.0 (meaning sales are higher than total assets, which might indicate efficiency). If that's true, then maybe check Equity/TA. 

Alternatively, let's try building a tree that makes sense. Let me pick features that are commonly used in solvency analysis. 

The Equity/TA (equity over total assets) is a solvency ratio. High equity means better solvency. So perhaps the first split is Equity/TA. Let's say if Equity/TA > 0.4, then the company is solvent (predict 1). If not, then check another ratio like NI/Sales. 

Wait, but the tree needs to have internal nodes. Let's structure it as:

First, check if Equity/TA > 0.4. If yes, predict solvent (1). If no, then check another condition. 

The second condition could be NI/Sales. If NI/Sales is above, say, 0.05 (5%), then maybe predict solvent, else not. 

Wait, but that would be a depth 2 tree. Let me structure it as:

nodes[0] = (X['Equity/TA'] > 0.4)

nodes[1] = (X['NI/Sales'] > 0.05)

Then, in the code:

if nodes[0] is True, then prediction is 1.

Else, check nodes[1]. If nodes[1] is true, prediction is 1 else 0.

Wait, but the nodes list needs to have the truth values of the inner nodes. The example had two nodes for depth 2. So in this case, the first node is the root, and the second is the left or right child. Wait, perhaps the tree structure is like:

Root (Equity/TA >0.4):

- if yes, then leaf (1)

- if no, then go to next node (NI/Sales >0.05):

   - if yes, then predict 1

   - else predict 0

Thus, nodes would be [Equity/TA >0.4, NI/Sales>0.05]. The first node is the first split, and the second node is the split in the right branch.

So the code would be:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0,0]
    nodes[0] = (X['Equity/TA'] > 0.4)
    nodes[1] = (X['NI/Sales'] > 0.05)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but in the example, the nodes are stored as a list, and the code uses nodes[0] and nodes[1]. The example had two nodes for depth 2. That's correct because depth 2 tree has two splits (root and one child). 

Another approach: Maybe use Sales/TA first. For instance, if Sales/TA is above 1.5, then solvent. Else, check EBIT/Sales. 

Alternatively, perhaps a different split. Let me think of possible threshold values based on the features.

Looking at the features:

EBIT/Sales: this is a profitability ratio. A higher ratio is better. Suppose a threshold of 0.05 (5%). 

NI/Sales: similarly, maybe 0.03.

Sales/TA: higher is better. 1.0 might be a threshold. 

Equity/TA: higher ratio means more equity financing, better solvency. Maybe 0.3 as a threshold.

So, let's try another structure. 

Root node: Sales/TA > 1.0. 

If yes, predict solvent (1). 

If no, then check EBIT/Sales > 0.05. 

If that's yes, then solvent. 

Else, not. 

Thus, the nodes would be:

nodes[0] = (X['Sales/TA'] > 1.0)

nodes[1] = (X['EBIT/Sales'] >0.05)

Then:

if nodes[0] → yes → prediction 1.

else, check nodes[1]. If yes → 1, else 0.

Thus code would be:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0,0]
    nodes[0] = (X['Sales/TA'] > 1.0)
    nodes[1] = (X['EBIT/Sales'] > 0.05)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction =1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction=1
        else:
            prediction=0
    return prediction, nodes

This way, the nodes list has two entries. 

Alternatively, let me think of the example given. The example had the first node being HbA1c_level ≤6.7, and second was blood_glucose_level ≤210. The structure was:

if node0 (HbA1c <=6.7):

   if node1 (blood_glucose ≤210 → yes →0 else 1)

else → 1.

So the left path after root required checking node1, and the right path of root directly gives 1. 

Hmm. So perhaps in my case, the first split leads to another split on the left, while the right goes to a leaf. Or vice versa. 

Alternatively, let's pick another structure. Suppose the first split is on EBIT/Sales ≤0.05 (if yes, then go to another split on NI/TC, else predict 1). 

Wait, but the target is solvent (1 is solvent). So maybe if EBIT/Sales is too low, then maybe not solvent, but need to check another feature. 

Alternatively, let's think of a common solvency ratio: the Equity/TA ratio. Let me structure the tree as:

Root: Equity/TA > 0.3. If yes → solvent (1). If no → check WC/TA. 

WC/TA (working capital over total assets): if WC/TA is positive, meaning working capital is positive (so WC/TA >0), then maybe solvent. 

Wait, but working capital is current assets minus current liabilities. So WC/TA being negative would be bad. So if WC/TA >0 → solvent. 

Thus:

Second node is WC/TA >0. 

Thus, nodes[0] = Equity/TA >0.3

nodes[1] = WC/TA>0

Then:

if nodes[0] → yes → predict 1.

Else, check node1. If yes (WC/TA>0 → predict 1 else 0)

Thus code:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0,0]
    nodes[0] = (X['Equity/TA'] >0.3)
    nodes[1] = (X['WC/TA']>0)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction =1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =1
        else:
            prediction =0
    return prediction, nodes

This seems plausible. The thresholds are 0.3 and 0. 

Alternatively, maybe Equity/TA is better at 0.4 as a threshold. 

Alternatively, let's choose another path. Since the example had two nodes, the tree must have two internal nodes (so depth 2). So the first split is first node, then one of its children is another internal node (second node), and the other is a leaf. 

So that's the structure. 

So which features to choose? Let's go with the first idea: Equity/TA and NI/Sales. 

Wait, maybe I should go with the example's structure. Let me try another approach. Let's pick two features and set thresholds. 

Suppose the first node is EBIT/Sales <=0.05. If yes → go to second node (NI/Sales <=0.02). Else → predict solvent (1). 

Wait, in the example, the first node's false path went to a different prediction. 

Wait, in the example:

if nodes[0] (HbA1c <=6.7):

   then check nodes[1], and based on that decide 0 or 1. 

else (nodes[0] is false → HbA1c>6.7), then predict 1 regardless. 

So in my case, if the first node is EBIT/Sales <=0.05:

if yes → check NI/Sales. 

else → predict 1 (solvent). 

Then, for the second node (NI/Sales <=0.02):

if yes → predict 0 (insolvent), else predict 1. 

Wait, but that would be:

if first node true (EBIT/Sales is low):

   if NI/Sales also low → 0

   else → 1?

Hmm, but that might make sense. 

Alternatively, perhaps the second node's condition is NI/Sales >0.03. 

Suppose:

nodes[0] = (EBIT/Sales <=0.05)

nodes[1] = (NI/Sales>0.03)

Then:

if nodes[0] → yes → check nodes[1]:

   if yes → solvent (1)

   else → insolvent (0)

else → solvent (1)

This way, the prediction would be:

if EBIT/Sales is good (above 0.05) → solvent.

If EBIT is low but NI/Sales is okay → solvent.

Else → not.

Thus the code would be:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0,0]
    nodes[0] = (X['EBIT/Sales'] <= 0.05)
    nodes[1] = (X['NI/Sales'] > 0.03)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        prediction = 1
    return prediction, nodes

This structure uses two nodes and depth 2. The nodes list has two entries. 

The thresholds here are 0.05 and 0.03. These are somewhat arbitrary, but the user said to fill placeholders with meaningful values. These are plausible thresholds for such ratios. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Sales/TA. Let's try:

nodes[0] = (X['Sales/TA'] <=1.2)

Then, if nodes[0] is true, check another feature like Equity/TL. 

Equity/TL is Equity over Total Liabilities. Suppose if Equity/TL >0.2 → solvent. 

Thus:

nodes[1] = (X['Equity/TL']>0.2)

Then:

if nodes[0] → yes (Sales/TA low), then check nodes[1]:

   if Equity/TL is okay → 1, else 0.

Else (Sales/TA high → predict 1).

This could be another structure. 

But maybe I should just pick one and proceed. 

The key is to have two nodes (so depth 2), and the code follows the structure. 

Looking back at the features, perhaps the first split is on EBIT/Sales, as it's a profitability ratio, which is crucial for solvency. 

I think the previous example with EBIT/Sales and NI/Sales is okay. Let's go with that. 

Wait, but the example code had the nodes list as 2 elements. The first node's condition is checked, and if true, the second node is checked. 

In my code above, the first node is EBIT/Sales <=0.05. 

If that's true, then check the second node (NI/Sales>0.03). 

Else, predict 1. 

Thus, the nodes list has two elements. 

The prediction is as per the logic. 

Alternatively, maybe the second node is WC/TA. Let me see. 

Alternatively, perhaps the second split is on Equity/TA. 

But the code structure is clear. 

Alternatively, let me check if the user has any constraints. The problem says "Now, I want you to act as a..." but the actual question is to write a function based on given features. 

Since the user hasn't specified a particular structure, I can choose any plausible two-node decision tree with meaningful thresholds. 

Another possibility is:

First node: Equity/TA >0.3 → solvent (1)

Else, check WC/TA>0 → solvent (1) else 0. 

Thus code:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0,0]
    nodes[0] = (X['Equity/TA'] >0.3)
    nodes[1] = (X['WC/TA']>0)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction =1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =1
        else:
            prediction=0
    return prediction, nodes

This is also good, and the thresholds are 0.3 and 0. 

I think this might be better because Equity/TA and WC/TA are directly related to solvency. 

The working capital (WC) being positive is important. 

Thus, this structure might be more appropriate. 

Therefore, I'll proceed with this code. 

So the final code would be:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0,0]
    # First node: Equity/TA > 0.3?
    nodes[0] = (X['Equity/TA'] > 0.3)
    # Second node: WC/TA > 0?
    nodes[1] = (X['WC/TA'] > 0)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes

This uses two features, and the thresholds are 0.3 and 0. 

Alternatively, maybe the first threshold is 0.4 for Equity/TA. 

But 0.3 is also okay. 

Alternatively, maybe the second node's condition is Equity/TL or something else. 

Alternatively, another approach: 

First node: Sales/TA > 1.0 → solvent (1)

Else → check EBIT/Sales >0.05 → solvent (1) else 0. 

Thus:

nodes[0] = (Sales/TA>1.0)

nodes[1] = (EBIT/Sales>0.05)

Then:

if nodes[0]: 1

else: 

   if nodes[1]:1 else 0

Thus code:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0,0]
    nodes[0] = (X['Sales/TA'] >1.0)
    nodes[1] = (X['EBIT/Sales']>0.05)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction =1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =1
        else:
            prediction =0
    return prediction, nodes

This is also plausible. 

Between these options, I think the Equity/TA and WC/TA are better because they directly relate to financial health and solvency. 

Hence, I'll choose that structure. 

Therefore, the answer is the function as follows, using Equity/TA and WC/TA with thresholds 0.3 and 0.
