Based on the provided features, I will induce a decision tree classifier to predict whether a company is solvent or not. Here's the resulting decision tree:

|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets <= 0.085
||--- class: insolvent
|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets > 0.085
||--- Equity/Total Liabilities <= 1.35
|||--- class: solvent
||--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 1.35
|||--- Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.25
||||--- class: insolvent
||||--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.25
||||--- class: solvent

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* The first feature, Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets, is used to split the data into two main branches. Companies with a low EBIT/TA ratio (<= 0.085) are more likely to be insolvent.
* For companies with a higher EBIT/TA ratio (> 0.085), the next feature considered is Equity/Total Liabilities. A lower equity-to-liability ratio (<= 1.35) indicates a higher risk of insolvency, and these companies are classified as solvent only if they have a high Working Capital/Total Assets ratio (> 0.25).
* Companies with a high EBIT/TA ratio (> 0.085) and a high Equity/Total Liabilities ratio (> 1.35) are generally considered solvent.

Note that this decision tree is not unique and may vary depending on the specific dataset used to train the model. Additionally, the performance of this decision tree should be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure its effectiveness in predicting company solvency.

Here is the Python function that represents the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.10
    nodes[1] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 1.35
    nodes[2] = X["WC/TA"] > 0.25

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # insolvent
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # solvent
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # solvent
            else:
                prediction = 0  # insolvent

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the feature values as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted class (1 if the company is solvent, 0 if it's insolvent) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Note that I've used thresholds that seem reasonable based on the provided feature descriptions. However, these thresholds may not be optimal and could be adjusted using techniques such as cross-validation or grid search to improve the model's performance.
