Based on the provided features, I will induce a decision tree classifier to predict whether a company is solvent or not. Here's the decision tree:

|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets <= 0.12
||--- Net Income/Total Capital <= 0.06
|||--- class: insolvent
||--- Net Income/Total Capital > 0.06
|||--- Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.25
||||--- class: insolvent
||||--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.25
|||||--- class: solvent
|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets > 0.12
||--- Equity/Total Liabilities <= 1.50
|||--- Net Income/Sales <= 0.04
||||--- class: insolvent
||||--- Net Income/Sales > 0.04
|||||--- class: solvent
||--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 1.50
|||--- class: solvent

This decision tree uses the most important features to classify a company as solvent or not. The tree is based on the following logic:

* If EBIT/TA (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets) is low (< 0.12), the company is likely to be insolvent, unless Net Income/TC (Net Income/Total Capital) is high (> 0.06).
* If EBIT/TA is high (> 0.12), the company's solvency depends on its Equity/TL (Equity/Total Liabilities). If Equity/TL is low (< 1.50), the company may still be insolvent, unless Net Income/Sales is high (> 0.04).
* Working Capital/TA (Working Capital/Total Assets) also plays a role in determining solvency when EBIT/TA is low.

Note that this decision tree is not exhaustive and might not cover all possible scenarios. In practice, you would want to validate the performance of this tree on a separate test dataset and consider using additional features or techniques (e.g., ensemble methods) to improve its accuracy.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: EBIT/TA <= 0.12
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.12
    
    # Node 1: NI/TC <= 0.06 (only considered if node 0 is True)
    nodes[1] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.06
    
    # Node 2: WC/TA <= 0.25 (only considered if node 0 and node 1 are True)
    nodes[2] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.25
    
    # Node 3: EBIT/TA > 0.12
    nodes[3] = not nodes[0]
    
    # Node 4: Equity/TL <= 1.50 (only considered if node 3 is True)
    nodes[4] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 1.50
    
    # Node 5: NI/Sales <= 0.04 (only considered if node 3 and node 4 are True)
    nodes[5] = X["NI/Sales"] <= 0.04
    
    # Node 6: Equity/TL > 1.50 (only considered if node 3 is True)
    nodes[6] = not nodes[4]
    
    prediction = None
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    elif nodes[3]:
        if nodes[4]:
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
        elif nodes[6]:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    
    # Replace NaN with 0 for node values that are not considered in the decision tree
    nodes = [int(node) if node is not None else 0 for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes
```
This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where each key corresponds to a feature. The function returns a tuple containing the predicted class label (1 = solvent, 0 = insolvent) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.

Note that I've used the same logic as before to implement the decision tree, but I've also added some comments to explain what each node represents. Additionally, I've replaced NaN with 0 for node values that are not considered in the decision tree.
