Based on the provided features, I will induce a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 to predict whether a company is solvent or not. Here's the decision tree:

|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets <= 0.10
||--- class: insolvent
|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets > 0.10
||--- Equity/Total Liabilities <= 1.20
|||--- class: solvent

Explanation:

* The most important feature is "Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets", which indicates a company's profitability. A low value (<= 0.10) suggests that the company is not generating enough earnings to cover its interest expenses, making it more likely to be insolvent.
* For companies with higher "Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets" values (> 0.10), the next most important feature is "Equity/Total Liabilities". A low value (<= 1.20) indicates that the company has high levels of debt compared to its equity, making it more likely to be insolvent.

Note: The actual threshold values may vary depending on the dataset and the specific problem you are trying to solve. These values are chosen arbitrarily for demonstration purposes.

The decision tree suggests that companies with low profitability (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets <= 0.10) are likely to be insolvent, while companies with higher profitability (> 0.10) but high debt levels (Equity/Total Liabilities <= 1.20) are also at risk of being insolvent. Companies with both high profitability and low debt levels are more likely to be solvent.

Here is the Python function that represents the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a company is solvent or not based on its financial features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
        'EBIT/TA', 'NI/TC', 'Sales/TA', 'EBIT/Sales', 'NI/Sales', 
        'WC/TA', 'Equity/TL', 'Equity/TA'

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 = insolvent, 1 = solvent) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05  # Low profitability threshold
    nodes[1] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 1.50  # High debt level threshold

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent due to high debt levels
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

Note that I've used the following thresholds:

* `EBIT/TA` <= 0.05: This threshold indicates low profitability, which is a common indicator of insolvency.
* `Equity/TL` <= 1.50: This threshold indicates high debt levels relative to equity, which can also contribute to insolvency.

You can adjust these thresholds based on your specific dataset and problem requirements.
