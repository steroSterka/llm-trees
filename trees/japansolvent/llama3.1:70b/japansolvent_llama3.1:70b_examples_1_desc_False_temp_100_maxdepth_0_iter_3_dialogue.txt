I'll build a decision tree using the features you provided. Since we want to classify whether a company is solvent or not, I'll assume that "solvent" means the company has a positive net income and "not solvent" means the company has a negative net income.

After analyzing the features, I've decided to use the following features in the decision tree:

1. Net Income/Total Capital
2. Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets
3. Equity/Total Liabilities

Here's the decision tree:
```
|--- Net Income/Total Capital <= 0.05
||--- class: not solvent
|--- Net Income/Total Capital > 0.05
||--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets <= 0.10
|||--- class: not solvent
||--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets > 0.10
|||--- Equity/Total Liabilities <= 1.50
||||--- class: not solvent
||||--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 1.50
|||||--- class: solvent
```
Here's how the decision tree works:

* If a company has a low Net Income/Total Capital ratio (<= 0.05), it's likely to be classified as "not solvent".
* If a company has a moderate Net Income/Total Capital ratio (> 0.05) but a low Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets ratio (<= 0.10), it's also likely to be classified as "not solvent".
* If a company has a high Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets ratio (> 0.10) but a low Equity/Total Liabilities ratio (<= 1.50), it may still be at risk of being "not solvent".
* However, if a company has a high Equity/Total Liabilities ratio (> 1.50), it's likely to have sufficient equity to cover its liabilities and is classified as "solvent".

Note that this decision tree is just an example and actual results may vary depending on the specific data used to train the model.

I'll build a decision tree using the provided features to classify whether a company is solvent or not.

After analyzing the features, I've constructed a decision tree that looks like this:

|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets <= 0.10
||--- class: Insolvent
|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets > 0.10
||--- Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.20
|||--- class: Insolvent
||--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.20
|||--- Equity/Total Liabilities <= 1.50
||||--- class: Solvent
|||--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 1.50
||||--- class: Highly Solvent

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* The first split is based on Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets (EBIT/TA), which measures a company's profitability relative to its assets. A low value indicates potential insolvency.
* If EBIT/TA is high, we look at Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA), which assesses a company's liquidity. A low value may indicate difficulties in meeting short-term obligations.
* If WC/TA is sufficient, we examine Equity/Total Liabilities (EQ/TL), which evaluates a company's solvency. A high value indicates a strong financial position.

The decision tree uses the following features:

1. Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets
2. Working Capital/Total Assets
3. Equity/Total Liabilities

These three features are the most important in determining whether a company is solvent or not, based on their ability to capture profitability, liquidity, and solvency aspects of a company's financial health.

Keep in mind that this decision tree is a simplified example and may not be applicable to all companies or situations. In practice, you would need to consider additional features, such as industry-specific ratios, macroeconomic conditions, and other factors that might impact a company's solvency.

Here is the Python function that represents the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: NI/TC <= 0.05
    nodes[0] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.05
    
    # Node 2: EBIT/TA <= 0.10 (only considered if Node 1 is False)
    nodes[1] = not nodes[0] and X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.10
    
    # Node 3: Equity/TL <= 1.50 (only considered if Node 2 is True)
    nodes[2] = nodes[1] and X["Equity/TL"] <= 1.50
    
    # Node 4: Final classification node
    nodes[3] = not nodes[0] and not nodes[1] and X["Equity/TL"] > 1.50

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    elif nodes[2]:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Solvent
=======
Here is the Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # EBIT/TA threshold determined based on common profitability ratios
    # A company with an EBIT/TA ratio less than 5% may be considered insolvent
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05
    
    # WC/TA threshold determined based on common liquidity ratios
    # A company with a WC/TA ratio less than 10% may have difficulties meeting short-term obligations
    nodes[1] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.10
    
    # Equity/TL threshold determined based on common solvency ratios
    # A company with an Equity/TL ratio greater than 2 may be considered highly solvent
    nodes[2] = X['Equity/TL'] > 2
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 2  # Highly Solvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
>>>>>>> main
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

Note that I've replaced the `None` values with `int(node)` to ensure that the output is a list of integers (0s and 1s). This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where each key corresponds to a feature. The output is a tuple containing the predicted class label (`prediction`) and a list of binary values representing the truth values of the inner nodes (`nodes`).
=======
In this function, we first initialize a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes. Then, we evaluate each condition and update the corresponding element in the `nodes` list.

Finally, based on the conditions evaluated, we assign a prediction value (0 = Insolvent, 1 = Solvent, or 2 = Highly Solvent) and return it along with the `nodes` list converted to integers.
