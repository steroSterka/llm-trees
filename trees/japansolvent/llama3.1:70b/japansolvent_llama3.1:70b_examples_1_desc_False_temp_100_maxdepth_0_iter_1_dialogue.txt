Based on the provided features, I'll build a decision tree to classify whether a company is solvent or not. Please note that this is a simplified example and actual decision trees may require more complex algorithms and larger datasets.

Here's the induced decision tree:

|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets <= 0.10
||--- class: Insolvent (Not Solvent)
|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets > 0.10
||--- Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.20
|||--- class: Insolvent (Not Solvent)
||--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.20
|||--- Equity/Total Liabilities <= 1.00
||||--- class: Insolvent (Not Solvent)
||||--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 1.00
|||||--- class: Solvent

This decision tree uses the following features in order of importance:

1. Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets (EBIT/TA): This feature is a common indicator of a company's profitability. A low value indicates poor financial performance.
2. Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA): This feature represents a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations. A low value may indicate liquidity issues.
3. Equity/Total Liabilities (E/T Liab): This feature measures a company's solvency and leverage. A high value indicates a healthier balance sheet.

The decision tree can be interpreted as follows:

* If EBIT/TA is less than or equal to 0.10, the company is likely insolvent.
* If EBIT/TA is greater than 0.10 but WC/TA is less than or equal to 0.20, the company may still be insolvent due to liquidity issues.
* If WC/TA is greater than 0.20 and E/T Liab is less than or equal to 1.00, the company's solvency is questionable.
* If all conditions are met (EBIT/TA > 0.10, WC/TA > 0.20, and E/T Liab > 1.00), the company is likely solvent.

Please note that this decision tree is a simplified example and actual models may require more complex algorithms, larger datasets, and additional features to achieve higher accuracy.
=======
Based on the provided features, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict whether a company is solvent or not. Here's the resulting tree:

|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets <= 0.075
||--- class: Insolvent
|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets > 0.075
||--- Equity/Total Liabilities <= 1.35
|||--- class: Insolvent
||--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 1.35
|||--- Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.25
||||--- class: Solvent
||||--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.25
|||||--- class: Solvent

Here's a brief explanation of the decision-making process:

1. The first split is based on Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets, which is a common indicator of profitability. Companies with lower values are more likely to be insolvent.
2. For companies with higher profitability (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets > 0.075), the next split is based on Equity/Total Liabilities, which measures the company's leverage. Companies with lower equity-to-liability ratios may have difficulty meeting their financial obligations.
3. Within this subset, the tree splits again based on Working Capital/Total Assets, which represents a company's liquidity position. Companies with higher working capital are more likely to be solvent.

Note that this decision tree is not definitive and might require further refinement or tuning using additional data. The choice of features and thresholds was made based on general financial analysis principles, but the performance of this classifier should be evaluated and validated with actual data.

Please let me know if you'd like to discuss any aspects of this decision tree or provide more information about the problem!

Here's the Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes for the given decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 4
    
    # Node 1: EBIT/TA <= 0.10
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.10
    
    # Node 2: WC/TA <= 0.20
    if not nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.20
    
    # Node 3: Equity/TL <= 1.00
    if not nodes[0] and not nodes[1]:
        nodes[2] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 1.00
    
    # Prediction based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0
    elif nodes[1]:
        prediction = 0
    elif nodes[2]:
        prediction = 0
    else:
        prediction = 1

    # Convert boolean values to integers (1 or 0) for the node list
    nodes = [int(node) if node is not None else None for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function uses the provided features and their keys exactly as specified. The decision tree has been implemented based on the previous example, with placeholders filled with meaningful values. The target variable encoding has also been taken into account.

Please note that this implementation assumes that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required features with their exact key spellings (uppercase, lowercase, spaces, etc.). If any feature is missing or has a different key spelling, the function may raise an exception or produce incorrect results.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting whether a company is solvent or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: EBIT/TA <= 0.075
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.075
    
    # Node 1: Equity/TL <= 1.35 (only considered if Node 0 is False)
    nodes[1] = False if nodes[0] else (X['Equity/TL'] <= 1.35)
    
    # Node 2: Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.25 (only considered if Node 0 is False and Node 1 is True)
    nodes[2] = False if not (not nodes[0] and nodes[1]) else (X['WC/TA'] <= 0.25)
    
    # Node 3: Not used in this tree
    nodes[3] = None
    
    # Node 4: Not used in this tree
    nodes[4] = None
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes[:3]] + [None]*2
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the feature values as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted class label (0 or 1, where 1 indicates that the company is solvent) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree. The list contains five elements: the first three correspond to the conditions at Nodes 0, 1, and 2, respectively, while the last two are `None` (since they are not used in this tree).
