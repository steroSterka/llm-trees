Based on the provided features, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict whether a company is solvent or not. Here's the resulting tree:

|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets <= 0.075
||--- class: Insolvent
|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets > 0.075
||--- Equity/Total Liabilities <= 1.35
|||--- class: Insolvent
||--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 1.35
|||--- Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.25
||||--- class: Solvent
||||--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.25
|||||--- class: Solvent

Here's a brief explanation of the decision-making process:

1. The first split is based on Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets, which is a common indicator of profitability. Companies with lower values are more likely to be insolvent.
2. For companies with higher profitability (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets > 0.075), the next split is based on Equity/Total Liabilities, which measures the company's leverage. Companies with lower equity-to-liability ratios may have difficulty meeting their financial obligations.
3. Within this subset, the tree splits again based on Working Capital/Total Assets, which represents a company's liquidity position. Companies with higher working capital are more likely to be solvent.

Note that this decision tree is not definitive and might require further refinement or tuning using additional data. The choice of features and thresholds was made based on general financial analysis principles, but the performance of this classifier should be evaluated and validated with actual data.

Please let me know if you'd like to discuss any aspects of this decision tree or provide more information about the problem!

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting whether a company is solvent or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: EBIT/TA <= 0.075
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.075
    
    # Node 1: Equity/TL <= 1.35 (only considered if Node 0 is False)
    nodes[1] = False if nodes[0] else (X['Equity/TL'] <= 1.35)
    
    # Node 2: Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.25 (only considered if Node 0 is False and Node 1 is True)
    nodes[2] = False if not (not nodes[0] and nodes[1]) else (X['WC/TA'] <= 0.25)
    
    # Node 3: Not used in this tree
    nodes[3] = None
    
    # Node 4: Not used in this tree
    nodes[4] = None
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes[:3]] + [None]*2
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the feature values as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted class label (0 or 1, where 1 indicates that the company is solvent) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree. The list contains five elements: the first three correspond to the conditions at Nodes 0, 1, and 2, respectively, while the last two are `None` (since they are not used in this tree).
