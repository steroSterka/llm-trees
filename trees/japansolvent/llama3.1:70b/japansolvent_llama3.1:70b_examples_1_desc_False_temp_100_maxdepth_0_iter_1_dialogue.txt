Based on the provided features, I'll build a decision tree to classify whether a company is solvent or not. Please note that this is a simplified example and actual decision trees may require more complex algorithms and larger datasets.

Here's the induced decision tree:

|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets <= 0.10
||--- class: Insolvent (Not Solvent)
|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets > 0.10
||--- Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.20
|||--- class: Insolvent (Not Solvent)
||--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.20
|||--- Equity/Total Liabilities <= 1.00
||||--- class: Insolvent (Not Solvent)
||||--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 1.00
|||||--- class: Solvent

This decision tree uses the following features in order of importance:

1. Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets (EBIT/TA): This feature is a common indicator of a company's profitability. A low value indicates poor financial performance.
2. Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA): This feature represents a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations. A low value may indicate liquidity issues.
3. Equity/Total Liabilities (E/T Liab): This feature measures a company's solvency and leverage. A high value indicates a healthier balance sheet.

The decision tree can be interpreted as follows:

* If EBIT/TA is less than or equal to 0.10, the company is likely insolvent.
* If EBIT/TA is greater than 0.10 but WC/TA is less than or equal to 0.20, the company may still be insolvent due to liquidity issues.
* If WC/TA is greater than 0.20 and E/T Liab is less than or equal to 1.00, the company's solvency is questionable.
* If all conditions are met (EBIT/TA > 0.10, WC/TA > 0.20, and E/T Liab > 1.00), the company is likely solvent.

Please note that this decision tree is a simplified example and actual models may require more complex algorithms, larger datasets, and additional features to achieve higher accuracy.

Here's the Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes for the given decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 4
    
    # Node 1: EBIT/TA <= 0.10
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.10
    
    # Node 2: WC/TA <= 0.20
    if not nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.20
    
    # Node 3: Equity/TL <= 1.00
    if not nodes[0] and not nodes[1]:
        nodes[2] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 1.00
    
    # Prediction based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0
    elif nodes[1]:
        prediction = 0
    elif nodes[2]:
        prediction = 0
    else:
        prediction = 1

    # Convert boolean values to integers (1 or 0) for the node list
    nodes = [int(node) if node is not None else None for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function uses the provided features and their keys exactly as specified. The decision tree has been implemented based on the previous example, with placeholders filled with meaningful values. The target variable encoding has also been taken into account.

Please note that this implementation assumes that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required features with their exact key spellings (uppercase, lowercase, spaces, etc.). If any feature is missing or has a different key spelling, the function may raise an exception or produce incorrect results.
