Based on the provided features, I will induce a decision tree classifier to predict whether a company is solvent or not. Since there are multiple financial ratios available, I'll select the most important ones and build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2.

Here's the induced decision tree:

|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets <= 0.10
||--- class: Insolvent
|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets > 0.10
||--- Equity/Total Liabilities <= 1.50
|||--- class: Insolvent
||--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 1.50
|||--- class: Solvent

The decision tree uses the following features:

* Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets (EBIT/TA): This ratio measures a company's profitability and ability to generate earnings from its assets.
* Equity/Total Liabilities (Equity/Liab): This ratio assesses a company's solvency by comparing its equity to its total liabilities.

The tree works as follows:

1. If EBIT/TA is less than or equal to 0.10, the company is classified as Insolvent, indicating poor profitability and potential financial distress.
2. If EBIT/TA is greater than 0.10, the company's equity-to-liabilities ratio (Equity/Liab) is evaluated:
	* If Equity/Liab is less than or equal to 1.50, the company is classified as Insolvent, suggesting high leverage and potential solvency issues.
	* If Equity/Liab is greater than 1.50, the company is classified as Solvent, indicating a relatively healthy balance sheet.

Please note that this decision tree is a simplified example and may not capture all the complexities of real-world financial analysis. In practice, more features and a deeper tree might be necessary to achieve accurate results.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for predicting whether a company is solvent or not:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
    nodes[1] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 1.50
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
```
This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, which contains the feature values for a company. The function uses these features to predict whether the company is solvent or not.

The decision tree has two inner nodes:

* Node 0: Checks if EBIT/TA (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Total Assets) is less than or equal to 0.05. If true, the company is predicted to be insolvent.
* Node 1: Checks if Equity/TL (Equity / Total Liabilities) is less than or equal to 1.50. If true, the company is predicted to be insolvent.

If Node 0 is false, the function checks Node 1. If Node 1 is false, the company is predicted to be solvent.

The function returns a tuple containing the prediction (0 for insolvent, 1 for solvent) and the list of node values (0 or 1) representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Note that I've used thresholds of 0.05 for EBIT/TA and 1.50 for Equity/TL, which are reasonable values based on general financial analysis guidelines. However, these thresholds may need to be adjusted depending on the specific dataset and industry being analyzed.
