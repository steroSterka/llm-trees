Based on the features you provided, I will build a decision tree classifier to determine whether a company is solvent or not.

After analyzing the features, I have decided to use the following feature importance:

1. Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)/Total Assets
2. Net Income/Total Capital
3. Equity/Total Liabilities

These three features are commonly used in financial analysis to assess a company's solvency. The decision tree is as follows:

|--- EBIT/Total Assets <= 0.05
||--- class: insolvent
|--- EBIT/Total Assets > 0.05
||--- Net Income/Total Capital <= 0.10
|||--- Equity/Total Liabilities <= 1.50
||||--- class: insolvent
|||--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 1.50
||||--- class: solvent
||--- Net Income/Total Capital > 0.10
|||--- class: solvent

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* If EBIT/Total Assets is less than or equal to 0.05, the company is likely insolvent.
* If EBIT/Total Assets is greater than 0.05 and Net Income/Total Capital is less than or equal to 0.10, the company's solvency depends on its Equity/Total Liabilities ratio. If this ratio is less than or equal to 1.50, the company is likely insolvent. Otherwise, it is solvent.
* If EBIT/Total Assets is greater than 0.05 and Net Income/Total Capital is greater than 0.10, the company is likely solvent.

Note that this decision tree is a simplification and actual solvency analysis may involve more complex factors and considerations.

Based on the features you provided, I will induce a decision tree classifier to predict whether a company is solvent or not. Here's the decision tree:

|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets <= 0.08
||--- class: insolvent
|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets > 0.08
||--- Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.22
|||--- class: insolvent
||--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.22
|||--- Equity/Total Liabilities <= 1.15
||||--- class: solvent
|||--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 1.15
||||--- class: solvent

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* The first feature used is Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets (EBIT/TA). A low value of this ratio may indicate that the company is not generating enough earnings to cover its interest expenses, which could lead to insolvency. If EBIT/TA is less than or equal to 0.08, the company is classified as insolvent.
* For companies with higher EBIT/TA values, the next feature used is Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA). A low value of this ratio may indicate that the company has liquidity problems, which could also lead to insolvency. If WC/TA is less than or equal to 0.22, the company is classified as insolvent.
* For companies with higher WC/TA values and EBIT/TA values, the next feature used is Equity/Total Liabilities (EQ/TL). A high value of this ratio indicates that the company has a strong equity position relative to its liabilities, which could reduce the risk of insolvency. If EQ/TL is greater than 1.15, the company is classified as solvent.

Please note that this decision tree is based on a simple analysis and may not capture all the complexities of solvency prediction. In practice, more features and a larger dataset would be used to build a more accurate model.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting whether a company is solvent or not:

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:
>>>>>>> main

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
<<<<<<< HEAD
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05
    nodes[1] = X['NI/TC'] <= 0.10 and not nodes[0]
    nodes[2] = X['Equity/TL'] <= 1.50 and nodes[1]

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    elif nodes[2]:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the feature values as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted class label (0 or 1) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Note that I've used the same threshold values as before, but you can adjust them based on your specific dataset. Also, make sure to replace `X` with the actual feature dictionary when calling this function.
=======
    
    # Node 0: EBIT/TA <= 0.08
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.08
    
    # Node 1: Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.22
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.22
    
    # Node 2: Equity/Total Liabilities <= 1.15
    nodes[2] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 1.15

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
    
    # Convert boolean values to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted class label (0 or 1) and a list of integers representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Note that I've used the exact key spellings provided in your prompt to ensure accuracy. Also, I've assumed that the target variable is encoded as 0 for insolvent and 1 for solvent, based on the description provided.
