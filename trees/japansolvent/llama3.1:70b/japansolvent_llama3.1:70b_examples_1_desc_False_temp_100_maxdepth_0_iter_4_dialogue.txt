Based on the features you provided, I will build a decision tree classifier to determine whether a company is solvent or not.

After analyzing the features, I have decided to use the following feature importance:

1. Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)/Total Assets
2. Net Income/Total Capital
3. Equity/Total Liabilities

These three features are commonly used in financial analysis to assess a company's solvency. The decision tree is as follows:

|--- EBIT/Total Assets <= 0.05
||--- class: insolvent
|--- EBIT/Total Assets > 0.05
||--- Net Income/Total Capital <= 0.10
|||--- Equity/Total Liabilities <= 1.50
||||--- class: insolvent
|||--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 1.50
||||--- class: solvent
||--- Net Income/Total Capital > 0.10
|||--- class: solvent

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* If EBIT/Total Assets is less than or equal to 0.05, the company is likely insolvent.
* If EBIT/Total Assets is greater than 0.05 and Net Income/Total Capital is less than or equal to 0.10, the company's solvency depends on its Equity/Total Liabilities ratio. If this ratio is less than or equal to 1.50, the company is likely insolvent. Otherwise, it is solvent.
* If EBIT/Total Assets is greater than 0.05 and Net Income/Total Capital is greater than 0.10, the company is likely solvent.

Note that this decision tree is a simplification and actual solvency analysis may involve more complex factors and considerations.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting whether a company is solvent or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05
    nodes[1] = X['NI/TC'] <= 0.10 and not nodes[0]
    nodes[2] = X['Equity/TL'] <= 1.50 and nodes[1]

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    elif nodes[2]:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the feature values as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted class label (0 or 1) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Note that I've used the same threshold values as before, but you can adjust them based on your specific dataset. Also, make sure to replace `X` with the actual feature dictionary when calling this function.
