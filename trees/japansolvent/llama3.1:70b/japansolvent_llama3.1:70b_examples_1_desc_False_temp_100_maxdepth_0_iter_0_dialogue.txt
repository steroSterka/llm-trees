Based on the provided features, I will induce a decision tree classifier to predict whether a company is solvent or not. Here's the resulting decision tree:

|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets <= 0.085
||--- class: Insolvent
|--- Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets > 0.085
||--- Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.255
|||--- class: Insolvent
||--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.255
|||--- Equity/Total Liabilities <= 1.335
||||--- class: Solvent
|||--- Equity/Total Liabilities > 1.335
||||--- class: Solvent

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* The first split is based on Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets, which is a measure of profitability. If this ratio is less than or equal to 0.085, the company is likely insolvent.
* For companies with higher profitability (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets > 0.085), the next split is based on Working Capital/Total Assets. This ratio measures liquidity. If working capital is relatively low (less than or equal to 0.255), the company may still be at risk of insolvency.
* For companies with sufficient liquidity (Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.255), the final split is based on Equity/Total Liabilities, which measures solvency. If this ratio is less than or equal to 1.335, the company is likely solvent.

Note that this decision tree is not necessarily optimal and may require further refinement using techniques such as pruning or feature selection. Additionally, the performance of the decision tree should be evaluated on a separate test dataset to estimate its accuracy.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # First split: EBIT/TA <= 0.085
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.085
    
    # Second split: WC/TA <= 0.255 (only if first condition is false)
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.255 and not nodes[0]
    
    # Third split: Equity/TL <= 1.335 (only if second condition is false)
    nodes[2] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 1.335 and not nodes[1]
    
    prediction = int(not any(nodes))
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```
This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted class label (0 or 1) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Note that I used the feature keys exactly as specified, including case and punctuation. Also, I used the target variable encoding provided in the problem statement to determine the prediction value.
