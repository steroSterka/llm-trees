Based on the provided features, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not. Here's my attempt:

|--- Educational level attained <= 5
||--- Prestige score for father's occupation <= 15
|||--- class: Not Taken (likely primary terminal leaver)
||--- Prestige score for father's occupation > 15
|||--- Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score <= 40
||||--- class: Not Taken
||||--- Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score > 40
|||||--- class: Taken
|--- Educational level attained > 5
||--- Type of school = vocational
|||--- class: Not Taken (vocational schools may not offer certificates)
||--- Type of school != vocational
|||--- sex = male
||||--- class: Taken
|||--- sex = female
||||--- class: Taken

Please note that this decision tree is an interpretation based on the provided features and might not be optimal or accurate. The actual performance of the model would depend on the quality of the data and the specific problem being addressed.

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

* I started by splitting on Educational level attained, as it seems to be a strong indicator of whether a student is likely to take the leaving certificate.
* For those with lower educational attainment (<= 5), I used Prestige score for father's occupation as a proxy for socio-economic status. Those with lower prestige scores are more likely to not take the certificate.
* Within this group, I further split on Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score, assuming that students with higher test scores might be more motivated or capable of taking the certificate.
* For those with higher educational attainment (> 5), I used Type of school as a feature. Vocational schools may not offer certificates, so I assigned this group to Not Taken.
* Within the remaining groups (non-vocational schools and higher education level), I split on sex, assuming that males might be more likely to take the certificate.

Please let me know if you'd like me to adjust or refine this decision tree!

Here is the Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Educational level attained <= 5
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    
    # Node 1: Prestige score for father's occupation <= 15 (for educational level <= 5)
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Prestige_score"] <= 15
    else:
        nodes[1] = False
    
    # Node 2: DVRT <= 40 (for educational level <= 5 and prestige score <= 15)
    if nodes[0] and nodes[1]:
        nodes[2] = X["DVRT"] <= 40
    else:
        nodes[2] = False
    
    # Node 3: Type of school is vocational (for educational level > 5)
    if not nodes[0]:
        nodes[3] = X["Type_school"] == 2
    else:
        nodes[3] = False
    
    # Node 4: Sex is male (for educational level > 5 and type of school is not vocational)
    if not nodes[0] and not nodes[3]:
        nodes[4] = X["Sex"] == 1
    else:
        nodes[4] = False

    prediction = 0  # default to "not taken"
    
    if nodes[0]:  # educational level <= 5
        if nodes[1]:  # prestige score <= 15
            if not nodes[2]:  # DVRT > 40
                prediction = 1
        else:  # prestige score > 15
            prediction = 1
    elif nodes[3]:  # educational level > 5 and type of school is vocational
        pass  # default to "not taken"
    elif nodes[4]:  # educational level > 5, type of school is not vocational, and sex is male
        prediction = 1
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function uses the features provided to make a prediction about whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not. The `nodes` list represents the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree, with 1 indicating True and 0 indicating False.
