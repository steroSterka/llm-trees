To build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 using the provided features, I'll follow these steps:

1. Select the most important feature as the root node.
2. Split the data based on this feature and create child nodes.
3. For each child node, select the next most important feature (if available) and split the data again.

Based on the features you provided, here is a possible decision tree with a maximum depth of 2:

|--- Educational level attained <= 5
||--- Type of school == primary terminal leaver: No certificate
||--- Type of school != primary terminal leaver: Certificate taken
|--- Educational level attained > 5
||--- Prestige score for father's occupation <= 15: Certificate taken
||--- Prestige score for father's occupation > 15: Certificate taken

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* The root node is "Educational level attained" because it seems to be a strong indicator of whether someone takes their school leaving certificate or not.
* If the educational level attained is low (<= 5), we check the type of school. If it's a primary terminal leaver, it's likely that no certificate was taken. Otherwise, a certificate was taken.
* If the educational level attained is high (> 5), we check the prestige score for father's occupation. If it's relatively low (<= 15), a certificate was taken. If it's higher (> 15), a certificate was also taken.

Note that this decision tree is not based on actual data, but rather on my understanding of the features and their potential relationships with the target variable. In practice, you would need to train a decision tree classifier using a dataset containing these features and the corresponding labels (certificate taken or not).

Here is the Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes based on your decision tree:


```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    nodes[1] = (X["Type_school"] == 0) if nodes[0] else (X["Prestige_score"] > 15)

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1 if nodes[1] else 0
    else:
        prediction = 1

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```
Here is the explanation of how I arrived at this function:

* The decision tree is converted into a Python function `predict` that takes a dictionary `X` containing the features as input.
* The inner nodes are represented by the list `nodes`.
* In the first level, we check if `Educational_level` is less than or equal to 5. This is stored in `nodes[0]`.
* If `nodes[0]` is True, then we check if `Type_school` is primary_terminal_leaver (i.e., `Type_school == 0`). Otherwise, we check if `Prestige_score` is greater than 15.
* Based on these conditions, the prediction of whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not (`target`) is determined.
