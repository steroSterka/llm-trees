Based on the provided features, I will build a decision tree classifier using the most important features. Here is the induced decision tree:

|--- Educational level attained <= 5
||--- class: No certificate taken
|--- Educational level attained > 5
||--- Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score <= 50
|||--- class: No certificate taken
||--- Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score > 50
|||--- sex = male
||||--- class: Certificate taken
|||--- sex = female
||||--- Prestige score for father's occupation > 15
|||||--- class: Certificate taken
||||--- Prestige score for father's occupation <= 15
|||||--- Type of school = secondary
||||||--- class: Certificate taken
||||||--- Type of school != secondary
|||||||--- class: No certificate taken

Note that the tree is not necessarily unique, and different decision trees can be induced based on the same features. This tree represents one possible classification model.

Here's a brief explanation of the decision-making process:

* The first split is based on the Educational level attained feature, which seems to be a strong predictor of whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not. If the educational level is low (<= 5), it's likely that no certificate was taken.
* For individuals with higher education levels (> 5), we consider their Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score. A score <= 50 indicates a lower likelihood of taking the certificate.
* Among those with higher test scores, males are more likely to have taken the certificate than females.
* For females with higher test scores, we examine their father's occupation prestige score. Those with higher prestige scores (> 15) are more likely to have taken the certificate.
* Finally, for females with lower prestige scores, we consider the type of school attended. Those attending secondary schools are more likely to have taken the certificate than those attending other types of schools.

Keep in mind that this is just one possible decision tree, and you may need to refine it based on additional data or domain knowledge.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier based on the provided features and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Educational_level <= 5
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    
    # Node 1: DVRT <= 50
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 50
    
    # Node 2: Sex == male (i.e., Sex > 0)
    nodes[2] = X["Sex"] > 0
    
    # Node 3: Prestige_score > 15
    nodes[3] = X["Prestige_score"] > 15
    
    # Node 4: Type_school != primary_terminal_leaver (i.e., Type_school > 0)
    nodes[4] = X["Type_school"] > 0

    if not nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    if nodes[4] and X["Type_school"] == 1: # secondary_terminal_leaver
                        prediction = 1
                    else:
                        prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values as input and returns a tuple consisting of the predicted class label (`prediction`) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes (`nodes`). The decision tree is implemented using nested if-else statements to mimic the structure of the original tree. Note that I've used the exact keys from your features dictionary, paying close attention to their spelling (uppercase, lowercase, spaces, etc.).
