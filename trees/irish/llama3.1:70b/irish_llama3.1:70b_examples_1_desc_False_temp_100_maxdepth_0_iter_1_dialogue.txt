Based on the provided features, I will induce a decision tree classifier. Here is the decision tree:

|--- Educational level attained <= 6
||--- class: No certificate taken
|--- Educational level attained > 6
||--- Prestige score for father's occupation <= 15
|||--- Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score <= 50
||||--- class: No certificate taken
|||--- Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score > 50
||||--- class: Certificate taken
||--- Prestige score for father's occupation > 15
|||--- class: Certificate taken

Note that I've used the following feature importance:

1. Educational level attained (most important)
2. Prestige score for father's occupation
3. Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score

I didn't use the "sex" and "Type of school" features in this decision tree, as they don't seem to be strongly correlated with the target variable.

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* If the educational level attained is 6 or lower, it's likely that no certificate was taken.
* If the educational level attained is higher than 6, we look at the prestige score for father's occupation. If it's 15 or lower, and the verbal reasoning test score is 50 or lower, it's likely that no certificate was taken. Otherwise, a certificate was taken.
* If the prestige score for father's occupation is higher than 15, it's likely that a certificate was taken.

Keep in mind that this decision tree is induced based on my analysis of the provided features and may not be optimal or exhaustive.

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree classifier we previously discussed. The function takes in a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple of `(prediction, nodes)` where `prediction` is the predicted target variable value (0 or 1) and `nodes` is a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Educational level attained <= 6?
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 6
    
    # If yes, predict 0 (no certificate taken)
    if nodes[0]:
        return 0, nodes
    
    # Otherwise, proceed to the next node
    else:
        # Node 2: Prestige score for father's occupation <= 15?
        nodes[1] = X["Prestige_score"] <= 15
        
        # If yes, predict based on DVRT score
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 3: DVRT score <= 50?
            nodes[2] = X["DVRT"] <= 50
            
            # If yes, predict 0 (no certificate taken)
            if nodes[2]:
                return 0, nodes
            
            # Otherwise, predict 1 (certificate taken)
            else:
                return 1, nodes
        
        # Otherwise, predict 1 (certificate taken)
        else:
            return 1, nodes
```

Here's a breakdown of the function:

* We define an empty list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
* The first node checks if the educational level attained is less than or equal to 6. If true, we predict 0 (no certificate taken) and return immediately.
* Otherwise, we proceed to the next node, which checks if the prestige score for father's occupation is less than or equal to 15. If true, we check the DVRT score.
* The third node checks if the DVRT score is less than or equal to 50. If true, we predict 0 (no certificate taken).
* Otherwise, we predict 1 (certificate taken) and return.

You can test this function by passing in a dictionary `X` containing the feature values, like so:
```python
X = {
    "Educational_level": 7,
    "Prestige_score": 12,
    "DVRT": 60
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(prediction)  # Output: 1
print(nodes)  # Output: [False, True, False]
```
