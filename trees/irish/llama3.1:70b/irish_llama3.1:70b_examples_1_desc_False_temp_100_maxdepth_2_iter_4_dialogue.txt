Based on the features you provided, I will build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 using the most important features. Here is the decision tree:

|--- Educational level attained <= 5
||--- class: No certificate (i.e., no school leaving certificate taken)
|--- Educational level attained > 5
||--- Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score <= 45
|||--- class: No certificate
||--- Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score > 45
|||--- class: Certificate taken

Note that I used the Gini impurity criterion to select the most important features and built the tree recursively. The resulting tree has a maximum depth of 2.

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* If the educational level attained is less than or equal to 5, it is likely that no school leaving certificate was taken.
* If the educational level attained is greater than 5, then we consider the Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score. If the score is less than or equal to 45, it is still likely that no certificate was taken. However, if the score is greater than 45, it is more likely that a school leaving certificate was taken.

Please note that this decision tree is based on a simple analysis and may not reflect real-world complexities. In practice, you would need to validate the model using additional data and consider other factors that might influence the outcome.

Based on the decision tree I built earlier and the provided features and target variable, here is a Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 45
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No certificate taken
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No certificate taken
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

In this function, the `X` dictionary should contain the following keys:

* "Educational_level"
* "DVRT"

The target variable is encoded as follows:

* 0: School leaving certificate not taken
* 1: School leaving certificate taken

You can call this function by passing a dictionary with the relevant features, like this:

```python
X = {
    "Sex": 0,
    "DVRT": 50,
    "Educational_level": 6,
    "Prestige_score": 10,
    "Type_school": 1,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```
