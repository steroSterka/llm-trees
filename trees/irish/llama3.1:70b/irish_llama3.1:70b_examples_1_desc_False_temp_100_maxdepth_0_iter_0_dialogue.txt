Based on the features you provided, I will build a decision tree classifier using the most important features. Here is the result:

|--- Educational level attained <= 6
||--- Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score <= 48
|||--- class: no school leaving certificate taken
||--- Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score > 48
|||--- class: school leaving certificate taken
|--- Educational level attained > 6
||--- Prestige score for father's occupation <= 14
|||--- class: school leaving certificate taken
||--- Prestige score for father's occupation > 14
|||--- class: school leaving certificate taken

Here's how I arrived at this decision tree:

1. I started by selecting the most important feature, which is Educational level attained. This feature has a strong correlation with whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not.
2. For individuals with an Educational level attained of 6 or less, I used the Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score as the next feature to split on. Those with lower scores are more likely not to have taken the school leaving certificate.
3. For individuals with an Educational level attained greater than 6, I used the Prestige score for father's occupation as the next feature to split on. However, since most individuals with higher educational levels tend to take the school leaving certificate regardless of their father's occupation prestige, this feature doesn't provide much additional information.

Note that the sex and Type of school features did not contribute significantly to the decision tree in this case. The resulting decision tree is relatively simple and uses only three features: Educational level attained, Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score, and Prestige score for father's occupation.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 6
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 48
    nodes[2] = X["Prestige_score"] <= 14

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, [int(n) for n in nodes]
```
Here's how the function works:

* We first initialize an array `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
* We then evaluate each condition and store the result in the corresponding index of `nodes`.
* We use the conditions to make predictions. If `Educational_level` is less than or equal to 6, we check if `DVRT` is less than or equal to 48. If it is, we predict 0 (not taken). Otherwise, we predict 1 (taken).
* If `Educational_level` is greater than 6, we check if `Prestige_score` is less than or equal to 14. However, since most individuals with higher educational levels tend to take the school leaving certificate regardless of their father's occupation prestige, this condition doesn't provide much additional information, and we predict 1 (taken) in both cases.
* Finally, we return the prediction and the array `nodes`, where each element is an integer representation of the truth value of the corresponding inner node (1 if true, 0 if false).
