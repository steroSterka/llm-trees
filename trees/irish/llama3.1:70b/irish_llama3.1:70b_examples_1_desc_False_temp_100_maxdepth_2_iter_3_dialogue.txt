Based on the provided features, I will induce a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 to predict whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not.

After analyzing the features, here is the induced decision tree:

|--- Educational level attained <= 6
||--- class: No Certificate (assuming lower educational levels are less likely to take the certificate)
|--- Educational level attained > 6
||--- Prestige score for father's occupation <= 15
|||--- class: No Certificate (assuming lower prestige scores may indicate lower socio-economic status, making it less likely to take the certificate)
||--- Prestige score for father's occupation > 15
|||--- class: Certificate (assuming higher prestige scores may indicate higher socio-economic status, making it more likely to take the certificate)

Note that I have used a threshold of 6 for Educational level attained and 15 for Prestige score for father's occupation. These thresholds are somewhat arbitrary and might require tuning based on actual data.

Here's why I chose these features:

* Educational level attained is a strong indicator of academic achievement, which may influence the likelihood of taking the school leaving certificate.
* Prestige score for father's occupation can be seen as a proxy for socio-economic status, which may also impact the decision to take the certificate.

The other features (sex and Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score) might have some correlation with the outcome, but I prioritized Educational level attained and Prestige score for father's occupation based on their potential direct influence on academic achievement and socio-economic factors.

Based on the provided features and target variable, I will create a Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. Here is the induced decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    nodes[1] = X["Prestige_score"] >= 15
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* The first inner node checks if the Educational level attained is less than or equal to 5. If true, it predicts that the school leaving certificate is not taken (target variable = 0).
* If the first condition is false, the second inner node checks if the Prestige score for father's occupation is greater than or equal to 15. If true, it predicts that the school leaving certificate is taken (target variable = 1). Otherwise, it predicts that the certificate is not taken.

Note that I have used a threshold of 5 for Educational level attained and 15 for Prestige score for father's occupation based on their potential direct influence on academic achievement and socio-economic factors. These thresholds might require tuning based on actual data.

Also, note that this decision tree has a maximum depth of 2 as requested.
