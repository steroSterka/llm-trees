Based on the features you provided, I will build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 to classify whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not.

Here is the decision tree:

|--- Educational level attained <= 5
||--- class: Not Taken (assuming lower educational levels are less likely to take the certificate)
|--- Educational level attained > 5
||--- Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score <= 50
|||--- class: Not Taken (assuming lower test scores indicate a lower likelihood of taking the certificate)
||--- Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score > 50
|||--- class: Taken

Note that I have used the most important features based on my understanding of the problem. The decision tree suggests that:

* Individuals with lower educational levels (<= 5) are less likely to take the school leaving certificate.
* Among those with higher educational levels (> 5), individuals with lower Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Scores (<= 50) are also less likely to take the certificate.

Please let me know if you would like me to adjust or refine this decision tree.

Here is the decision tree function in Python format based on the features and target variable provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 50
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
```

In this decision tree:

* The first inner node (`nodes[0]`) checks if the `Educational_level` is less than or equal to 5. If true, it predicts that the school leaving certificate is not taken (target variable value of 0).
* The second inner node (`nodes[1]`) checks if the `DVRT` score is less than or equal to 50. If true and the first condition is false, it also predicts that the school leaving certificate is not taken.
* If both conditions are false, it predicts that the school leaving certificate is taken (target variable value of 1).

The function returns a tuple containing the predicted target variable value and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
