Based on the features you provided, I will induce a decision tree classifier. Here is the result:

|--- Educational level attained <= 4
||--- class: No school leaving certificate taken
|--- Educational level attained > 4
||--- Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score <= 70
|||--- sex == male
||||--- class: No school leaving certificate taken
||||--- sex == female
|||||--- Prestige score for father's occupation <= 10
||||||--- class: No school leaving certificate taken
||||||--- Prestige score for father's occupation > 10
|||||||--- class: School leaving certificate taken
|||--- Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score > 70
||||--- Type of school == secondary
|||||--- class: School leaving certificate taken
||||--- Type of school != secondary
|||||--- class: No school leaving certificate taken

Here's a brief explanation of the tree:

* The most important feature is Educational level attained, which splits the data into two main groups. Those with an educational level of 4 or below are likely to not have taken the school leaving certificate.
* For those with an educational level above 4, the Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score is the next most important feature. Those with a score of 70 or below are more likely to not have taken the certificate, especially if they are male.
* For females with an educational level above 4 and a test score of 70 or below, the Prestige score for father's occupation becomes relevant. If the prestige score is high (above 10), they are more likely to have taken the school leaving certificate.
* Finally, for those with a test score above 70, the Type of school attended is the most important feature. Those who attended a secondary school are more likely to have taken the school leaving certificate.

Note that this tree is not necessarily the only possible decision tree, and different algorithms or methods may produce slightly different results.

Here is the Python function that represents the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 70
    nodes[2] = X["Sex"] == 1  # male
    nodes[3] = X["Prestige_score"] > 10
    nodes[4] = X["Type_school"] == 1  # secondary school

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0
            else:  # female
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0

    return prediction, [int(x) for x in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values. The function returns two values: the predicted class label (0 or 1), and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.

Note that I used the provided encoding for the features to make the comparisons, and I replaced `None` with a meaningful value (`int(x)`) when creating the list of node values.
