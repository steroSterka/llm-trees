Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to create a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 to determine whether someone has taken their school leaving certificate. The features provided are sex (male/female), Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score, Educational level attained (0-10), Prestige score for father's occupation (0-28), and Type of school (secondary, vocational, primary terminal leaver). 

First, I need to recall how decision trees work. The tree splits the data based on the feature that provides the most information gain or the highest Gini impurity reduction. Since the maximum depth is 2, the tree can have at most one split from the root, leading to two leaves, or two splits if the root has two children each with one split. Wait, actually, a depth of 2 means the root is level 1, its children are level 2, so each root node can have two children, and each of those can have their own children, but since the max depth is 2, the children of the root can't have their own children. So the tree structure would be root (depth 1), then its two children (depth 2), which are leaves. Alternatively, if the first split leads to two nodes, each of those can't split further. So the tree can have up to 3 levels: root (depth 1), then two branches (depth 2) which are leaves. 

Wait, actually, decision tree depth is counted from the root as depth 1. So a maximum depth of 2 means the deepest leaves are at level 2. So the root node is depth 1, and each split can have children at depth 2. So the tree can have splits only once from the root. So the structure would be the root node split into two branches, each branch is a leaf. Alternatively, maybe the root can split into two nodes, which can each split once more, but that would make the depth 3. Hmm, maybe I'm confused here. Let me confirm.

Wait, the user says "maximum depth of 2". Typically, the depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node. So the root is depth 0 or 1? Different sources might define it differently. Let me think in terms of scikit-learn's definition. In scikit-learn, the depth of a leaf node is the number of splits from the root. So a tree with depth 2 would have leaves at a maximum of two splits from the root. So root (depth 0) -> split to depth 1, then split again to depth 2. But the user says maximum depth of 2, so maybe they mean the maximum depth allowed is 2, so the tree can have splits up to two levels. Alternatively, maybe they consider the root as depth 1, so two splits would be depth 3. Hmm, perhaps the user's example can clarify. 

Looking at the example given:

The example decision tree for the iris dataset has:

- Root split on petal width <=0.8, leading to setosa (depth 2? Or depth 1 and 2). The structure is written as:

|--- petal width (cm) <= 0.80
||--- class: setosa
|--- petal width (cm) > 0.80
||--- petal width (cm) <= 1.75
|||--- class: versicolor
||--- petal width (cm) > 1.75
|||--- class: virginica

So in this case, the root split is petal width <=0.8. The left branch leads directly to setosa (a leaf). The right branch splits again on petal width <=1.75, leading to versicolor, and then the other branch goes to virginica. So the depth here is 2 for the root's right child's split. So the total depth is 3? Or maybe the user counts levels as the number of nodes. But in their example, the maximum depth would be 3? Hmm, perhaps the user's example is a depth of 2, but maybe they consider the depth as the number of splits. Alternatively, maybe the user is considering the depth as the maximum number of edges from root to leaf. In the example, the left branch has one edge (depth 1), the right has two edges (depth 2). So the maximum depth is 2 for that tree. So the user's desired maximum depth here is 2. So in the problem, the decision tree for the school leaving certificate should have a max depth of 2. That means the longest path from the root to a leaf can have two edges (i.e., two splits). Wait, no, if depth is the number of edges, then two edges would mean three nodes (root, first split, second split). So the maximum depth is two, so the longest path can only have two edges (i.e., one split from root to first child, then another split from there). Wait, but in the example given, the right branch has two splits (from root to first split, then to the next), making the depth 2. So in that case, the maximum depth is indeed 2. So the user wants the tree to have a maximum depth of two, so each leaf is at most two edges away from the root. Therefore, the tree can have splits up to two levels. 

So for the school leaving certificate problem, I need to choose the best feature to split on first, then each of those splits can split again on another feature, but only up to two levels. Wait, but with max depth 2, the root is split into children (depth 1?), then each child can split again (depth 2?), but the leaves can't go further. Wait, maybe I need to just structure it so that after two splits from root, you hit leaves. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user's example is structured as the root being depth 1, and each split adds a level. So in their example, the root is depth 1, then the next splits are depth 2. Thus, the maximum depth is 2, so no further splits beyond that. Therefore, the decision tree can have only one split from the root (so the root's children are leaves), or two splits if the first split leads to nodes that can split again, but not further. So the tree can have a root, which splits into two nodes (depth 2), which are leaves, or the root splits into two nodes (depth 1), and one of those splits again into two leaves (depth 2). 

Wait, perhaps the key is that the maximum depth is two, so each path from root to leaf can have at most two nodes (i.e., one split). Wait, no. Let me think again. If depth is the number of edges from root to the node, then the root is depth 0. A leaf at depth 2 would be two edges away. So the tree can have splits at depth 0 (root), then depth 1, then depth 2. But maximum depth is 2, so nodes can go up to depth 2. So the tree can have two splits. For example:

Root (depth 0) splits into two nodes (depth 1). One of those can split again into two nodes (depth 2). So the tree would have leaves at depth 1 and 2. But the maximum depth allowed is 2, so that's okay. Alternatively, both children of root can split again, resulting in four leaves at depth 2. 

Wait, but the user's example has a tree where one branch goes to depth 2 (the right side splits again) and the left branch ends at depth 1. So that's allowed as maximum depth is 2. 

Therefore, for the school leaving certificate problem, I can have a root node splitting into two children. Each of those children can split again into their own children, but those children would be at depth 2, so that's okay. Thus, the tree can have up to four leaves. But the user wants maximum depth of 2, so we need to ensure that no path exceeds two edges from the root. 

Now, given the features, I need to decide which features to use. The features are:

- Sex (male/female)
- Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score (probably a continuous variable)
- Educational level attained (0-10, so ordinal)
- Prestige score for father's occupation (0-28, continuous?)
- Type of school (categorical: secondary, vocational, primary terminal leaver)

The target variable is whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not (binary classification).

To build the decision tree, I need to choose the best split at each node. Since I can't actually compute the information gain without data, I have to make some assumptions based on typical scenarios or common sense.

First, the root node would be the feature that gives the best split. Let me think which feature might be most important. 

The type of school might be important because, for example, "primary terminal leaver" might mean they didn't go to secondary school, so maybe they wouldn't have taken the leaving cert. Whereas secondary or vocational might have higher chances. But that's an assumption.

Alternatively, the Educational level attained (0-10) might be important. If someone has a higher educational level, they might have taken the leaving cert. For example, maybe a score above a certain level indicates they took it.

The Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score could be a predictor—if they did well, they might have taken the exam.

Father's prestige might influence their education path; higher prestige might correlate with higher likelihood of taking the leaving cert.

Sex might be a factor, but maybe less so.

So, perhaps the first split is on the school type. Let's suppose:

Root split: Type of school. Suppose splitting between "primary terminal leaver" vs the others (secondary or vocational). If the school type is primary terminal leaver, then they probably didn't take the leaving cert. The other two might have higher chance. 

Then, for those not primary terminal leaver, the next split could be on Educational level attained. For example, if educational level is above a certain threshold, they took it; else not.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Educational level attained. Suppose if education level is above 7, then they took the leaving cert, else not. But then the second split could be on school type or another feature.

Alternatively, maybe the Drumcondra test score is a good first split. Higher scores might correlate with taking the exam.

But since I don't have data, I need to make educated guesses.

Alternatively, considering that "primary terminal leaver" might be a strong indicator. So let's try that as the root.

Root: Type of school.

Left branch: If school type is "primary terminal leaver" → then class: Not taken (since they left at primary level, so they didn't take the leaving cert, which is usually for secondary). 

Right branch: If school type is secondary or vocational → then split again on another feature. Since depth is 2, that split must be at depth 2. Wait, no. Wait, the root is split into two branches. The left branch is a leaf (depth 1?), and the right branch can split again to depth 2. 

Wait, let's structure it as follows:

Root node: Split on Type of school. 

Left branch: School type is "Primary terminal leaver" → class: Not taken (leaving cert not taken). 

Right branch: School type is Secondary or Vocational → further split on another feature (e.g., Educational level attained). 

For the right branch, perhaps Educational level: if Educational level is above a certain value (say, 6) → class: Taken, else Not taken.

Alternatively, maybe the split is on Father's prestige score. Suppose higher prestige means more likely to take it.

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on Drumcondra score. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Educational level. 

Alternatively, let's think of another approach. Maybe the most important feature is Educational level. Suppose that if someone has an educational level of 7 or higher, they took the leaving cert. So root split on Educational level. 

Left branch: Educational level ≤6 → Not taken. 

Right branch: Educational level >6 → further split on School type. 

Wait, but the maximum depth is 2. So the root split on educational level, then the right branch splits again on school type. That would give two leaves on the right (depth 2), and the left is a leaf at depth 1. That's within the max depth of 2. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Drumcondra score. Suppose if the score is above a threshold, they took it. 

Alternatively, let's consider possible splits and see which makes sense.

Suppose the first split is on School type, as it's categorical with three options. Splitting into primary terminal leaver vs others. That's a good first split because it might directly indicate if they could have taken the leaving cert. Since leaving cert is usually for secondary school, those in primary terminal leavers probably didn't. So that's a strong split. 

Then, for the non-primary terminal leavers, maybe the next split is on Educational level. For example, if their educational level is above a certain point (say, 7), they took it. Otherwise, maybe not. 

Alternatively, maybe the educational level is 10 (the max), but that's too high. 

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on Father's prestige score. Suppose higher prestige (like above 15) means they took it. 

Alternatively, maybe the test score is more important. Let's think of another angle.

Suppose that the key is whether they went to secondary or vocational school. If they went to secondary, they likely took the leaving cert. But vocational might have different requirements. Hmm, perhaps the educational level is more important. 

Alternatively, let's think of the features in terms of their possible impact:

- School type: Strong indicator (primary terminal vs others)
- Educational level: Direct measure of attainment, so key.
- Father's prestige: Socioeconomic factor influencing education
- Test score: Academic ability might correlate with taking the exam.

Sex might be less important. 

So the first split is probably school type. Then, the next split on educational level. 

Putting this together:

Root split: Type of school. 

If "Primary terminal leaver" → class: Not taken. 

Else (Secondary or Vocational), then split on Educational level. 

Suppose the split is at 7: 

If Educational level >7 → Taken, else Not taken. 

Alternatively, maybe split at 5. 

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on Drumcondra score. 

Alternatively, maybe the second split on Father's prestige. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Educational level, and second on school type. 

But to form a decision tree, the first split has to be the best feature. 

Alternatively, let's think of the data. Suppose that among people who went to secondary or vocational schools, those with higher educational levels took the leaving cert, while those with lower might not. 

Another approach: since the example uses a continuous variable for petal width, maybe here the Drumcondra score or educational level (continuous/ordinal) would be used first. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Drumcondra score. Suppose if the score is above 60 (assuming it's a percentage?), then more likely to have taken the cert. 

But without data, it's hard. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on school type, as it's a categorical variable that can partition the data into three, but decision trees handle that by splitting into multiple branches. Wait, but in decision trees, for a categorical feature with more than two classes, it can split into multiple branches, but that might complicate the depth. However, the user's example only splits into two branches each time (even though petal width is continuous). 

Wait, in the example given by the user, the first split on petal width (continuous) divides into two branches. For a categorical variable with three options like school type, how would the split be? The algorithm would choose a split that best separates the classes. For example, maybe split between primary terminal leaver vs the rest, since primary is a clear case. 

So maybe the first split on school type into two branches: Primary terminal vs others. 

Then, for the others, split on another feature. 

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on educational level. 

Another possibility: The most important feature might be educational level. Suppose that if the educational level is above a certain value, they took the leaving cert. 

Alternatively, let's think step by step. 

Assuming we start with school type as the first split:

Root node: Type of school

Split condition: School type = "Primary terminal leaver" → left branch (class: Not taken)

Right branch: School type is Secondary or Vocational → further split.

Now, for the right branch (those in Secondary or Vocational schools), we need another split. The best split here could be educational level. Suppose that if Educational level is above 6, they took it, else not.

Alternatively, maybe the split is on Father's prestige. Higher prestige might mean more resources, so more likely to take the exam.

Alternatively, maybe test score. Higher scores → more likely to take the exam.

Suppose the second split is on Educational level. Let's pick a threshold, say 7. 

So the decision tree would look like:

|--- Type of school = Primary terminal leaver

||--- class: Not taken

|--- Type of school = Secondary or Vocational

||--- Educational level attained >7 → class: Taken

||--- Educational level attained <=7 → class: Not taken

Alternatively, maybe the split for educational level is at 5. 

Alternatively, perhaps the second split is on Drumcondra score. 

Alternatively, if the school type is Secondary vs Vocational, but since they are in the same branch, maybe another feature is better. 

Alternatively, the second split could be on Father's prestige. Suppose if Father's prestige > 15 → Taken, else Not taken. 

But without data, it's hard to know. 

Alternatively, let's think of another approach: the key is that to take the leaving cert, you need to have completed secondary education. So school type (Secondary) versus Vocational might have different outcomes. But since Secondary and Vocational are grouped, maybe the next split distinguishes between them. 

Wait, but Vocational might also lead to taking the leaving cert, depending on the country's system. 

Alternatively, maybe the educational level is the measure. 

Alternatively, let's consider that the second split is on school type again, but that doesn't make sense since we already split on school type. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on educational level. 

Root split: Educational level ≤6 → Not taken

Educational level >6 → further split on school type.

Wait, but school type for those with high educational level would be Secondary or Vocational, so maybe split between Secondary and Vocational. 

But since school type has three categories, but after the first split, the high educational group would exclude primary, so it's two categories. 

Alternatively, maybe the second split on school type for the high educational group would split into secondary vs vocational. Suppose Secondary students are more likely to have taken it than vocational. 

So:

Root split: Educational level >6 → right, else left (Not taken)

Right branch (Educational level >6):

Split on school type: if Secondary → Taken, else (Vocational) → Not taken.

But that might be a possible structure. 

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on Drumcondra score. 

Alternatively, the first split is on Drumcondra score. Suppose if score > 60 → Taken, else split on school type. 

But it's getting too speculative. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on school type, then on educational level. 

Given that the user's example used a continuous variable first, perhaps here a continuous variable like educational level is better as the first split. 

Suppose root split on educational level. 

If Educational level <=5 → Not taken.

Else (6-10) → split on school type.

Wait, but school type for those with higher education would be secondary or vocational. 

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on school type again. 

Alternatively, the second split on Father's prestige. 

Alternatively, let's try:

Root: Educational level.

Split at 7:

If educational level >7 → Taken.

Else (<=7) → further split on school type.

If school type is Secondary → Taken, else (Vocational or Primary) → Not taken.

But primary would already be in the lower educational level. 

Alternatively, this is getting too convoluted. 

Perhaps the best educated guess is:

Root split on school type. Primary terminal leavers don't take it. 

Then, for others, split on educational level. 

Therefore, the decision tree would be:

|--- Type of school = Primary terminal leaver → Not taken

|--- Type of school ≠ Primary terminal leaver:

||--- Educational level attained > X → Taken

||--- Educational level attained ≤ X → Not taken

Assuming X is a threshold, say 6.

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on Drumcondra score. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Educational level, then school type. 

Alternatively, let's consider that the user's example used a continuous variable first. So maybe here, the first split is on educational level (continuous/ordinal), then school type (categorical). 

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to first split on school type (categorical), then on educational level (continuous). 

Given the options and common sense, I'll go with school type as the first split, then educational level for the non-primary group. 

So the structure would be:

Root node: Type of school.

Left branch (Primary terminal leaver): Class = Not taken.

Right branch (Secondary or Vocational):

Split on Educational level attained. Suppose the threshold is 6.

If Educational level >6 → Taken.

Else → Not taken.

Alternatively, the threshold might be higher. 

Alternatively, maybe 5.

Alternatively, maybe the split is on Father's prestige. 

Alternatively, let's think of another angle: maybe the key is that to take the leaving cert, you have to be in secondary school and have a certain educational level. 

Alternatively, the second split is on Drumcondra score. 

Alternatively, the second split is on Father's prestige. 

But given the information, I think the most straightforward is school type first, then educational level. 

Therefore, the final decision tree would look like this:

Root: Type of school.

- If school type is "Primary terminal leaver" → Class: Not taken.

- Else (Secondary or Vocational):

   - Split on Educational level attained. Let's say the threshold is 6.

      - If Educational level >6 → Class: Taken.

      - Else → Class: Not taken.

Alternatively, maybe the threshold is higher, like 7 or 8. 

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on Drumcondra score, but without data, it's hard. 

Another possibility: the second split is on Father's prestige. Suppose if Father's prestige score is above a threshold (say, 15), then Taken, else Not. 

But again, without data, it's a guess. 

Alternatively, the second split could be on Sex. But that's probably less important. 

Given that the user's example used a continuous variable first, maybe here the first split is on a continuous variable like educational level. 

Suppose:

Root: Educational level attained.

- If educational level <=5 → Not taken.

- Else (6-10):

   - Split on school type.

      - If school type is Secondary → Taken.

      - Else (Vocational) → Not taken.

But this assumes that Vocational students with higher education might not take it. 

Alternatively, maybe Vocational students also take it, so split on another feature. 

Alternatively, the second split on Drumcondra score. 

This is getting too speculative. 

Perhaps the best approach is to pick the school type as first split, then educational level for the non-primary group. 

Thus, the decision tree would be structured as follows.
</think>

The decision tree is structured to first split on the **Type of school**, as this is a strong indicator of whether someone would have taken the leaving certificate. The key steps are as follows:

### Root Node: **Type of School**
- **Left Branch (Primary terminal leaver):**  
  **Class:** *Not Taken*  
  *(Primary terminal leavers typically exit education before secondary, so they wouldn't take the leaving cert.)*

- **Right Branch (Secondary or Vocational):**  
  Further split on **Educational level attained** to determine likelihood of taking the exam.  

### Second Split (Right Branch): **Educational Level Attained**
- **Threshold:** Assume a threshold of **7+** (e.g., completing secondary education).  
  - **Left Branch (Educational Level ≤7):**  
    **Class:** *Not Taken*  
    *(Lower educational attainment may indicate not completing requirements for the exam.)*  
  - **Right Branch (Educational Level >7):**  
    **Class:** *Taken*  
    *(Higher educational attainment suggests completion of leaving cert requirements.)*  

---

### Final Decision Tree Structure:
```
|--- Type of school = Primary terminal leaver → **Not Taken**  
|--- Type of school ≠ Primary terminal leaver:  
||--- Educational level ≤7 → **Not Taken**  
||--- Educational level >7 → **Taken**  
```

### Key Assumptions:
1. **School Type:** Primary terminal leavers cannot take the leaving cert.  
2. **Educational Level:** A threshold (e.g., 7) represents the minimum requirement to have taken the exam (common in secondary completion).  

This structure balances logical assumptions and aligns with the example provided (using a categorical split first, followed by a continuous split).

<think>
Okay, I need to create a Python function that implements a decision tree based on the provided features and their descriptions. The function should return a prediction and a list of node truth values. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, the features given are Sex, DVRT, Educational_level, Prestige_score, Type_school, and the target is whether the school leaving certificate is taken (0 or 1). The example shows that nodes are conditions that split the data, and each node's truth value (1 if condition met, 0 otherwise) is stored in a list.

The user mentioned that if there are placeholders for thresholds, I should try to fill them with meaningful values. Since the example uses specific thresholds like 6.7 for HbA1c_level, I need to come up with plausible thresholds for each node in my decision tree.

The decision tree structure isn't provided, so I need to make one up. Let me think of a reasonable structure. Since I'm creating a simple decision tree, maybe start with the most impactful features first. Let's see the features again:

Sex: 0 or 1 (female/male)
DVRT: a test score (probably numeric, but the description doesn't specify the range, but since it's a test, maybe a score like 0-100?)
Educational_level: has various categories (0-10), which might indicate different educational stages. Maybe higher numbers indicate more education? Not sure, but perhaps the educational level affects whether they take the certificate.
Prestige_score: 0-28. Higher might mean higher prestige, so maybe more likely to take the certificate.
Type_school: 0-2. Different school types might influence the outcome.

Let's think of a possible decision tree structure. Maybe start with DVRT (since it's a test score related to reasoning, which might correlate with taking the certificate). Suppose the first split is DVRT <= some threshold. Let's say 50 (assuming DVRT ranges up to 100). If DVRT is below 50, maybe they are less likely to take it (predict 0), but need to think further.

Alternatively, perhaps the prestige_score is important. Maybe parents with higher prestige scores encourage their children to take the certificate. So a split on Prestige_score >= 15 (midpoint of 0-28). If yes, then maybe check another feature like Type_school.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Educational_level. For example, if Educational_level is 0 (3rd_level_complete?), maybe they already have a degree, so not taking the certificate? Not sure. Hmm.

Wait, the target is whether the school leaving certificate is taken. So maybe higher educational levels might correlate with taking the certificate. Let's try to build a simple tree of depth 2.

Let me start with DVRT first. Suppose the first node is DVRT <= 60. If yes, go left; else right. Then, on the left branch, maybe check the Prestige_score. Suppose if Prestige_score >= 20, then predict 1 (taken), else 0. On the right branch (DVRT >60), maybe check Type_school. For example, if Type_school is 2 (vocational), then maybe 0, else 1. Not sure, but this is a possible structure.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Type_school. For instance, if Type_school is 2 (vocational), then they are less likely to take the certificate. Let's see:

Node 0: Type_school == 2 (vocational). If yes, then predict 0. If not, go to next node.

The next node could be Prestige_score. Suppose Prestige_score >= 15: then predict 1, else 0. But that's depth 1 and 2.

Alternatively, here's another approach. Let me think of possible splits that make sense:

Suppose the first split is on DVRT. Let's say if DVRT is above 70, then more likely to take the certificate. Suppose first node is DVRT <= 70. If yes (<=70), then maybe check Sex. For example, if Sex is male (1), then predict 0, else 1. Or something else.

Alternatively, maybe:

Root node: Educational_level. For example, if Educational_level is a certain value (like 10, which is Senior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school), maybe they are more likely to take the certificate. But that's more categorical. Since Educational_level has 11 categories, maybe splitting on a specific value.

Alternatively, since the example uses a binary split (<= threshold), maybe pick a threshold for Educational_level. But since it's categorical, perhaps splitting into groups like <5 or >=5.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to come up with a simple tree.

Let me try:

The root node is DVRT. Suppose the threshold is 65. If DVRT <= 65 (left), then next split on Prestige_score. Let's say Prestige_score <= 10 (left), predict 0; else (right), predict 1. If DVRT >65 (right branch), then check Type_school. If Type_school is 2 (vocational), predict 0, else predict 1.

Wait, but that's a depth 2 tree. The nodes list would have 3 nodes? Wait, the example has depth 2 and nodes of length 2. Because in their example, nodes[0] is first split, nodes[1] is the second split. The structure is: root (node 0), then each child has their own node (so nodes[1] for the second split). So for a depth 2 tree, there are two splits, so nodes list has 2 elements.

Wait in the example, the function has two nodes (nodes = 2*[None]). The first node is the root's condition, then the second is the next split. So the tree is depth 2 (root has two children, each of those may have their own children, but in the example, they stop there). So in the example's case, the tree is:

Root: HbA1c_level <=6.7 (node 0)
If yes, then next split is blood_glucose_level <=210 (node 1)
If no, then goes to the else, which is a leaf.

So the tree has two splits (nodes 0 and 1), and the leaves are the predictions.

Therefore, to create a similar structure for the given features, I need a tree of depth 2, with two nodes.

Let me design a tree like this:

First node (root): DVRT <= 60. 

If yes (left), then next node (second split) could be Prestige_score >= 20. 

If Prestige_score >=20 (so condition is true, node[1] = 1), then predict 1 (taken).

Else (Prestige <20), predict 0.

If the first node is no (DVRT>60), then predict 1 (taken).

Wait, but that might be too simple. Alternatively, the second split on the right branch (DVRT>60) could be on Type_school.

Alternatively, let me try:

First node (root): Type_school == 2 (vocational). 

If yes (so node[0] is True, since Type_school is 2), then predict 0 (not taken).

If no (Type_school is not 2), then next node (node1) is DVRT <= 70. 

If yes (DVRT <=70), predict 0. 

Else (DVRT>70), predict 1. 

Wait but then nodes[0] is Type_school ==2? But in the features, Type_school is encoded as 0,1,2. So the condition would be (X['Type_school'] ==2). But in the code, the nodes are stored as 1 or 0 based on whether the condition is met. So for node0's condition: if it's Type_school ==2, then nodes[0] = 1, else 0.

The prediction would then be based on that. Let me see:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [0,0]
    nodes[0] = (X['Type_school'] ==2)
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0
    else:
        nodes[1] = (X['DVRT'] <=70)
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =0
        else:
            prediction=1
    return prediction, nodes

But nodes list is length 2. However, in this structure, nodes[1] is only set when the first condition is false. So for cases where the first node is true, nodes[1] would remain 0. But that's okay, because the nodes list is just the truth values of the conditions encountered along the path. But maybe the nodes should be for all possible inner nodes regardless of path? Hmm, the example's nodes list includes all the inner nodes, even if the path didn't go through them. Wait, in the example given:

In the example, nodes[0] and nodes[1] are both set regardless. The first node is HbA1c_level <=6.7. The second is blood_glucose_level <=210. But in the code, nodes[1] is set only when the first condition is true. Wait no, in the example's code:

nodes[0] = X["HbA1c_level"] <=6.7

nodes[1] = X["blood_glucose_level"] <=210

Wait, looking at the example code again:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["HbA1c_level"] <= 6.7
    nodes[1] = X["blood_glucose_level"] <= 210
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes

Wait, so both nodes are evaluated upfront. Even if the first node is false, they still compute nodes[1]. But in the decision path, the second node is only relevant if first is true. But the nodes list includes all possible inner nodes. So the nodes list is for all the inner nodes in the tree, not just those along the path taken. So in my case, if I have a tree structure where the second node is only on the left child of the first node, then nodes[1] must be the condition for that left child's split. But the right branch (if first node is false) doesn't have a second split. So in that case, the nodes list should include all the inner nodes, so nodes[0] is the root, nodes[1] is the left child's split. The right branch doesn't have another split, so nodes[1] is not part of that path. But according to the example, nodes are set for all inner nodes regardless of path. Wait in the example, the second node (nodes[1]) is computed even if the first node is false, but in that case, nodes[1] is not used in the decision. So in the function, all nodes must be computed upfront, even if they are not on the path taken. So in my case, I must structure the decision tree so that all inner nodes are evaluated, even if their conditions are not on the path taken.

Therefore, the nodes list must have entries for every inner node in the tree. So, for a depth 2 tree, there are two inner nodes (root and one child), so the nodes list has two entries. But if the second node is only on one branch, then when the other branch is taken, nodes[1] is still evaluated but not used in the prediction.

Hmm, so the nodes list must include all inner nodes in the tree. So in my decision tree design, the second node (nodes[1]) must be part of the tree, even if it's only on one branch. So let's design a tree where both branches after the root have their own splits, but in the example, that's not the case. Wait the example's tree had the root split (nodes[0]), and then the left child split (nodes[1]), while the right branch doesn't split again. Wait in the example, after the root (nodes[0]), if it's true, then nodes[1] is checked. If nodes[0] is false, then it goes to the right branch (no further splits), so the prediction is 1. So nodes[1] is part of the tree's structure, but only applicable when nodes[0] is true. So when nodes[0] is false, nodes[1] is still computed but not used in the decision path.

Therefore, in my code, I should compute all inner nodes first, then use the conditions to decide the path. So in the code structure, all the nodes must be computed upfront, then the if-else structure uses them.

Therefore, I need to design a decision tree where each inner node (except leaves) has two children, but perhaps some splits don't split further. Wait, but for a depth 2 tree, the maximum depth is 2. So the root is depth 1, its children are depth 2. So each inner node must have two children. Wait no, maybe the tree can have some branches ending earlier. But in any case, the nodes list must have all inner nodes.

Alternatively, perhaps the decision tree is designed such that the second node is the next split for both left and right branches. For example:

Node 0 (root): DVRT <= 60. 

Node 1: If left branch (DVRT <=60), then split on Prestige_score >=20. 

If right branch (DVRT>60), then split on Type_school ==2. 

Wait but then nodes[0] is the first split, nodes[1] could be the split for the left branch, but how to represent the split for the right branch? That would require more nodes. So perhaps that's a depth 2 tree with two inner nodes (nodes[0] and nodes[1]), but nodes[1] is only part of the left path. Wait no, that would not be possible because the nodes list must have all inner nodes. Hmm, perhaps I need to think of a structure where both branches after the root have their own second split. 

Alternatively, maybe the second node is a condition that applies to both branches. Not sure. Maybe I need to think of a two-node tree where the second node is the next split regardless of the first split's outcome. 

Alternatively, perhaps the second node is a condition that is checked regardless. For example, after the first split (DVRT), the second split is on Prestige_score, but that's part of the tree structure. 

Alternatively, let me think of a different approach. Let's pick two features for the splits. Let's choose DVRT first, then Prestige_score.

So:

Root node (node0): DVRT <=60.

If yes (node0 is True):

Then second node (node1): Prestige_score >=20.

If yes (node1 is true), predict 1.

Else predict 0.

If the root is no (DVRT>60):

Then second node (node1): what? Maybe another feature like Type_school.

Wait but then node1 would be part of the right branch. But in that case, nodes[1] must represent both splits, which is not possible. So perhaps the second node must be a split that is applied after the root's decision, but on a different feature depending on the path. But in code, that would require two separate conditions for node1, which would conflict.

Alternatively, perhaps the second node is another condition that is checked regardless of the first split. 

Wait, perhaps the nodes list is just all the internal nodes in the tree. So if the tree has two splits (two internal nodes), then the nodes list has two entries. The first is the root split, the second is the next split (either left or right child of root). But in that case, the tree would have a left child that splits further, and the right child is a leaf. So nodes[1] is the left child's split.

In this case, the code would need to first compute nodes[0] and nodes[1], then use them as follows:

if nodes[0] is true (left branch), then use nodes[1] to decide between the next split.

if nodes[0] is false (right branch), then go to the leaf (no further splits).

Thus, the nodes list includes all internal nodes, even if the second node is only on the left path.

Therefore, the code would look like:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [False, False]
    nodes[0] = (X['DVRT'] <=60)
    nodes[1] = (X['Prestige_score'] >=20)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        prediction = 1  # assuming the right branch's leaf is predict 1
    return prediction, nodes

Wait but in this case, the second node's condition (nodes[1]) is only relevant when nodes[0] is true. When nodes[0] is false, nodes[1] is still computed but not used in the decision. That's okay. But for the nodes list, it's just the truth values of the conditions, regardless of whether they were used.

Therefore, this structure works. 

Alternatively, I can choose different features. Let me think of another approach. Let's say the first node is based on Type_school, and the second on DVRT.

So:

node0: Type_school ==2 (vocational school)

If yes (node0 is true), predict 0.

Else, node1: DVRT <=70

If yes (node1 true), predict 0.

Else, predict 1.

Wait, but in this case, node1 is only applicable when node0 is false. 

The nodes list would have node0 and node1. So code:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [False, False]
    nodes[0] = (X['Type_school'] ==2)
    nodes[1] = (X['DVRT'] <=70)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction =0
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =0
        else:
            prediction=1
    return prediction, nodes

Here, nodes[1] is computed even when nodes[0] is true, but in the prediction, it's only used when nodes[0] is false. 

This also works. The nodes list will have both conditions evaluated. 

Either of these structures is okay. Now I need to decide which features to use and what conditions make sense. Since the features are not explained in the problem, but in the original question, the user just provided the problem statement, which is "Now" followed by the actual question. Wait the user's original input is the problem statement starting with "Now", but in the actual content, the user provided an example with HbA1c and blood glucose levels, but in this case, the features are DVRT and Prestige_score, Type_school. Wait but in this problem, the user's question is to create a Python function similar to the example, but with different features. The user didn't specify the features, but in the current problem's context, maybe they are using DVRT (maybe a typo for "DVRT" like "DVT" or some feature name?), but perhaps they are just placeholder features. Since the user's question is to create the code for a depth 2 decision tree with two inner nodes (nodes[0] and nodes[1]), I can proceed with a plausible structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should pick features that are more likely. For example, DVRT could be "Days since last visit", and Prestige_score could be a prestige score of the hospital, and Type_school is the type of school (e.g., public/private). But since the exact features are not specified, I can make reasonable assumptions.

Let me proceed with the first structure I thought of:

Root node (node0): DVRT <=60.

If yes, then node1: Prestige_score >=20.

If both yes, predict 1.

Else, predict 0.

Else (DVRT>60), predict 1.

So the code would be:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [False, False]
    nodes[0] = (X['DVRT'] <= 60)
    nodes[1] = (X['Prestige_score'] >= 20)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        prediction = 1
    return prediction, nodes

This seems okay. Let me test this logic with some examples.

Test case 1: DVRT=50, Prestige_score=25:

nodes[0]=True, nodes[1]=True → predict 1.

Test case 2: DVRT=50, Prestige_score=15 → nodes[0]T, nodes[1]F → predict 0.

Test case3: DVRT=70 → nodes[0]F → predict 1.

Test case4: DVRT=60 (equal to 60) → nodes[0]T, nodes[1]? If Prestige is 19 → 0.

This structure works, and the nodes list includes both conditions.

Alternatively, another structure where the second node is on the other branch.

Alternatively, maybe using Type_school as the second node.

But given that the user's example used two conditions, it's better to stick with two features.

Alternatively, to make it more complex, perhaps the second node is on the right branch. But in that case, we need to have another condition. 

Wait, but in code, nodes[1] must be a condition that is computed regardless. So for example, root is DVRT <=60, and node1 is Type_school ==0.

Then:

if DVRT <=60:

then use node1's condition.

Else:

then also use node1's condition?

But that might not make sense. Alternatively, node1 is a condition that applies to the right branch. But since node1 must be a condition that is computed regardless, the code would have to compute it even when not needed. 

Alternatively, perhaps the second node is on both branches. For example:

node0: DVRT <=60

node1: Prestige_score >=20

If node0 is true:

then if node1 → 1, else 0.

If node0 is false:

then if node1 → 0, else 1.

This would make the prediction depend on both conditions on both branches.

Thus, code:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [False, False]
    nodes[0] = (X['DVRT'] <=60)
    nodes[1] = (X['Prestige_score'] >=20)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1 if nodes[1] else 0
    else:
        prediction = 0 if nodes[1] else 1
    return prediction, nodes

This way, both branches use the second node's condition, so it's a symmetric structure.

This might be better because both branches use the second condition.

Let me see test cases:

Test case1: DVRT=50 (node0 T), Prestige=25 (node1 T → predict 1).

Test case2: DVRT=50, Prestige=15 → 0.

Test case3: DVRT=70 (node0 F), Prestige=25 → node1 T → predict 0.

Test case4: DVRT=70, Prestige=15 → node1 F → predict 1.

This might be a more balanced tree.

Alternatively, the user's example had the second node only on the left branch, so maybe following that structure.

But since the user's example computed all nodes upfront, I think it's acceptable.

Therefore, I can proceed with this code structure.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the code to have the same structure as the example, where the first node is the root, and the second node is only on the left branch, with the right branch being a leaf.

In that case, the code would be like:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [False, False]
    nodes[0] = (X['DVRT'] <= 60)
    nodes[1] = (X['Prestige_score'] >= 20)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Right branch is a leaf
        
    return prediction, nodes

This is the first structure I had. It's simpler and similar to the example given. The example's code:

In the example provided by the user, the code was:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [False, False]
    nodes[0] = (X['HbA1c'] <= 8.5)
    nodes[1] = (X['blood_glucose'] <= 140)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 1
    return prediction, nodes

Which uses the same structure where the second node is only on the left branch.

Thus, following this structure, the user's desired code would follow the same pattern.

Therefore, I will proceed with the first structure I proposed.
