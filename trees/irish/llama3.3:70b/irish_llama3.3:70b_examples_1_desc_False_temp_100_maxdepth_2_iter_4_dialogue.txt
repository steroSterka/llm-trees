To build a decision tree classifier with the given features that predicts whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not, we first need to identify which feature(s) are most relevant. Since the task involves determining the completion of a school leaving certificate, features like "Educational level attained" and "Type of school" seem directly relevant because they indicate the level of education achieved or the type of educational path taken.

Given the requirement for a maximum depth of 2, we will prioritize features that can split the data into meaningful categories at each level. The decision tree should ideally use the most informative features first.

Let's construct a hypothetical decision tree based on these principles:

1. **Root Node (Depth 0): Educational level attained**
   - This feature is chosen because it directly reflects the extent of education completed, which would be highly correlated with whether a school leaving certificate was taken.
   - **Educational level attained <= 5**: This could indicate that the individual did not complete their secondary education or its equivalent, potentially suggesting they might not have taken a school leaving certificate.
     - **Left Child (Depth 1): Type of school**
       - If the type of school is "primary terminal leaver" or "vocational," it might further support the likelihood that a traditional school leaving certificate was not obtained.
         - Class: Not Taken
       - If the type of school is "secondary," there might still be a chance, depending on other factors, but given our constraints and the low educational level attained, we lean towards:
         - Class: Not Taken
   - **Educational level attained > 5**: This suggests a higher level of education completion, which increases the likelihood that a school leaving certificate was taken.
     - **Right Child (Depth 1): Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score**
       - A higher score might indicate better academic performance and thus a higher likelihood of completing and passing a school leaving certificate.
         - **Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score >= 50** (assuming 50 is an average or threshold score):
           - Class: Taken
         - **Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score < 50**:
           - Given the higher educational level but potentially lower academic performance, we might still lean towards the certificate being taken due to the initial condition of a higher educational attainment level.
             - Class: Taken

Decision Tree:
```
|--- Educational level attained <= 5
||--- Type of school == "primary terminal leaver" or "vocational"
|||--- Class: Not Taken
||--- Type of school == "secondary"
|||--- Class: Not Taken
|--- Educational level attained > 5
||--- Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score >= 50
|||--- Class: Taken
||--- Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score < 50
|||--- Class: Taken
```

Please note, this decision tree is constructed based on logical deductions rather than actual data analysis. The specific thresholds and feature choices would ideally be determined through statistical analysis or machine learning algorithms applied to a dataset containing the relevant information.

Here's how you can define a function to predict whether a school leaving certificate is taken based on the given features and decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the input features.
        - Sex: Sex of child (0 = female, 1 = male)
        - DVRT: Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
        - Educational_level: Educational level attained
        - Prestige_score: Prestige score for fathers occupation as calculated by Raftery and Hout, 1985
        - Type_school: Type of school (0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational)

    Returns:
    prediction (int): Whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not (0 = not taken, 1 = taken)
    nodes (list): A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """

    # Define the conditions for each node in the decision tree
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] > 5  # Condition at root node
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] >= 50 if nodes[0] else None  # Condition at second level, only applicable if first condition is true

    # Convert boolean values to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0)
    nodes[0] = int(nodes[0])
    if nodes[1] is not None:
        nodes[1] = int(nodes[1])

    # Make the prediction based on the conditions
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1] is not None and nodes[1]:  # If second condition is applicable and true
            prediction = 1
        else:  # Second condition either false or not applicable
            prediction = 1  # Given our tree structure, default to taken for higher educational levels
    else:
        if X["Type_school"] == 0:  # Primary terminal leaver
            prediction = 0
        elif X["Type_school"] in [1, 2]:  # Secondary or vocational terminal leaver
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes


# Example usage
input_features = {
    "Sex": 1,
    "DVRT": 55,
    "Educational_level": 8,
    "Prestige_score": 15,
    "Type_school": 1
}
prediction, nodes = predict(input_features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not (0 = not taken, 1 = taken)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Truth values of inner nodes
```

This function implements a decision tree to predict whether a school leaving certificate is taken based on educational level and Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score. The conditions for each node in the decision tree are defined within the function, which then uses these conditions to make a prediction. The truth values of the inner nodes are also returned as a list.
