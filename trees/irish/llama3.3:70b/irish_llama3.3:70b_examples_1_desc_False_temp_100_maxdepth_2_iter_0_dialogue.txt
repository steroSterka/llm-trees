To build a decision tree classifier with the given features and a maximum depth of 2 that predicts whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Target Variable**: The target variable here is whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not. For simplicity, let's denote taking the certificate as "Yes" and not taking it as "No".

2. **Feature Selection**: Since we're aiming for a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, we'll need to identify the most important features that can lead us to our target variable. Without actual data, I'll rely on general reasoning:
   - **Sex (male / female)**: While this could influence educational attainment, it might not be as directly impactful on taking a school leaving certificate compared to other factors.
   - **Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score**: This score could significantly impact the decision or ability to take a school leaving certificate, as higher scores might correlate with better educational outcomes.
   - **Educational level attained (0 to 10)**: This is likely a very important feature since it directly reflects an individual's progression through the education system. Higher levels would indicate greater success and potentially a higher likelihood of taking a school leaving certificate.
   - **Prestige score for father's occupation (0 to 28)**: Socioeconomic status, as indicated by the prestige score of the father's occupation, can influence educational opportunities and outcomes. However, its direct impact on taking a specific certificate might be less straightforward compared to educational attainment or test scores.
   - **Type of school (secondary / vocational / primary terminal leaver)**: The type of school attended could significantly affect whether an individual takes a school leaving certificate, as certain types of schools may have different requirements or pathways.

Given these considerations and without actual data to perform feature selection techniques like mutual information or recursive feature elimination, we'll proceed with a logical deduction based on the potential impact of each feature on the decision to take a school leaving certificate.

3. **Decision Tree Construction**:
   - At the first level (root), it makes sense to split based on **Educational level attained**, as this directly relates to an individual's progression in education and thus their eligibility or likelihood to take a school leaving certificate.
   - For the second level, considering we want to keep the tree simple and not exceed a depth of 2, we'll further split based on another significant factor. If **Educational level attained** is high (let's say above 5 as an arbitrary threshold), the next most logical feature to consider would be **Type of school**, as it could influence the type of certificate or educational path taken.

Thus, a simplified decision tree might look like this:

|--- Educational level attained <= 5
||--- Type of school = secondary
|||--- class: Yes (took school leaving certificate)
||--- Type of school != secondary
|||--- class: No (did not take school leaving certificate)
|--- Educational level attained > 5
||--- Type of school = vocational or primary terminal leaver
|||--- class: Yes (with the understanding that higher educational levels might include certifications from various types of schools)
||--- Type of school != vocational or primary terminal leaver
|||--- class: Yes (assuming those with high educational attainment are more likely to have taken a certificate, regardless of school type)

This decision tree is speculative and based on logical deductions without actual data analysis. In practice, the construction of such a tree would involve training a model on a dataset containing these features and the target variable (whether the school leaving certificate was taken), potentially using techniques like cross-validation to evaluate its performance and feature selection methods to identify the most predictive features.

Here's a Python function representing the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not based on a decision tree.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing features.
        - 'Sex': Sex of child (0 = female, 1 = male)
        - 'DVRT': Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
        - 'Educational_level': Educational level attained
        - 'Prestige_score': Prestige score for father's occupation
        - 'Type_school': Type of school (0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational)

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """
    # Initialize nodes as None
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0 condition: Educational level attained is greater than or equal to 5 (considered higher educational levels)
    nodes[0] = X['Educational_level'] >= 5
    
    # If the first node's condition is true, check the second node
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1 condition: Type of school is secondary terminal leaver
        nodes[1] = X['Type_school'] == 1
        prediction = 1  # Default to taking the certificate for higher educational levels and/or attending a secondary terminal leaver school
    else:
        # If the first node's condition is false, check if the type of school is vocational or primary terminal leaver
        nodes[1] = X['Type_school'] in [0, 2]
        prediction = 0  # Default to not taking the certificate for lower educational levels and/or attending a vocational or primary terminal leaver school
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]

# Example usage:
example_input = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 80,
    'Educational_level': 8,
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_input)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This decision tree considers the educational level attained and the type of school attended to predict whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not. It returns both the prediction (0 for not taking the certificate, 1 for taking it) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes (where `True` becomes 1 and `False` becomes 0).
