To build a decision tree that classifies whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not based on the provided features, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Select the Target Variable**: The target variable here is "school leaving certificate taken" (yes/no). However, since this variable isn't explicitly listed among the features, let's assume we're trying to predict it based on the other variables.

2. **Feature Selection**: We'll consider all given features for potential importance in predicting our target variable:
   - Sex
   - Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score
   - Educational level attained
   - Prestige score for father's occupation
   - Type of school

3. **Decision Tree Construction**:
   - Without explicit data or a method to determine the most important features directly from your question, we'll use general knowledge about how such factors might influence educational outcomes.
   - Typically, factors like "Educational level attained" and "Type of school" are strong predictors for whether someone takes their school leaving certificate. 
   - "Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score" could also be predictive as it reflects academic ability.

Given these considerations and without specific data to train a model, I'll propose a hypothetical decision tree based on logical deductions about how these factors might influence taking a school leaving certificate:

- **Decision Tree**:
  |--- Educational level attained <= 5
  ||--- class: Not taken (assuming lower educational attainment levels are less likely to lead to taking the certificate)
  |--- Educational level attained > 5
  ||--- Type of school == secondary
  |||--- Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score >= 50 (arbitrary threshold for passing or achieving a certain standard)
  ||||--- class: Taken
  |||--- Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score < 50
  ||||--- class: Not taken
  ||--- Type of school != secondary (vocational / primary terminal leaver)
  |||--- Educational level attained >= 8
  ||||--- class: Taken (assuming higher educational attainment in non-secondary paths could indicate a path towards taking the certificate)
  |||--- Educational level attained < 8
  ||||--- class: Not taken

This decision tree is highly speculative and based on logical deductions rather than actual data analysis. In practice, constructing an accurate decision tree would require:
- Actual data including the target variable (school leaving certificate taken or not).
- Feature selection methods to determine which variables are most predictive.
- Training a decision tree classifier using this data.

Please note, without specific data points and outcomes for these features regarding taking a school leaving certificate, any proposed decision tree is speculative.

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree based on the provided features and target variable. This function returns a single prediction (whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not) along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether the school leaving certificate is taken based on the given features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing the features 'Sex', 'DVRT', 'Educational_level', 
              'Prestige_score', and 'Type_school'.
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    
    # Initialize the nodes with None
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X['Educational_level'] <= 5  # Node: Educational level attained is low (<= 5)
    nodes[1] = X['Type_school'] == 1  # Node: Type of school is secondary_terminal_leaver
    nodes[2] = X['DVRT'] >= 50  # Node: Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score is high (>= 50)
    nodes[3] = X['Educational_level'] >= 8  # Node: Educational level attained is high (>= 8)
    nodes[4] = X['Type_school'] != 1  # Node: Type of school is not secondary_terminal_leaver
    
    # Make the prediction based on the conditions
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # If educational level is low, predict not taken
    elif nodes[1] and nodes[2]:
        prediction = 1  # If type of school is secondary and DVRT score is high, predict taken
    elif nodes[3] and (not nodes[4]):
        prediction = 1  # If educational level is high and type of school is secondary, predict taken
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Otherwise, predict not taken
    
    # Convert the boolean values to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
features = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 60,
    'Educational_level': 9,
    'Prestige_score': 20,
    'Type_school': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This function first defines the conditions for each node in the decision tree. It then makes a prediction based on these conditions and finally converts the boolean values of the nodes to integers (1 for True, 0 for False) before returning them along with the prediction. The example usage at the end shows how to use this function with a sample set of features.
