To build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 that classifies whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not, we first need to identify which features are most important for this classification. The given features are:

1. **Sex** (male / female)
2. **Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score**
3. **Educational level attained** (0 to 10)
4. **Prestige score for father's occupation** (0 to 28)
5. **Type of school** (secondary / vocational / primary terminal leaver)

Since the target variable is not explicitly provided in your question, let's assume it's "School Leaving Certificate Taken" with possible values being "Yes" or "No". We'll use a hypothetical dataset based on these features to induce a decision tree.

### Hypothetical Dataset Example

For simplicity and without actual data, we'll proceed conceptually. The decision tree algorithm works by recursively partitioning the data into subsets based on the feature that results in the largest separation between classes (in this case, "Yes" or "No" for taking the school leaving certificate).

Given the nature of the features:
- **Sex** is categorical and might influence educational attainment but isn't typically the most significant factor in decision-making about taking a school leaving certificate.
- **Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score** could be important as it reflects academic ability, potentially influencing whether one takes a school leaving certificate.
- **Educational level attained** directly relates to whether someone would take a school leaving certificate; higher levels of attainment might correlate with not needing or wanting the certificate.
- **Prestige score for father's occupation** could influence access to educational opportunities but is less directly related to taking a school leaving certificate compared to academic performance or educational level.
- **Type of school** attended has a significant impact on the likelihood of taking a school leaving certificate, as certain types of schools might not offer or require such certificates.

### Decision Tree Construction

Given these considerations and without actual data to run through an algorithm, we might construct a decision tree that looks something like this:

1. **Root Node**: Type of school
   - This is chosen because the type of school (secondary, vocational, primary terminal leaver) has a direct influence on the educational pathways available, including whether a school leaving certificate is applicable or required.

2. **First Split**:
   - **Type of school = secondary**
     - Proceed to check Educational level attained.
   - **Type of school ≠ secondary** (vocational or primary terminal leaver)
     - May directly influence the likelihood of taking a school leaving certificate, potentially leading to different classifications based on these categories.

3. **Second Split (for Type of school = secondary)**:
   - **Educational level attained ≤ 5**
     - Class: Likely to take school leaving certificate
   - **Educational level attained > 5**
     - Class: Less likely or not taking school leaving certificate

This simplified example illustrates how one might construct a decision tree based on the given features. The actual construction would depend on analyzing a dataset with these variables and using a decision tree algorithm (like CART, C4.5, etc.) to determine the splits that best separate the classes.

### Python Example Using Scikit-learn

If you had a DataFrame `df` with your data, where `school_leaving_certificate` is your target variable, you could use scikit-learn in Python like this:

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = df[['sex', 'Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score', 'Educational level attained', 
        'Prestige score for father\'s occupation', 'Type of school']]
y = df['school_leaving_certificate']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# To visualize the tree
from sklearn.tree import plot_tree
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))
plot_tree(clf, feature_names=X.columns, class_names=y.unique(), filled=True)
plt.show()
```

This code snippet would train a decision tree classifier on your data with a maximum depth of 2 and then visualize the resulting tree.

Here is a Python function that implements the decision tree based on the provided features and target variable. The function takes in a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple where the first element is the predicted value (0 or 1) indicating whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not, and the second element is a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not based on the given features.
    
    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. The keys should match the following:
            - 'Sex'
            - 'DVRT'
            - 'Educational_level'
            - 'Prestige_score'
            - 'Type_school'
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple where the first element is the predicted value (0 or 1) and the second element is a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    
    # Initialize the nodes list with None values
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: Check if the type of school is secondary_terminal_leaver (Type_school == 1)
    nodes[0] = X['Type_school'] == 1
    
    # If the first node condition is true, proceed to check the second node
    if nodes[0]:
        # Second node: Check if the educational level attained is greater than or equal to Senior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school (Educational_level >= 8)
        nodes[1] = X['Educational_level'] >= 8
        
        # If both conditions are true, predict that the school leaving certificate is not taken
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            # If only the first condition is true, predict that the school leaving certificate is taken
            prediction = 1
    else:
        # If the first node condition is false, proceed to a different path
        # For simplicity and without loss of generality, we'll consider another condition
        nodes[1] = X['DVRT'] >= 50
        
        # Predict based on this alternative path
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    
    # Convert boolean values in the nodes list to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
X = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 55,
    'Educational_level': 9,
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

```

This code implements a decision tree with two levels of depth. The first level checks the type of school, and if it's `secondary_terminal_leaver`, it proceeds to check the educational level attained in the second level. If the conditions are met, it predicts whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not based on these factors.

Please note that this implementation assumes certain thresholds for the conditions (e.g., `DVRT >= 50`), which might need to be adjusted according to the actual data distribution and requirements of your specific problem. Additionally, the example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a sample input dictionary `X`.
