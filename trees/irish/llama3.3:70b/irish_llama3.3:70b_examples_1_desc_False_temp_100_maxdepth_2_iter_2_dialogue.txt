To build a decision tree classifier with the given features and a maximum depth of 2 that predicts whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not, we first need to understand the features provided:

1. **Sex** (male/female)
2. **Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score**
3. **Educational level attained** (0 to 10)
4. **Prestige score for father's occupation** (0 to 28)
5. **Type of school** (secondary/vocational/primary terminal leaver)

Since we're aiming for a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, we will have one main feature dividing the dataset at the root and then secondary features further dividing each branch.

Given the nature of the problem, we are trying to predict whether a "school leaving certificate is taken or not." The features most directly related to educational attainment and outcomes would be more relevant. Thus, **Educational level attained** seems like a strong candidate for the first split because it directly relates to educational achievement, which could influence or reflect the taking of a school leaving certificate.

For simplicity, let's assume that higher values in "Educational level attained" are associated with taking the school leaving certificate (as it indicates further progression in education), and lower values might indicate otherwise.

Here is a simplified decision tree based on these assumptions:

- **Root Node:** Educational level attained
    - If **Educational level attained <= 5**:
        - This could indicate a lower likelihood of taking a school leaving certificate, given the educational progression.
        - Further split: Type of school
            - If **Type of school == secondary**:
                - Class: School Leaving Certificate Taken (assuming those in secondary schools have more opportunities or are on a path to take such certificates)
            - Else:
                - Class: School Leaving Certificate Not Taken
    - If **Educational level attained > 5**:
        - This suggests a higher educational attainment, which could imply taking the school leaving certificate.
        - Further split: Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score
            - If **Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score >= median score** (assuming a median score is available or can be calculated):
                - Class: School Leaving Certificate Taken (higher scores might correlate with better educational outcomes)
            - Else:
                - Class: School Leaving Certificate Not Taken

This decision tree uses "Educational level attained" as the primary feature for splitting, followed by secondary splits based on "Type of school" and "Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score," which seem relevant to the outcome. The tree's structure is speculative without actual data but illustrates how one might approach building such a classifier with given features and constraints.

Please note, in real-world scenarios:
- You would use actual data to train the model.
- Feature selection might involve evaluating feature importance through methods like mutual information or recursive feature elimination.
- Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., the maximum depth of the tree) could be performed using techniques like cross-validation.

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not based on the provided features.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not based on the given features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing the features.
        - 'Sex': Sex of child (0 = female, 1 = male)
        - 'DVRT': Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
        - 'Educational_level': Educational level attained (3rd_level_complete=0, 3rd_level_incomplete=1, ?=2, Junior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school=3, Junior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school=4, Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school=5, Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-vocational_school=6, Primary_terminal_leaver=7, Senior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school=8, Senior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school=9, Senior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school=10)
        - 'Prestige_score': Prestige score for fathers occupation as calculated by Raftery and Hout, 1985 (0 to 28)
        - 'Type_school': Type of school (0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational)
    
    Returns:
    prediction (int): Prediction of whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not (0 = not taken, 1 = taken).
    nodes (list): List representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """
    
    # Initialize nodes list with None values
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Educational level attained <= 5
    nodes[0] = X['Educational_level'] <= 5
    
    # Node 1: Type of school == secondary_terminal_leaver (1) if Educational level attained <= 5, 
    #          DVRT >= median score otherwise
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X['Type_school'] == 1
    else:
        # Assuming a median DVRT score of 50 for illustration purposes
        nodes[1] = X['DVRT'] >= 50
    
    # Prediction based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    
    # Convert boolean values in nodes to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
features = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 60,
    'Educational_level': 6,
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)

```

This function implements the decision tree logic based on the provided features and returns a prediction along with the truth values of the inner nodes. Note that the median DVRT score used in the example is arbitrary and should be replaced with the actual median score from your dataset for accurate predictions.
