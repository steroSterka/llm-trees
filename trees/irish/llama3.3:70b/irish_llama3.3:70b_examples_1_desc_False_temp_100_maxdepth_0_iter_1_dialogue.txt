To build a decision tree classifier based on the given features that predicts whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not, we'll follow a similar structure as your example. Since we don't have actual data to train the model and determine the importance of each feature, I'll use logical reasoning based on common educational and sociological factors.

Given Features:
1. sex (male / female)
2. Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score
3. Educational level attained (0 to 10)
4. Prestige score for father's occupation (0 to 28)
5. Type of school (secondary / vocational / primary terminal leaver)

Let's construct a decision tree that logically classifies whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not, keeping in mind the potential influence of each feature on educational outcomes.

Decision Tree:
|--- Educational level attained <= 6
||--- class: Not Taken (Assuming lower educational attainment might correlate with not taking the school leaving certificate)
|--- Educational level attained > 6
||--- Type of school == secondary
|||--- class: Taken (Secondary schools typically prepare students for such certificates)
||--- Type of school != secondary
||||--- Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score >= 50 (Assuming a moderate to high score, the exact threshold may vary based on actual data)
|||||--- class: Taken
||||--- Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score < 50
|||||--- Prestige score for father's occupation <= 10
||||||--- class: Not Taken (Lower prestige scores might indicate less socio-economic support for education)
|||||--- Prestige score for father's occupation > 10
||||||--- class: Taken

This decision tree makes the following assumptions based on logical reasoning:
- Lower educational attainment levels are less likely to result in taking a school leaving certificate.
- Secondary schools are more likely to prepare students for such certificates compared to vocational or primary terminal leaver schools.
- A moderate to high Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score may indicate better academic preparedness and thus a higher likelihood of taking the certificate.
- The prestige score of the father's occupation is used as a proxy for socio-economic status, with higher scores potentially indicating more support for education.

Please note, without actual data and analysis (such as feature importance from a random forest or similar), this tree is speculative. Real-world application would require training a model on a dataset to accurately determine feature importance and optimal decision thresholds.

Based on the provided features and target variable, here's a Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not based on given features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the features.
            - 'Sex': Sex of child (0 = female, 1 = male)
            - 'DVRT': Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
            - 'Educational_level': Educational level attained (range: 0-10)
            - 'Prestige_score': Prestige score for father's occupation (range: 0-28)
            - 'Type_school': Type of school (0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational)

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """

    # Initialize nodes with None
    nodes = 5 * [None]

    # Node 0: Educational level attained <= 6
    nodes[0] = X['Educational_level'] <= 6

    # Node 1: Type of school == secondary_terminal_leaver (1)
    nodes[1] = X['Type_school'] == 1

    # Node 2: DVRT score >= 50 (assuming a moderate to high score threshold)
    nodes[2] = X['DVRT'] >= 50

    # Node 3: Prestige score for father's occupation > 10
    nodes[3] = X['Prestige_score'] > 10

    # Node 4: Educational level attained > 6 and Type of school == secondary_terminal_leaver (1)
    nodes[4] = not nodes[0] and nodes[1]

    # Prediction based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Not taken
    elif nodes[4]:
        prediction = 1  # Taken
    elif nodes[2] and nodes[3]:
        prediction = 1  # Taken
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Not taken

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]

# Example usage:
features = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 60,
    'Educational_level': 8,
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)

```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features as input and returns a tuple with the predicted target variable value (0 or 1) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.

Note: The threshold values used in the decision tree (e.g., DVRT score >= 50, Prestige score > 10) are assumptions based on general knowledge and may need to be adjusted according to actual data analysis.
