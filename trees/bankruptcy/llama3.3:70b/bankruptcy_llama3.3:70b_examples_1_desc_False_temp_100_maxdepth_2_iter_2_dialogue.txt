To build a decision tree classifier that determines whether a company went bankrupt or not based on the given financial features, we first need to understand what each feature represents and how it might relate to bankruptcy. The features are:

1. **Working Capital/Total Assets**: This ratio indicates the proportion of total assets that is comprised of working capital. A higher ratio suggests a healthier liquidity position.

2. **Retained Earnings/Total Assets**: This shows the portion of total assets that is financed by retained earnings, indicating profitability and reinvestment in the company.

3. **Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT)/Total Assets**: Known as return on assets (ROA), this metric measures a company's profitability from its operations, ignoring the effects of financing and tax obligations.

4. **Sales/Total Assets**: This ratio indicates asset efficiency or how well a company is using its assets to generate sales.

5. **Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities**: This ratio shows the relationship between equity (the amount owned by shareholders) and liabilities (the amount owed to creditors), indicating leverage and financial health.

Given these features, we want to construct a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 that classifies companies as either bankrupt or not. The most critical aspect is determining which features are most indicative of bankruptcy risk based on their potential impact on a company's financial stability and viability.

Let's consider the importance of each feature in predicting bankruptcy:

- **Working Capital/Total Assets** and **Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities** are crucial because they directly reflect a company's liquidity and solvency.
- **Retained Earnings/Total Assets** indicates past profitability but might not be as immediate a predictor of current financial distress compared to working capital or leverage ratios.
- **EBIT/Total Assets** measures operational efficiency, which is vital for long-term sustainability.
- **Sales/Total Assets** reflects how effectively assets are being used, with lower values potentially indicating inefficiency.

Without specific data on these features for companies that have and have not gone bankrupt, we must rely on general financial principles to guide our decision tree construction. Here's a hypothetical decision tree based on the assumption that liquidity (working capital) and leverage (equity vs. liabilities) are primary indicators of bankruptcy risk:

```
|--- Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.20
||--- class: Bankrupt (Insufficient liquidity)
|--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.20
    |--- Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities <= 1.00
    ||--- class: Bankrupt (High leverage, potentially insolvent)
    |--- Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities > 1.00
    ||--- class: Not Bankrupt (Sufficient equity to cover liabilities)
```

This decision tree uses two features:
- **Working Capital/Total Assets** as the first split because liquidity issues can quickly lead to bankruptcy.
- **Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities** as the second level of splits for companies with sufficient working capital, recognizing that high leverage (low equity relative to liabilities) increases the risk of insolvency.

Please note, this is a simplified example and real-world applications would require:
1. Actual data on bankrupt and non-bankrupt companies.
2. Feature selection based on statistical analysis or domain knowledge.
3. Potential use of more features or different thresholds.
4. Model validation to ensure the tree's predictive accuracy.

The thresholds (0.20 for working capital ratio and 1.00 for equity-to-liabilities ratio) are arbitrary in this example and would need adjustment based on empirical data and possibly financial sector norms.

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting whether a company will go bankrupt or not based on the provided financial features. This function takes in a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple where the first element is the predicted target variable (0 for no bankruptcy, 1 for bankruptcy) and the second element is a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a company will go bankrupt based on financial features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. The keys are:
        - 'WC/TA': Working Capital/Total Assets
        - 'RE/TA': Retained Earnings/Total Assets
        - 'EBIT/TA': Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
        - 'S/TA': Sales/Total Assets
        - 'BVE/BVL': Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the predicted target variable (0 for no bankruptcy, 1 for bankruptcy)
           and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """
    
    # Initialize nodes with None
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if Working Capital/Total Assets is less than or equal to 0.20
    nodes[0] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.20
    
    # Node 1: Check if Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities is less than or equal to 1.00
    nodes[1] = X['BVE/BVL'] <= 1.00
    
    # Prediction based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Bankrupt: Insufficient liquidity
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt: High leverage, potentially insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt: Sufficient equity to cover liabilities
    
    # Convert boolean values to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
X = {
    'WC/TA': 0.15,
    'RE/TA': 0.30,
    'EBIT/TA': 0.10,
    'S/TA': 2.50,
    'BVE/BVL': 0.80
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)

```

This code defines a function `predict` that takes in a dictionary `X` with financial feature values and returns the predicted target variable along with the truth values of the inner nodes as integers (1 for True, 0 for False). The example usage demonstrates how to call this function with a sample set of feature values.
