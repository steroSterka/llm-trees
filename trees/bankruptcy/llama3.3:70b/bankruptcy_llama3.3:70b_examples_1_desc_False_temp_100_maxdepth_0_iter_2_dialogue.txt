To induce a decision tree classifier for determining whether a company went bankrupt or not based on the provided financial features, we'll follow a logical approach to feature selection and node creation. The actual process would involve using algorithms like ID3 or C4.5, but given the constraints of this format, I will apply logical reasoning to construct a simplified decision tree.

Given Features:
1. Working Capital/Total Assets
2. Retained Earnings/Total Assets
3. Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT)/Total Assets
4. Sales/Total Assets
5. Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities

The Decision Tree:

Let's start by considering the most critical indicators of a company's financial health that could lead to bankruptcy:
- **Working Capital/Total Assets** reflects a company's liquidity and ability to meet short-term obligations.
- **Retained Earnings/Total Assets** indicates profitability and reinvestment in the business.
- **EBIT/Total Assets** shows operational efficiency without considering financing decisions.
- **Sales/Total Assets** can indicate asset utilization efficiency.
- **Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities** reflects a company's solvency and leverage.

Given these, we might prioritize features based on immediate indicators of financial distress:
1. A company with negative or very low **Working Capital/Total Assets** is likely in financial distress because it cannot meet its short-term obligations.
2. Negative **Retained Earnings/Total Assets** suggests cumulative losses, impacting the ability to invest in operations and repay debts.

Decision Tree Construction:

|--- Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0
||--- class: Bankrupt (Immediate liquidity issues suggest a high likelihood of bankruptcy)
|--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0
||--- Retained Earnings/Total Assets <= 0
|||--- class: Bankrupt (Cumulative losses indicate significant financial distress)
||--- Retained Earnings/Total Assets > 0
|||--- Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities <= 1
||||--- class: Bankrupt (High leverage with more liabilities than equity is risky)
|||--- Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities > 1
||||--- class: Not Bankrupt (Healthy equity position relative to liabilities)

This simplified tree uses the most immediate indicators of financial health and distress. In practice, constructing an optimal decision tree would involve evaluating each feature's information gain or Gini impurity reduction at each node, which requires actual data and iterative calculations not specified here.

Note: This is a conceptual approach based on the features provided and may not accurately predict bankruptcy without considering other factors, industry benchmarks, and more sophisticated machine learning techniques applied to real datasets.

Here's the Python function based on the provided decision tree structure and feature descriptions:

```python
def predict_bankruptcy(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether a company will go bankrupt or not based on financial features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
        - 'WC/TA': Working Capital/Total Assets
        - 'RE/TA': Retained Earnings/Total Assets
        - 'EBIT/TA': Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
        - 'S/TA': Sales/Total Assets
        - 'BVE/BVL': Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the predicted target variable (0 = no, 1 = yes) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """

    # Initialize nodes with None
    nodes = 4 * [None]

    # Node 0: Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0
    nodes[0] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0

    # Node 1: Retained Earnings/Total Assets <= 0 (only if Node 0 is False)
    if not nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X['RE/TA'] <= 0
    else:
        nodes[1] = None

    # Node 2: Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities <= 1 (only if Nodes 0 and 1 are False)
    if not nodes[0] and not nodes[1]:
        nodes[2] = X['BVE/BVL'] <= 1
    else:
        nodes[2] = None

    # Node 3: Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets (not used in this simplified decision tree)
    nodes[3] = None

    # Predict the target variable based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Bankrupt (Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0)
    elif nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1  # Bankrupt (Retained Earnings/Total Assets <= 0)
    elif nodes[2]:
        prediction = 1  # Bankrupt (Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities <= 1)
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    # Convert boolean nodes to integers (1 for True, 0 for False) and handle None values
    node_values = [int(node) if node is not None else -1 for node in nodes]

    return prediction, node_values


# Example usage:
features = {
    'WC/TA': -0.5,
    'RE/TA': 0.2,
    'EBIT/TA': 0.1,
    'S/TA': 0.8,
    'BVE/BVL': 0.6
}

prediction, node_values = predict_bankruptcy(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Node Values: {node_values}")

```

In this function, we first evaluate the conditions at each node and store the results in a list. Then, based on these conditions, we predict whether the company will go bankrupt or not. Finally, we return the predicted target variable along with the truth values of the inner nodes.

Note that the `nodes` list contains `-1` for unused nodes (Node 3) to indicate that they are not part of the decision-making process in this simplified tree.
