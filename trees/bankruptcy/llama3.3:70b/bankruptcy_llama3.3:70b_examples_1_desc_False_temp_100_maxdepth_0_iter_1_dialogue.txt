To build a decision tree classifier for determining whether a company went bankrupt or not based on the given financial features, we need to follow a process similar to what you've described with the Iris dataset example. However, without actual data (including class labels indicating bankruptcy or not), I'll create a hypothetical decision tree based on general principles of how these financial metrics might relate to bankruptcy risk.

Given Features:
1. Working Capital/Total Assets
2. Retained Earnings/Total Assets
3. Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets (EBIT/TA)
4. Sales/Total Assets
5. Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities

Decision Tree:

|--- Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.20
||--- class: Bankrupt (indicating companies with low working capital to total assets ratio are at higher risk of bankruptcy)
|--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.20
||--- Retained Earnings/Total Assets <= -0.50
|||--- class: Bankrupt (suggesting that significant accumulated losses increase the likelihood of bankruptcy)
||--- Retained Earnings/Total Assets > -0.50
|||--- EBIT/TA <= 0.05
||||--- class: Bankrupt (low profitability can indicate struggles and potential for bankruptcy)
|||--- EBIT/TA > 0.05
||||--- Sales/Total Assets <= 1.00
|||||--- class: Not Bankrupt (stable or growing sales relative to assets suggest financial health)
||||--- Sales/Total Assets > 1.00
|||||--- Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities <= 1.50
||||||--- class: Bankrupt (high leverage and potentially unsustainable debt levels increase bankruptcy risk)
|||||--- Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities > 1.50
||||||--- class: Not Bankrupt (healthy equity to liability ratio indicates lower bankruptcy risk)

This decision tree is highly hypothetical and based on simplified assumptions about how financial metrics relate to bankruptcy risk:
- Low working capital relative to total assets might indicate liquidity issues.
- Negative retained earnings or significant accumulated losses suggest a company's long-term viability could be at risk.
- Low EBIT/TA ratios can signal profitability problems, which might lead to bankruptcy if not addressed.
- Sales relative to total assets can indicate the efficiency of asset use and revenue generation capability.
- A low book value of equity compared to liabilities (high leverage) increases the risk of insolvency.

Please note, in practice:
1. **Actual Data Analysis**: You would need real data to train such a model accurately.
2. **Feature Selection**: Importance of features can vary; some might not contribute significantly to the classification decision.
3. **Thresholds**: The thresholds used (e.g., 0.20 for Working Capital/Total Assets) are arbitrary and should be determined based on empirical evidence from your dataset or domain knowledge.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Any model, including a decision tree classifier, needs to be evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., ideally through cross-validation.

This example aims to illustrate how one might construct a simple decision tree for bankruptcy prediction based on financial features but should not be used without careful consideration of the specific context and data involved.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting whether a company went bankrupt or not based on the given financial features:

```python
def predict_bankruptcy(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a company went bankrupt or not based on its financial features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing the financial features of the company.
        - 'WC/TA': Working Capital/Total Assets
        - 'RE/TA': Retained Earnings/Total Assets
        - 'EBIT/TA': Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
        - 'S/TA': Sales/Total Assets
        - 'BVE/BVL': Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities
    
    Returns:
    prediction (int): 0 if the company did not go bankrupt, 1 if it went bankrupt.
    nodes (list): List representing the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.
    """
    
    # Initialize the list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = [None] * 5
    
    # Node 0: Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.20
    nodes[0] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.20
    
    # If node 0 is true, predict bankruptcy
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
        return prediction, [int(nodes[0]), 0, 0, 0, 0]
    
    # Node 1: Retained Earnings/Total Assets <= -0.50
    nodes[1] = X['RE/TA'] <= -0.50
    
    # If node 1 is true, predict bankruptcy
    if nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1
        return prediction, [int(nodes[0]), int(nodes[1]), 0, 0, 0]
    
    # Node 2: Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets <= 0.05
    nodes[2] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05
    
    # If node 2 is true, predict bankruptcy
    if nodes[2]:
        prediction = 1
        return prediction, [int(nodes[0]), int(nodes[1]), int(nodes[2]), 0, 0]
    
    # Node 3: Sales/Total Assets <= 1.00
    nodes[3] = X['S/TA'] <= 1.00
    
    # If node 3 is true, predict not bankrupt
    if nodes[3]:
        prediction = 0
        return prediction, [int(nodes[0]), int(nodes[1]), int(nodes[2]), int(nodes[3]), 0]
    
    # Node 4: Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities <= 1.50
    nodes[4] = X['BVE/BVL'] <= 1.50
    
    # If node 4 is true, predict bankruptcy
    if nodes[4]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 0
    
    return prediction, [int(nodes[0]), int(nodes[1]), int(nodes[2]), int(nodes[3]), int(nodes[4])]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the financial features of a company as input and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the predicted outcome (0 for not bankrupt, 1 for bankrupt), and the second element is a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.

The thresholds used in the decision tree are based on general principles of financial analysis and may need to be adjusted based on the specific dataset being used. The function assumes that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required features with their correct keys.

You can use this function by creating a dictionary with the financial features of a company and passing it as an argument, like this:

```python
company_features = {
    'WC/TA': 0.15,
    'RE/TA': -0.30,
    'EBIT/TA': 0.03,
    'S/TA': 0.80,
    'BVE/BVL': 1.20
}

prediction, nodes = predict_bankruptcy(company_features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```
