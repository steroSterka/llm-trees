To build a decision tree classifier for determining whether a company went bankrupt or not using the provided financial features, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Feature Selection**: Identify the most important features that contribute significantly to the classification.
2. **Decision Tree Construction**: Construct the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2.

Given the nature of the problem and without actual data, I'll create a hypothetical decision tree based on common financial analysis principles. The features provided are:

- Working Capital/Total Assets
- Retained Earnings/Total Assets
- Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT)/Total Assets
- Sales/Total Assets
- Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities

A company's likelihood of going bankrupt can often be assessed by its liquidity, profitability, and leverage. Thus, features like Working Capital/Total Assets (liquidity), EBIT/Total Assets (profitability), and Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities (leverage) are crucial.

Here's a simplified decision tree with a maximum depth of 2:

- **Root Node**: Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities <= 1.0
  - **Left Child**: If true, the company has more liabilities than equity, indicating potential insolvency.
    - **Decision**: Bankrupt
  - **Right Child**: If false, proceed to assess profitability and liquidity.

- **Right Child of Root (Intermediate Node)**: EBIT/Total Assets <= 0.05
  - **Left Grandchild**: If true, the company's profitability is low, which could indicate difficulties in meeting financial obligations.
    - **Decision**: Bankrupt
  - **Right Grandchild**: If false, the company has reasonable profitability, suggesting lower risk of bankruptcy.
    - **Decision**: Not Bankrupt

This decision tree uses two key features:
1. **Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities** as a primary indicator of solvency and leverage.
2. **EBIT/Total Assets** as a secondary indicator of profitability.

**Decision Tree Summary:**
```
|--- Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities <= 1.0
||--- class: Bankrupt
|--- Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities > 1.0
||--- EBIT/Total Assets <= 0.05
|||--- class: Bankrupt
||--- EBIT/Total Assets > 0.05
|||--- class: Not Bankrupt
```

This is a simplified example and actual decision tree construction would benefit from analysis of real data, potentially incorporating all the provided features in a more nuanced manner, and could involve techniques such as cross-validation to improve predictive accuracy.

Here is the decision tree function in Python based on the provided financial features:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a company went bankrupt or not based on its financial features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the financial features of the company.
              The keys should include 'WC/TA', 'RE/TA', 'EBIT/TA', 'S/TA', 'BVE/BVL'.

    Returns:
    prediction (int): 0 if the company did not go bankrupt, 1 if it went bankrupt.
    nodes (list): A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """
    # Initialize the nodes list with None
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Node 0: Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities <= 1.0
    nodes[0] = X['BVE/BVL'] <= 1.0

    # If the company has more liabilities than equity, proceed to Node 1
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: EBIT/Total Assets <= 0.05
        nodes[1] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05
        # If both conditions are true, predict the company went bankrupt
        prediction = 1
    else:
        # If the company has more equity than liabilities, predict it did not go bankrupt
        nodes[1] = False  # This node is not relevant in this case
        prediction = 0

    # Convert boolean values to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes


# Example usage:
financial_features = {
    'WC/TA': 0.2,
    'RE/TA': 0.3,
    'EBIT/TA': 0.04,
    'S/TA': 0.5,
    'BVE/BVL': 0.8
}

prediction, nodes = predict(financial_features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)

```

This function first checks if the Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities is less than or equal to 1.0. If this condition is true, it proceeds to check the EBIT/Total Assets. If both conditions are true, it predicts that the company went bankrupt; otherwise, it predicts that the company did not go bankrupt.

The function returns a prediction (0 for not bankrupt, 1 for bankrupt) and a list of integers representing the truth values of the inner nodes (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise).
