To build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 for predicting whether a company went bankrupt or not based on the provided financial features, we first need to understand what each feature represents and how it might relate to bankruptcy. The features given are:

1. **Working Capital/Total Assets**: This ratio indicates the liquidity of a company. A higher ratio suggests that a company has enough short-term assets to cover its short-term liabilities, which is generally seen as positive.

2. **Retained Earnings/Total Assets**: This shows the proportion of total assets that are financed by retained earnings. Higher ratios might indicate more stable and profitable companies.

3. **Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT)/Total Assets**: This measures a company's profitability before considering its financial structure and tax environment. A higher ratio indicates better profitability from operations.

4. **Sales/Total Assets**: This asset turnover ratio shows how efficiently a company is using its assets to generate sales. Higher ratios are generally positive, indicating efficient use of assets.

5. **Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities**: This ratio compares the book value of equity ( shareholders' funds) with the book value of liabilities. A higher ratio indicates that a company has more equity than debt, which is typically seen as less risky and more favorable.

Given these features, we want to construct a decision tree that predicts bankruptcy with a maximum depth of 2. This means our tree will have one primary split (root node) and up to two secondary splits (child nodes). The choice of the feature for each split should ideally be based on the importance or information gain of the features regarding predicting bankruptcy.

Without actual data, we'll make an educated guess on how a decision tree might look based on common financial analysis principles:

- At the root node, **Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities** could be a critical factor because it directly compares equity (a company's net worth) to liabilities. A low ratio here might indicate significant debt relative to equity, which is often associated with higher bankruptcy risk.

- For companies with **Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities <= 1**, indicating more liabilities than equity, we might then consider **Working Capital/Total Assets** as the next factor. Companies with lower working capital ratios may struggle to meet short-term obligations, increasing the likelihood of bankruptcy.

Here's a hypothetical decision tree:

|--- Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities <= 1
||--- Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.2
|||--- class: Bankrupt
||--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.2
|||--- class: Not Bankrupt
|--- Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities > 1
||--- Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT)/Total Assets <= 0.05
|||--- class: Bankrupt
||--- Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT)/Total Assets > 0.05
|||--- class: Not Bankrupt

This decision tree is highly speculative without actual data or training. In practice, you would use a dataset of companies with known bankruptcy outcomes to train a decision tree classifier, which would automatically select the most informative features for splits based on metrics like Gini impurity or information gain. The thresholds and feature choices would be optimized during the training process to maximize predictive accuracy.

Here's how you can format the decision tree as a Python function based on the provided features and target variable. This function takes in a dictionary `X` containing the feature values for a company and returns a tuple where the first element is the predicted outcome (0 = no bankruptcy, 1 = yes bankruptcy) and the second element is a list of truth values representing the inner nodes of the decision tree.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a company will go bankrupt based on its financial features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing the feature values for a company.
             Keys should include 'WC/TA', 'RE/TA', 'EBIT/TA', 'S/TA', 'BVE/BVL'.
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple where the first element is the predicted outcome (0 = no bankruptcy, 1 = yes bankruptcy)
           and the second element is a list of truth values representing the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    # Initialize nodes with None
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Condition for Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities <= 1
    nodes[0] = X['BVE/BVL'] <= 1
    
    # Node 1: Condition for Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.2 (for companies with BVE/BVL <= 1)
    #         or EBIT/TA <= 0.05 (for companies with BVE/BVL > 1)
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.2
    else:
        nodes[1] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05
    
    # Prediction based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    
    # Convert boolean values in nodes to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
company_features = {
    'WC/TA': 0.15,
    'RE/TA': 0.2,
    'EBIT/TA': 0.03,
    'S/TA': 1.5,
    'BVE/BVL': 0.8
}

prediction, nodes = predict(company_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Inner Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This code defines a function `predict` that takes in a dictionary of financial features for a company and predicts whether the company will go bankrupt based on a decision tree with two levels. The decision tree first checks if the Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities is less than or equal to 1, and then applies different conditions based on this initial check. The function returns both the predicted outcome and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.
