To build a decision tree that classifies whether a company went bankrupt or not based on the given financial features, we will use these features:

1. Working Capital/Total Assets
2. Retained Earnings/Total Assets
3. Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets (EBIT/TA)
4. Sales/Total Assets
5. Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities

Given the nature of your request, I'll simulate a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 using these features for illustrative purposes. Note that in real-world scenarios, we would use actual data and machine learning algorithms (like those found in Python's scikit-learn library) to determine feature importance and build the tree.

For this example, let's assume after analyzing the data:

- The most important feature is `Working Capital/Total Assets`, as it directly impacts a company's liquidity and ability to meet its short-term obligations.
- The second most important feature is `Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets (EBIT/TA)`, which reflects a company's profitability before financial leverage and tax considerations.

Given this, our decision tree might look like this:

|--- Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.20
    |--- class: Bankrupt (assuming low working capital indicates potential insolvency)
|--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.20
    |--- EBIT/TA <= 0.05
        |--- class: Bankrupt (indicating the company is not profitable enough to sustain operations)
    |--- EBIT/TA > 0.05
        |--- class: Not Bankrupt (suggesting sufficient profitability and working capital to avoid bankruptcy)

Please note, this is a highly simplified example and actual decision trees would be constructed based on statistical analysis of real data, potentially incorporating all the provided features in various combinations at different levels of the tree.

Here's how you might implement this in Python using scikit-learn for a more accurate model:

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'df' is your DataFrame with features and target variable 'bankrupt'
X = df[['Working Capital/Total Assets', 'Retained Earnings/Total Assets', 
        'Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets', 'Sales/Total Assets', 
        'Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities']]
y = df['bankrupt']

# Split your data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the classifier with a maximum depth of 2
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Use the model to make predictions on the test set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
```

This example illustrates how to approach building a decision tree classifier in Python. Remember, feature selection and importance can significantly affect your model's performance, so consider techniques like cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning for more robust results.

Here's a Python function representing the decision tree for predicting whether a company went bankrupt or not based on financial features. This example uses a maximum depth of 2 and assumes meaningful threshold values.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a company went bankrupt or not based on its financial features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing the company's financial features.
        - 'WC/TA': Working Capital/Total Assets
        - 'RE/TA': Retained Earnings/Total Assets
        - 'EBIT/TA': Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
        - 'S/TA': Sales/Total Assets
        - 'BVE/BVL': Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 = no, 1 = yes) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    
    # Initialize nodes with None
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0 condition: Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.20
    nodes[0] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.20
    
    # Node 1 condition (if node 0 is False): EBIT/TA <= 0.05
    nodes[1] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05 if not nodes[0] else None
    
    # Make prediction based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Company likely went bankrupt due to low working capital
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Company likely went bankrupt despite sufficient working capital, but not enough profitability
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Company did not go bankrupt
    
    # Replace None with 0 in nodes list for consistency
    nodes = [int(node) if node is not None else 0 for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X = {
    'WC/TA': 0.15,
    'RE/TA': -0.05,
    'EBIT/TA': 0.03,
    'S/TA': 1.20,
    'BVE/BVL': 0.80
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # 1 if the company went bankrupt, 0 otherwise
print("Inner node truth values:", nodes)
```

This function uses a decision tree with two inner nodes to predict whether a company went bankrupt based on its financial features. The first node checks if the working capital to total assets ratio (`WC/TA`) is less than or equal to 0.20, indicating potential insolvency. If this condition is true, the function predicts that the company went bankrupt.

If the `WC/TA` ratio is greater than 0.20, the second node checks if the earnings before interest and tax to total assets ratio (`EBIT/TA`) is less than or equal to 0.05. This indicates low profitability, which can also contribute to bankruptcy. If this condition is true, the function again predicts that the company went bankrupt.

Finally, if neither of these conditions is met, the function predicts that the company did not go bankrupt. The truth values of the inner nodes are returned along with the prediction for further analysis or debugging purposes.
