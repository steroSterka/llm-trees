Alright, so the user wants me to build a decision tree classifier using some financial features to predict if a company went bankrupt or not. They provided an example with iris dataset features and a decision tree based on petal width. Now, they've given me five new features related to a company's finances.

First, I need to understand what each feature represents. Let me list them out:

1. **Working Capital/Total Assets**: This ratio indicates the liquidity available to meet obligations. A higher value might mean the company has more liquid assets relative to total assets, which could be a good sign.

2. **Retained Earnings/Total Assets**: Retained earnings show profits reinvested in the company. Higher retained earnings could indicate stability and profitability, but if it's too high, maybe they're not distributing dividends.

3. **Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT)/Total Assets**: This measures profitability before interest and taxes. A higher ratio suggests better profitability.

4. **Sales/Total Assets**: This is the asset turnover ratio; it shows how efficiently assets are used to generate sales. Higher could mean more efficient use of assets.

5. **Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities**: This is like the equity-to-liability ratio. A higher value means more equity compared to liabilities, which is generally safer as it indicates lower debt.

Now, I need to decide how to structure the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. Since depth is limited, the tree will have a root node and one level of children (depth 1) plus another split on each child (depth 2).

I think about which features are most important in determining bankruptcy. Typically, metrics like liquidity, profitability, and leverage are key. Working Capital/Total Assets (liquidity), EBIT/Total Assets (profitability), and Book Value Equity/Liabilities (leverage) seem crucial.

Let me consider the primary feature for the root node. The example used petal width as the first split because it's a strong differentiator among species. Similarly, in finance, Working Capital/Total Assets is a direct indicator of liquidity, which is vital for avoiding bankruptcy. So I'll choose that as the first split.

Next, what threshold should I use? In the example, they used <=0.80 and >0.80. For Working Capital, maybe 0.20 is a good cutoff because negative working capital can signal problems. So if Working Capital/TA is <=0.20, it's a sign of low liquidity, which might lead to bankruptcy.

Now, for the right child (Working Capital >0.20), I need another feature to split on. Among the remaining features, EBIT/Total Assets is a strong indicator of profitability. Companies with positive and higher EBIT are more likely to stay solvent. So perhaps using <=0.15 as a threshold. If EBIT/TA is <=0.15, even if working capital is okay, low profitability might still lead to bankruptcy.

For the left child (Working Capital <=0.20), another important factor is leverage, so Book Value Equity/Liabilities could be the next split. Maybe using <=0.80 as a threshold. If equity/liabilities are too low, it indicates high debt, which is risky.

Putting it all together:

- Root: Working Capital/TA <=0.20
  - If yes, check Equity/Liabilities: if <=0.80, bankruptcy; else, not.
- Else (Working Capital >0.20), check EBIT/TA:
  - If <=0.15, bankruptcy; else, not.

I need to ensure this makes sense. High working capital is good, so companies above 0.20 are safer unless their profitability is too low. For those with low working capital, if they're also highly leveraged, it's worse. This structure seems logical.

I should double-check if other features might be better in the second split but considering maximum depth and importance, this seems optimal.

Alright, so I need to create a Python function that predicts whether a company went bankrupt or not based on the given financial features. The decision tree has a maximum depth of 2, which means it can have up to three layers: the root node and two levels of child nodes.

First, let's understand the features provided:

1. **WC/TA (Working Capital/Total Assets)**: This ratio indicates the company's liquidity. A lower value could mean the company is struggling to meet its short-term obligations.
   
2. **RE/TA (Retained Earnings/Total Assets)**: Retained earnings show the portion of profit reinvested in the company. Lower retained earnings might indicate financial stress.

3. **EBIT/TA (Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets)**: This measures the profitability of a company before interest and taxes. A lower value could signal poor profitability.

4. **S/TA (Sales/Total Assets)**: This ratio assesses how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales. Lower sales relative to assets might indicate inefficiency.

5. **BVE/BVL (Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities)**: This ratio compares the company's equity to its liabilities. A lower value could mean higher debt relative to equity, indicating potential financial distress.

The target variable is whether the company went bankrupt (1) or not (0).

Given this information, I need to design a decision tree that uses these features effectively within a depth of 2.

I'll start by selecting the most relevant feature for the root node. Since liquidity and profitability are critical indicators of a company's financial health, I'm inclined to choose **WC/TA** as the first split because it directly relates to the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations.

Next, for the second level nodes, I need to consider features that complement WC/TA in predicting bankruptcy. **EBIT/TA** seems appropriate here since it provides insight into the company's profitability, which is another crucial factor in determining financial stability.

So, the decision tree will look like this:

1. Root Node: Check if **WC/TA** <= 0.20.
   - If true, proceed to the left child node.
   - If false, proceed to the right child node.

2. Left Child Node (WC/TA <= 0.20): Check if **BVE/BVL** <= 0.80.
   - If true, predict bankruptcy (1).
   - If false, predict not bankrupt (0).

3. Right Child Node (WC/TA > 0.20): Check if **EBIT/TA** <= 0.15.
   - If true, predict bankruptcy (1).
   - If false, predict not bankrupt (0).

These thresholds are chosen based on general financial analysis practices:
- A WC/TA ratio of 0.20 is a common benchmark for determining liquidity issues.
- A BVE/BVL ratio of 0.80 indicates that the company's equity is not sufficiently covering its liabilities, pointing to potential insolvency.
- An EBIT/TA ratio of 0.15 reflects marginal profitability, which, combined with lower WC/TA, could signal financial distress.

Now, I'll translate this decision tree into a Python function. The function will take a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and return both the prediction (0 or 1) and a list indicating whether each inner node's condition was satisfied (1 if true, 0 otherwise).

Hereâ€™s how the function will work step by step:

1. **Check WC/TA**: Determine if Working Capital to Total Assets ratio is less than or equal to 0.20.
   - Store this result in `nodes[0]`.

2. **Evaluate subsequent nodes based on the first condition**:
   - If `nodes[0]` is true, check if BVE/BVL <= 0.80 and store this in `nodes[1]`.
     - Based on `nodes[1]`, decide the prediction.
   - If `nodes[0]` is false, check if EBIT/TA <= 0.15 and store this in `nodes[1]`.
     - Based on `nodes[1]`, decide the prediction.

3. **Return the final prediction and the list of node evaluations**.

This approach ensures that the function accurately reflects the decision-making process of the tree, providing both a prediction and insight into which nodes influenced the outcome.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2
    
    # First inner node condition: WC/TA <= 0.20
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.20
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Second inner node condition under the first node: BVE/BVL <= 0.80
        nodes[1] = X["BVE/BVL"] <= 0.80
        prediction = 1 if not nodes[1] else 0
    else:
        # Second inner node condition under the second node: EBIT/TA <= 0.15
        nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.15
        prediction = 1 if not nodes[1] else 0
    
    # Convert boolean values to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
example_features = {
    "WC/TA": 0.15,
    "RE/TA": 0.30,
    "EBIT/TA": 0.10,
    "S/TA": 0.50,
    "BVE/BVL": 0.70
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes evaluation: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Definition**: The `predict` function takes a dictionary `X` containing the financial feature values of a company.

2. **Node Evaluation**:
   - The first node checks if the ratio of Working Capital to Total Assets (`WC/TA`) is less than or equal to 0.20.
   - Depending on this result, the second node evaluates either the Book Value of Equity to Liabilities (`BVE/BVL`) or Earnings Before Interest and Tax to Total Assets (`EBIT/TA`).

3. **Prediction Logic**:
   - If the company's `WC/TA` is below the threshold, it proceeds to check if `BVE/BVL` is also below its respective threshold to determine insolvency.
   - If `WC/TA` is above the threshold, it evaluates the profitability through `EBIT/TA`.

4. **Return Values**:
   - The function returns a tuple with the prediction (0 for not bankrupt, 1 for bankrupt) and a list of integers indicating whether each inner node condition was met.

This structured approach ensures clarity in how each financial metric contributes to the bankruptcy prediction, enhancing both accuracy and interpretability.
