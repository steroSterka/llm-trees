Okay, so the user wants me to build a decision tree classifier that determines whether a company went bankrupt or not. They provided some features and asked for a tree with a maximum depth of 2. Let me try to break this down.

First, looking at their example using Iris data, they used petal width as the primary feature, then within each branch, they used another feature like petal length. So in my case, I need to pick two features out of the given five: Working Capital/Total Assets (WC_TA), Retained Earnings/Total Assets (RE_TA), EBIT/Total Assets (EBIT_TA), Sales/Total Assets (Sales_TA), and Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities (BV_EQ_BV_LIAB).

Hmm, I think the most important features for bankruptcy prediction are often financial ratios that indicate liquidity and profitability. Working Capital to Total Assets might show liquidity, while Retained Earnings could indicate past profitability or reinvestment. Maybe those two would be good candidates.

So at the root of the tree, I'll use WC_TA. Companies with lower working capital relative to assets might be struggling. Let's say if WC_TA is <= 0.20, then it goes to a bankrupt node because low liquidity could mean trouble.

If WC_TA > 0.20, then the next feature should be something that looks at profitability or another financial health indicator. RE_TA seems good here. If RE_TA is <= 0.30, maybe the company isn't retaining enough earnings, so bankruptcy is likely. Otherwise, they're not bankrupt.

Wait, but I need to make sure these thresholds make sense. Typically, lower ratios in these areas are bad signs. So setting WC_TA at 0.20 and RE_TA at 0.30 seems reasonable, but maybe I should look up typical thresholds used in bankruptcy prediction models. Oh well, since it's a max depth of 2, this structure makes sense.

I think that covers all possibilities. Let me visualize the tree:

Root: WC_TA <= 0.20 → bankrupt.
If not, check RE_TA. If RE_TA <=0.30 → bankrupt; else, not bankrupt.

Yeah, that should work. I'll present it in the same format as their example.
</think>

Decision Tree:
|--- Working Capital/Total Assets (WC_TA) <= 0.20
||--- class: bankrupt
|--- Working Capital/Total Assets (WC_TA) > 0.20
||--- Retained Earnings/Total Assets (RE_TA) <= 0.30
||||--- class: bankrupt
||--- Retained Earnings/Total Assets (RE_TA) > 0.30
||||--- class: not bankrupt

Okay, I need to create a Python function that predicts whether a company went bankrupt based on the given financial features. The decision tree should have a maximum depth of 2 and use the most important features. Also, the function needs to return not only the prediction (0 for no bankruptcy, 1 for bankruptcy) but also a list indicating whether each inner node's condition was satisfied (1 if true, 0 otherwise).

First, I'll look at the features provided:

- WC/TA: Working Capital / Total Assets
- RE/TA: Retained Earnings / Total Assets
- EBIT/TA: Earnings Before Interest and Tax / Total Assets
- S/TA: Sales / Total Assets
- BVE/BVL: Book Value of Equity / Book Value of Liabilities

The target variable is 'target', where 0 means the company did not go bankrupt, and 1 means it did.

I need to decide which two features are most important for predicting bankruptcy. Often, in financial analysis, metrics like Working Capital/Total Assets (liquidity) and Retained Earnings/Total Assets (profitability) are strong indicators of a company's health. I'll choose these two as the primary features for my decision tree.

At the first level (root node), I'll use WC/TA. If this ratio is below a certain threshold, it might indicate poor liquidity, which could lead to bankruptcy. A common threshold for such ratios can be around 0.2; however, depending on the industry, this can vary. For simplicity, I'll set it at 0.2.

If WC/TA > 0.2, then I'll look at RE/TA. Retained earnings indicate how much profit a company has reinvested. A lower ratio here might suggest poor profitability or financial distress. Again, setting a threshold around 0.3 seems reasonable.

Now, I need to translate this logic into a Python function. The function will take a dictionary of features as input and return the prediction along with a list indicating whether each condition in the inner nodes was met.

I'll structure the function as follows:

1. Extract the necessary features from the input dictionary.
2. Evaluate the conditions for each node.
3. Based on these evaluations, determine the final prediction.
4. Return both the prediction and the list of node evaluations.

Let's proceed to write this function step by step, ensuring clarity and correctness in each part.
</think>

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree logic based on the selected financial features:

```python
def predict(X: dict) -> tuple[int, list[bool]]:
    # Initialize the nodes list with two elements corresponding to our conditions
    nodes = [None] * 2
    
    # Evaluate the first condition: WC/TA <= 0.2
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.2
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If true, evaluate the second condition: RE/TA <= 0.3
        nodes[1] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.3
        
        # Determine prediction based on the second node's evaluation
        prediction = 1 if not nodes[1] else 0
    else:
        # If first condition is false, predict bankruptcy (1)
        prediction = 1
        # Since we didn't evaluate the second node, set it to False or any appropriate value
        nodes[1] = False
    
    # Return the prediction and the evaluated conditions as a list of booleans
    return prediction, [bool(nodes[0]), bool(nodes[1])]
```

### Explanation:

- **Nodes List**: This keeps track of whether each condition in our decision tree was met. It has two elements since our tree has a maximum depth of 2.
  
- **First Condition (WC/TA <= 0.2)**: This checks the company's liquidity. If the working capital to total assets ratio is below or equal to 0.2, it suggests potential liquidity issues.

- **Second Condition (RE/TA <= 0.3)**: If the first condition is met, we then check the retained earnings to total assets ratio. A lower value here might indicate profitability problems.

- **Prediction Logic**: 
  - If both conditions are true, it suggests the company is at higher risk of bankruptcy.
  - If only the first condition is true, we predict bankruptcy based on poor liquidity.
  - If the first condition is false, it means the company has adequate liquidity, and we do not predict bankruptcy.

This function provides a clear and interpretable way to predict bankruptcy based on key financial metrics.
