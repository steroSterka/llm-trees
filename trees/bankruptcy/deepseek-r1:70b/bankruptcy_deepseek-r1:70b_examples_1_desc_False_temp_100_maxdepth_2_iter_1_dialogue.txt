Alright, so I have to build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 using the given features to determine if a company went bankrupt or not. The features provided are:

1. Working Capital/Total Assets
2. Retained Earnings/Total Assets
3. Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
4. Sales/Total Assets
5. Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities

First, I need to understand each feature and how it relates to bankruptcy.

- **Working Capital/Total Assets**: This ratio indicates the liquidity available to cover operating expenses. Lower values might suggest liquidity issues.
  
- **Retained Earnings/Total Assets**: Retained earnings show profitability over time. Negative or low retained earnings could indicate financial distress.
  
- **Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT)/Total Assets**: Measures profitability before interest and taxes. Low EBIT suggests poor profitability.
  
- **Sales/Total Assets**: This is the asset turnover ratio, indicating how efficiently assets are used to generate sales. Lower values might imply underutilization of assets.
  
- **Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities**: A lower value here means equity is low relative to liabilities, which could signal higher debt and potential bankruptcy risk.

Next, I need to determine the most important features. Typically, in financial distress prediction, ratios like EBIT/Total Assets and Book Value of Equity/Liabilities are strong predictors because they directly relate to profitability and solvency. However, Working Capital/Total Assets is also crucial for liquidity.

Since the tree can have a maximum depth of 2, it means there will be two levels of splits. I need to choose which feature to split on first, then another feature for the second level.

Looking at the example given in the problem statement, they used petal width twice because it's the most distinguishing feature among the species. Similarly, here, maybe one of these financial ratios is more critical than others.

I should probably start with the most impactful feature. EBIT/Total Assets (profitability) and Book Value of Equity/Liabilities (solvency) are both strong indicators. Maybe I'll pick EBIT/TA as the first split because profitability is a key driver of bankruptcy.

If EBIT/TA is low, say below a certain threshold, it might indicate higher risk. Then, for companies with EBIT/TA above that, I can look at another feature to differentiate further. Alternatively, starting with Book Value of Equity/Liabilities could also make sense because a lower ratio means more debt.

Wait, perhaps using Working Capital/Total Assets first is better because liquidity is immediate. If a company can't cover its short-term liabilities, it might go bankrupt sooner than later, regardless of profitability.

Alternatively, in the example given, they used petal width twice at different thresholds. So maybe I should pick one feature that's most important and split on it twice at two different levels.

But in this case, each feature measures a different aspect. Maybe it's better to use one for the first split and another for the second.

Let me think: if I choose EBIT/TA as the root node. If EBIT/TA is very low, say <= 0.10 (hypothetically), then the company might be classified as bankrupt. For those above 0.10, maybe check their Working Capital/TA. If that's also low, say <= 0.20, then they're more likely to go bankrupt.

Alternatively, after EBIT/TA, using Book Value of Equity/Liabilities could make sense because even if a company is profitable but has too much debt, it might still be at risk.

But I'm not sure which feature combination is better without data. Since the example used one feature split into two levels, maybe I should do the same here for simplicity and because we don't have actual data to test.

So perhaps pick EBIT/TA as the primary feature. First split: if EBIT/TA <= 0.15 (hypothetical threshold), classify as bankrupt. If above, then check Book Value of Equity/Liabilities. If that's <= 1.00, maybe it's still okay, but if higher or lower? Wait, a lower Book Value of Equity relative to Liabilities is worse because it means more debt.

Wait, actually, the ratio Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities. So lower values indicate more liabilities compared to equity, which is bad. Therefore, if after EBIT/TA > 0.15, I check this ratio: if <= 0.50 (hypothetically), then bankrupt because even though they're somewhat profitable, their debt is too high.

Alternatively, maybe the first split should be on Book Value of Equity/Liabilities because solvency is critical. If that's low, say <= 0.30, classify as bankrupt. Then for others, check EBIT/TA: if <= 0.10, then bankrupt; else, not.

I think I'll go with the first approach: split on EBIT/TA at the root because profitability is a strong indicator. Then, for those above the threshold, use Book Value of Equity/Liabilities to further assess.

But without actual data, these thresholds are just placeholders. In practice, we'd need to determine them based on the dataset.

So, the tree would look something like:

- Root: EBIT/TA <= 0.15? If yes, likely bankrupt.
- Else, check Book Value of Equity/Liabilities <= 0.50? If yes, then bankrupt; else, not bankrupt.

Alternatively, if using Working Capital/TA as the first split because liquidity is immediate:

- Root: Working Capital/TA <= 0.20? Bankrupt.
- Else, check EBIT/TA <= 0.10? If yes, bankrupt; else, not.

I think both approaches are valid, but I'll stick with the first one using EBIT/TA and then solvency because profitability and debt structure together paint a comprehensive picture.

So the final decision tree would have two levels: first split on EBIT/TA, then on Book Value of Equity/Liabilities.

Decision Tree for Bankruptcy Classification:

1. **Root Node**: Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets (EBIT/TA)
   - If EBIT/TA ≤ 0.15:
     - Class: Bankrupt
   - Else:
     - Proceed to next level.

2. **Second Level**:
   - Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities
     - If ≤ 0.50:
       - Class: Bankrupt
     - Else:
       - Class: Not Bankrupt

This tree uses profitability (EBIT/TA) as the primary indicator and solvency (Book Value ratio) as the secondary check, providing a structured approach to assess bankruptcy risk.

Okay, so I need to format a decision tree as a Python function that returns both the prediction and a list of truth values for each inner node. The function should take a dictionary X with specific feature keys.

First, I should identify the structure of the decision tree based on the given features and target variable. Since there are several financial ratios provided (WC/TA, RE/TA, EBIT/TA, S/TA, BVE/BVL), I need to decide which ones to use as splitting criteria in the nodes.

I remember that in decision trees for bankruptcy prediction, common variables used include measures like WC/TA, RE/TA, EBIT/TA. So maybe the tree uses these at different levels.

Let's say the first node checks if WC/TA is above a certain threshold. If it is, then we predict not bankrupt (0). Otherwise, move to the next node. The second node could check RE/TA; if it's above another threshold, predict 0, else predict 1.

I need to assign meaningful thresholds. For example, from some financial analysis, maybe a WC/TA of 0.3 and RE/TA of 0.2 could be used as the splitting points.

So the function will have two nodes: node 0 is X['WC/TA'] > 0.3? If yes, prediction is 0. If no, check node 1: X['RE/TA'] > 0.2. If yes, prediction 0; else 1.

The nodes list should track the condition results as 1 (True) or 0 (False). So for each inner node evaluation, append 1 if condition met, 0 otherwise.

Wait, but in Python, True is equivalent to 1 and False to 0 when converted. So I can just cast the boolean results to integers.

Putting it all together, the function will compute each node's condition in order, store their truth values, then use them to decide the prediction based on the tree structure.

I think that covers the necessary steps.

Here is a decision tree implemented as a Python function for bankruptcy prediction:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = []
    
    # Node 0: Check if WC/TA > 0.3
    node_0 = X['WC/TA'] > 0.3
    nodes.append(1 if node_0 else 0)
    
    # Node 1: Check if RE/TA > 0.2
    node_1 = X['RE/TA'] > 0.2
    nodes.append(1 if node_1 else 0)
    
    if node_0:
        prediction = 0
    else:
        if node_1:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **Node 0**: Evaluates whether `WC/TA` (Working Capital to Total Assets) is greater than 0.3. This ratio measures liquidity. A higher value suggests better liquidity and lower bankruptcy risk.
  
- **Node 1**: If Node 0 is false, then checks if `RE/TA` (Retained Earnings to Total Assets) exceeds 0.2. This indicates profitability and reinvestment capacity.

- The function returns a prediction of 0 (not bankrupt) or 1 (bankrupt) based on these evaluations, along with the truth values of each node as a list.
