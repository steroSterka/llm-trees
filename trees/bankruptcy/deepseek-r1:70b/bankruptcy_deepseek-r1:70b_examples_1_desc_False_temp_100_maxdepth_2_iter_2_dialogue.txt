Alright, so I need to help the user build a decision tree classifier using certain financial features to predict if a company went bankrupt. The maximum depth is 2, which means it's going to have two levels of splits.

First, let me understand the problem. The user provided an example with sepal and petal measurements for classifying Iris species. Now they want something similar but for bankruptcy prediction using financial ratios.

Looking at the features given:

1. Working Capital/Total Assets
2. Retained Earnings/Total Assets
3. EBIT/Total Assets (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes)
4. Sales/Total Assets
5. Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities

I need to figure out which two features are the most important for predicting bankruptcy. Usually, financial ratios related to profitability, leverage, and liquidity are key in such models.

Working Capital/Total Assets indicates liquidity – how much liquid assets a company has relative to its total assets. Higher could mean better liquidity, but maybe too high isn't good? Not sure yet.

Retained Earnings/Total Assets shows profitability and how much the company is reinvesting. Lower retained earnings might indicate poor performance or dividend payouts.

EBIT/Total Assets is another profitability measure. It shows how efficiently assets are used to generate earnings before interest and taxes.

Sales/Total Assets relates to asset turnover – how well assets are generating sales. Low could mean underutilized assets, but maybe high is better?

Book Value of Equity/Liabilities ratio indicates leverage. A lower value means more debt relative to equity, which can be risky for solvency.

I think the most important features would relate to profitability and leverage since these are strong indicators of a company's health. So probably EBIT/Total Assets and Book Value of Equity/Liabilities are top candidates.

Now, building a tree with max depth 2. Let me decide the splits:

First split on EBIT/TA because if a company isn't making enough earnings relative to its assets, it's more likely to go bankrupt. Then, within that, split further using the leverage ratio.

So root node: EBIT/TA <= some threshold. If yes, then check Book Value of Equity/Liabilities <= another threshold. Both being bad could mean bankruptcy.

But wait, I need to set these thresholds. Typically, in decision trees, these are determined during training, but since this is a hypothetical example, I'll choose reasonable values based on common financial knowledge.

For EBIT/TA, if it's very low or negative, that's a problem. Maybe <= 0 would indicate unprofitable companies, but sometimes positive thresholds are used. Alternatively, maybe 5% as a rough cut-off.

For Book Value of Equity/Liabilities ratio, a lower value (like <=0.5) could indicate higher debt, increasing bankruptcy risk.

So the structure would be:

- Root: EBIT/TA <= 0.05
  - If yes:
    - Check if Book Value of Equity/Liabilities <= 0.5 → Bankrupt
    - Else → Not Bankrupt
  - If no (EBIT/TA >0.05) → Not Bankrupt

This makes a shallow tree that's easy to interpret and uses the two most important features.

Here is a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 for classifying whether a company went bankrupt or not, using the most important financial features provided:

### Decision Tree:
|--- EBIT/Total Assets <= 0.05  
||--- Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities <= 0.5  
||||--- class: Bankrupt  
||--- Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities > 0.5  
||||--- class: Not Bankrupt  
|--- EBIT/Total Assets > 0.05  
||--- class: Not Bankrupt  

### Explanation:
1. **First Split**: The most important feature for distinguishing between bankrupt and non-bankrupt companies is "EBIT/Total Assets" (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes divided by Total Assets). This ratio measures a company's profitability relative to its asset base. A lower value indicates poor profitability.
2. **Second Split**: For companies where "EBIT/Total Assets" is less than or equal to 0.05, the next most important feature is "Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities," which measures a company's solvency and leverage. A lower value here indicates higher financial distress.

This decision tree uses the two most critical features for bankruptcy prediction: profitability (EBIT/Total Assets) and solvency (Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities).

Okay, so I need to create a Python function that predicts whether a company went bankrupt based on some financial features. The decision tree should have a maximum depth of 2, which means it can only split the data in two levels.

First, let me look at the features provided:

- 'WC/TA' (Working Capital/Total Assets)
- 'RE/TA' (Retained Earnings/Total Assets)
- 'EBIT/TA' (Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets)
- 'S/TA' (Sales/Total Assets)
- 'BVE/BVL' (Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities)

The target variable is 'target', which indicates whether the company went bankrupt (1) or not (0).

From my earlier analysis, I determined that 'EBIT/TA' and 'BVE/BVL' are the most critical features for predicting bankruptcy. So, I'll use these two in my decision tree.

Now, how do I decide on the thresholds for these features? Well, a lower 'EBIT/TA' suggests poor profitability, so maybe I can set a threshold around 0.05. For 'BVE/BVL', a lower value indicates higher leverage and potential financial distress, so perhaps a threshold of 1.5 would work.

So, the decision tree will first check if 'EBIT/TA' is less than or equal to 0.05. If it is, then it will further check if 'BVE/BVL' is less than or equal to 1.5. Based on these conditions, it will predict whether the company went bankrupt.

Next, I need to format this into a Python function that takes a dictionary of features and returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes (1 if the condition is met, 0 otherwise).

I'll define the function `predict_bankruptcy` which takes a dictionary `X`. Inside the function, I'll initialize a list `nodes` with two elements to represent the two conditions in my decision tree. 

The first node checks if 'EBIT/TA' is less than or equal to 0.05. The second node checks if 'BVE/BVL' is less than or equal to 1.5.

Then, based on these nodes:

- If both conditions are met (nodes[0] and nodes[1]), the prediction is that the company went bankrupt (target = 1).
- If only the first condition is met but not the second, it still predicts bankruptcy.
- If neither condition is met, it predicts no bankruptcy.

Wait, does this make sense? Let me think again. Maybe if both conditions are true, the company is more likely to have gone bankrupt. But if only 'EBIT/TA' is low, that's already a strong indicator of financial trouble. So perhaps my initial logic needs adjustment.

Perhaps it should be:

- If 'EBIT/TA' <= 0.05 and 'BVE/BVL' <= 1.5 → bankruptcy (1)
- Else if 'EBIT/TA' > 0.05 → no bankruptcy (0)

But wait, that doesn't cover all cases. What about when 'EBIT/TA' <= 0.05 but 'BVE/BVL' > 1.5? Maybe the company is still at risk.

Alternatively, maybe if either condition is met, it predicts bankruptcy. But I need to structure this correctly in the decision tree.

Perhaps the correct approach is:

- First check if 'EBIT/TA' <= 0.05.
    - If true, then check if 'BVE/BVL' <= 1.5.
        - If true → predict bankruptcy (1)
        - Else → predict no bankruptcy (0)
    - If false → predict no bankruptcy (0)

This way, only companies with poor profitability and high leverage are predicted to have gone bankrupt.

But wait, that might be too restrictive. Maybe even if 'BVE/BVL' is not <= 1.5, a very low 'EBIT/TA' should still indicate potential bankruptcy.

Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust the logic based on real-world financial analysis. Companies with negative 'EBIT/TA' are already in trouble, regardless of their leverage. So maybe if 'EBIT/TA' <= 0.05, regardless of 'BVE/BVL', the prediction is bankruptcy.

But then, what's the point of checking 'BVE/BVL'? Maybe I should prioritize 'EBIT/TA' as the primary indicator and only use 'BVE/BVL' as a secondary check if needed.

Given that my decision tree can have up to two levels, it's better to structure it so that both conditions are checked sequentially.

So, let me structure the function as follows:

- Check if 'EBIT/TA' <= 0.05 → node[0] = True or False
    - If true:
        - Check if 'BVE/BVL' <= 1.5 → node[1] = True or False
            - If both nodes are true → predict bankruptcy (1)
            - Else → no bankruptcy (0)
    - Else → no bankruptcy (0)

Wait, but according to my earlier analysis, I should consider 'EBIT/TA' as the primary indicator. So perhaps if 'EBIT/TA' <= 0.05, regardless of 'BVE/BVL', it's a strong indicator of bankruptcy.

But in that case, checking 'BVE/BVL' might not be necessary unless it provides additional predictive power.

Maybe I should test this logic with some sample data or refer to financial metrics to see how these ratios typically perform for bankrupt companies.

Alternatively, perhaps the Altman Z-score could provide a better framework, but since I'm limited to two features, I'll stick with 'EBIT/TA' and 'BVE/BVL'.

Given all that, my function will follow the initial structure: first check 'EBIT/TA', then 'BVE/BVL', and based on both conditions, predict the outcome.

Now, writing this into code:

def predict_bankruptcy(X):
    nodes = [False, False]
    
    if X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05:
        nodes[0] = True
        if X['BVE/BVL'] <= 1.5:
            nodes[1] = True
    
    # Determine prediction based on nodes
    if nodes[0] and nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1  # Bankruptcy
    else:
        prediction = 0  # No bankruptcy
    
    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but this would only predict bankruptcy if both conditions are met. But perhaps I should predict bankruptcy even if only 'EBIT/TA' is <= 0.05.

Maybe adjust the logic:

if X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05:
    nodes[0] = True
    prediction = 1  # Assume bankruptcy
    
    if X['BVE/BVL'] > 1.5:
        prediction = 0  # Maybe not bankrupt if leverage is better

Wait, no, that's getting complicated. Perhaps I should prioritize 'EBIT/TA' as the main indicator.

Alternative approach:

if X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05:
    nodes[0] = True
    prediction = 1  # Likely bankruptcy
    
    if X['BVE/BVL'] > 1.5:
        prediction = 0  # Maybe not bankrupt despite poor profitability

else:
    nodes[0] = False
    prediction = 0

But this way, only companies with 'EBIT/TA' <= 0.05 and 'BVE/BVL' > 1.5 are predicted as not bankrupt.

However, I'm not sure if this accurately reflects real-world scenarios. Perhaps a better approach is to use both conditions additively.

Alternatively, maybe just using 'EBIT/TA' alone is sufficient for the prediction, with 'BVE/BVL' providing additional confirmation.

Given that my decision tree has two levels, I need to ensure that both conditions are checked in sequence.

Perhaps the correct way is:

- First check 'EBIT/TA' <= 0.05 → if true, proceed to next node
    - Then check 'BVE/BVL' <= 1.5 → if true, predict bankruptcy (1)
        - Else, predict no bankruptcy (0)
    - If first condition false → predict no bankruptcy

But in code, it would be:

if X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05:
    nodes[0] = True
    if X['BVE/BVL'] <= 1.5:
        nodes[1] = True
        prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 0
else:
    nodes[0] = False
    prediction = 0

This way, only companies with both poor profitability and high leverage are predicted to have gone bankrupt.

But perhaps I need to adjust the thresholds. Maybe 'EBIT/TA' <= 0.05 is too strict; maybe it should be lower or higher.

Alternatively, I could use industry benchmarks for these ratios to set more appropriate thresholds.

Overall, this seems like a reasonable approach given the constraints of using two features in a decision tree.
</think>

Here's a structured and elegant solution based on the thought process:

### Solution Code
```python
def predict_bankruptcy(X):
    nodes = [False, False]
    
    # First condition: EBIT/TA <= 0.05
    if X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05:
        nodes[0] = True
        
        # Second condition: BVE/BVL <= 1.5
        if X['BVE/BVL'] <= 1.5:
            nodes[1] = True
    
    # Determine prediction based on the conditions met
    prediction = 1 if (nodes[0] and nodes[1]) else 0
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation

The function `predict_bankruptcy` takes a dictionary `X` containing financial metrics of a company. It uses a decision tree approach with two levels to predict whether the company is likely to go bankrupt based on two key financial ratios: EBIT/TA (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes divided by Total Assets) and BVE/BVL (Book Value of Equity divided by Market Value of Liabilities).

1. **First Condition**: The function checks if the EBIT/TA ratio is less than or equal to 0.05. If true, it sets the first node to `True`, indicating poor profitability.

2. **Second Condition**: If the first condition is met, the function proceeds to check if the BVE/BVL ratio is less than or equal to 1.5. If this second condition is also true, it sets the second node to `True`, indicating high leverage.

3. **Prediction**: The company is predicted to be at risk of bankruptcy (returns `1`) only if both conditions are satisfied. Otherwise, it returns `0`, indicating no immediate risk of bankruptcy.

This approach sequentially evaluates financial health metrics to make a binary prediction on bankruptcy risk, providing a clear and interpretable model based on two key financial indicators.
