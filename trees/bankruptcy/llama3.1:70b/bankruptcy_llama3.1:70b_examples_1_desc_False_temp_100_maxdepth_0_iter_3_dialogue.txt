I'll induce a decision tree classifier based on the given features. Here's the decision tree:

|--- Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.10
||--- class: Bankrupt
|--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.10
||--- Retained Earnings/Total Assets <= -0.20
|||--- class: Bankrupt
||--- Retained Earnings/Total Assets > -0.20
|||--- Sales/Total Assets <= 0.50
||||--- class: Non-Bankrupt
|||--- Sales/Total Assets > 0.50
||||--- class: Non-Bankrupt

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* The first split is based on Working Capital/Total Assets, which is a common indicator of a company's liquidity and financial health. A value less than or equal to 0.10 suggests that the company may be struggling to meet its short-term obligations, increasing the likelihood of bankruptcy.
* The second split is based on Retained Earnings/Total Assets, which represents a company's accumulated profits over time. A negative value indicates that the company has accumulated losses, increasing the risk of bankruptcy.
* The third split is based on Sales/Total Assets, which measures a company's revenue-generating ability relative to its asset base. A low value may indicate that the company is struggling to generate sufficient revenue to cover its expenses and debts.

Note that this decision tree is not exhaustive, and other features or combinations of features might also be relevant for predicting bankruptcy. Additionally, the thresholds used in the splits are arbitrary and may need to be adjusted based on the specific dataset being used.

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting bankruptcy:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.10
    nodes[0] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.10
    
    # Node 2: Retained Earnings/Total Assets <= -0.20
    if not nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X['RE/TA'] <= -0.20
    else:
        nodes[1] = False
        
    # Node 3: Sales/Total Assets <= 0.50
    if not nodes[1] and not nodes[0]:
        nodes[2] = X['S/TA'] <= 0.50
    else:
        nodes[2] = False
    
    prediction = None
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    elif nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1
    elif not nodes[2]:
        prediction = 0
    else:
        prediction = 0
    
    # Convert boolean values to integers (1 or 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input where the keys are feature names and the values are feature values. It returns a tuple containing the predicted class label (`prediction`) and a list of integers representing the truth values of the inner nodes (`nodes`).
