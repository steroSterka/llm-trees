Based on the provided features, I will build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a company went bankrupt or not.

Here is the induced decision tree:

|--- Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets <= 0.055
||--- class: Bankrupt
|--- Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets > 0.055
||--- Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.185
|||--- Retained Earnings/Total Assets <= -0.035
||||--- class: Bankrupt
|||--- Retained Earnings/Total Assets > -0.035
||||--- class: Not Bankrupt
||--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.185
|||--- class: Not Bankrupt

Explanation:

1. The most important feature is Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets (EBIT/TA), which is a measure of profitability. If this ratio is low (<= 0.055), the company is more likely to go bankrupt.
2. If EBIT/TA is high (> 0.055), the next most important feature is Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA). If WC/TA is low (<= 0.185), indicating liquidity issues, we need to consider another feature.
3. Retained Earnings/Total Assets (RE/TA) is the next feature considered when WC/TA is low. If RE/TA is also low (<= -0.035), it may indicate a company with a history of losses, making bankruptcy more likely.
4. If RE/TA is high (> -0.035), despite having liquidity issues (low WC/TA), the company is less likely to go bankrupt.

This decision tree suggests that companies with low profitability (EBIT/TA) and liquidity issues (WC/TA) are more likely to go bankrupt, especially if they have a history of losses (RE/TA).

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Inner node 1: EBIT/TA <= -0.035
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= -0.035
    
    # Inner node 2: WC/TA <= 0.185 (only considered if inner node 1 is True)
    nodes[1] = False
    if not nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.185
    
    # Inner node 3: RE/TA <= -0.035 (only considered if inner nodes 1 and 2 are True)
    nodes[2] = False
    if nodes[0] or nodes[1]:
        nodes[2] = X['RE/TA'] <= -0.035
    
    # Inner node 4: WC/TA > 0.185 (only considered if inner nodes 1 and 2 are True)
    nodes[3] = False
    if not nodes[0] and nodes[1]:
        nodes[3] = X['WC/TA'] > 0.185
    
    # Inner node 5: RE/TA > -0.035 (only considered if inner nodes 1, 2, and 4 are True)
    nodes[4] = False
    if not nodes[0] and nodes[1] and nodes[3]:
        nodes[4] = X['RE/TA'] > -0.035
    
    # Make prediction based on the decision tree
    if nodes[2] or (nodes[0] and not nodes[2]):
        prediction = 1  # Company went bankrupt
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Company did not go bankrupt
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

You can call this function with a dictionary `X` containing the feature values as follows:

```python
X = {
    'WC/TA': 0.15,
    'RE/TA': -0.02,
    'EBIT/TA': -0.05,
    'S/TA': 1.2,
    'BVE/BVL': 3.5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print('Prediction:', prediction)
print('Nodes:', nodes)
```
