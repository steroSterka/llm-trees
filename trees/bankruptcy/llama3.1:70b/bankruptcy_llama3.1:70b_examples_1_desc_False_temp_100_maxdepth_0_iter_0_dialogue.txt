Based on the features you provided, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict whether a company went bankrupt or not. Here's the result:

|--- Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.25
||--- class: Bankrupt
|--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.25
||--- Retained Earnings/Total Assets <= 0.15
|||--- class: Bankrupt
||--- Retained Earnings/Total Assets > 0.15
|||--- Sales/Total Assets <= 1.20
||||--- class: Not Bankrupt
|||--- Sales/Total Assets > 1.20
||||--- class: Not Bankrupt

Here's a brief explanation of the tree:

* The first split is based on Working Capital/Total Assets, which indicates a company's ability to pay its short-term debts. If this ratio is less than or equal to 0.25, it's likely that the company will go bankrupt.
* If the Working Capital/Total Assets ratio is greater than 0.25, the next split is based on Retained Earnings/Total Assets, which indicates a company's profitability and ability to generate earnings. If this ratio is less than or equal to 0.15, it's likely that the company will go bankrupt.
* If the Retained Earnings/Total Assets ratio is greater than 0.15, the final split is based on Sales/Total Assets, which indicates a company's revenue generation and growth potential. If this ratio is less than or equal to 1.20, it's likely that the company will not go bankrupt.

Note that this decision tree is just one possible way to classify companies as bankrupt or not bankrupt based on these features. The actual performance of the model may vary depending on the specific data used to train and test it.

Here are some metrics that could be useful for evaluating the performance of this decision tree:

* Accuracy: 85% (assuming a balanced dataset with equal numbers of bankrupt and non-bankrupt companies)
* Precision: 0.9 (bankrupt class), 0.8 (not bankrupt class)
* Recall: 0.8 (bankrupt class), 0.9 (not bankrupt class)

Please note that these metrics are hypothetical, as I didn't actually train the model on any data.

Here is the decision tree as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]*5
    nodes[0] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.15  # Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.15
    nodes[1] = X['RE/TA'] <= -0.20  # Retained Earnings/Total Assets <= -0.20
    nodes[2] = X['S/TA'] <= 1.00  # Sales/Total Assets <= 1.00
    nodes[3] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05  # Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets <= 0.05
    nodes[4] = X['BVE/BVL'] <= 1.50  # Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities <= 1.50

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Company went bankrupt
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Company went bankrupt
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Company did not go bankrupt
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # Company did not go bankrupt
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Company did not go bankrupt

    return prediction, [int(x) for x in nodes]
```

Note that I've used the feature names and target variable encoding provided in your prompt. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where each key corresponds to a feature name.

I've also filled in some threshold values based on common ranges for these financial ratios:

* Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA): <= 0.15 is generally considered low and may indicate liquidity issues.
* Retained Earnings/Total Assets (RE/TA): <= -0.20 is generally considered negative, indicating accumulated losses or dividend payouts exceeding earnings.
* Sales/Total Assets (S/TA): <= 1.00 is a relatively low sales-to-assets ratio, which may indicate inefficient asset utilization.
* Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets (EBIT/TA): <= 0.05 is a relatively low profitability ratio, indicating potential financial distress.
* Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities (BVE/BVL): <= 1.50 is generally considered high leverage, which may increase the risk of bankruptcy.

Please note that these threshold values are just examples and may not be optimal for your specific dataset or problem. You may need to adjust them based on your data distribution and domain expertise.
