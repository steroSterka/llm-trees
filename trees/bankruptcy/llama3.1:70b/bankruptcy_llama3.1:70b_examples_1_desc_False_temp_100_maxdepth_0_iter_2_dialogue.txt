Based on the provided features, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict whether a company went bankrupt or not. Here's the resulting decision tree:

|--- Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.10
||--- class: Bankrupt
|--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.10
||--- Retained Earnings/Total Assets <= 0.30
|||--- class: Bankrupt
||--- Retained Earnings/Total Assets > 0.30
|||--- Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets <= 0.05
||||--- class: Bankrupt
|||--- Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets > 0.05
||||--- class: Not Bankrupt

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

1. The first split is based on Working Capital/Total Assets, with a threshold of 0.10. This suggests that companies with low working capital relative to total assets are more likely to go bankrupt.
2. For companies with higher working capital, the next split is based on Retained Earnings/Total Assets, with a threshold of 0.30. This implies that companies with lower retained earnings (i.e., accumulated profits) are more vulnerable to bankruptcy.
3. If a company has both sufficient working capital and retained earnings, the decision tree examines its profitability using Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets. A threshold of 0.05 separates companies that are likely to be bankrupt from those that are not.

Please note that this is just one possible decision tree, and different trees may result from varying the feature selection or splitting criteria. Additionally, this model should be validated on a separate test dataset to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

Keep in mind that the features used here are based on Altman's Z-score model, which is commonly employed to predict bankruptcy risk. However, other models and features can also be explored for better results.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['WC/TA'] <= -0.10
    nodes[1] = X['RE/TA'] <= -0.30 if not nodes[0] else None
    nodes[2] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05 if not nodes[0] and not nodes[1] else None

    prediction = 0  # company did not go bankrupt
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # company went bankrupt
    elif nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1  # company went bankrupt
    elif not nodes[2]:
        prediction = 0  # company did not go bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the feature values as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted class (0 or 1) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The thresholds used in the decision tree are based on common ranges for these financial ratios.

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* If `WC/TA` is less than or equal to -0.10, the company is likely to go bankrupt (Node 0).
* If `WC/TA` is greater than -0.10 and `RE/TA` is less than or equal to -0.30, the company is likely to go bankrupt (Node 1).
* If both `WC/TA` and `RE/TA` are above their respective thresholds, but `EBIT/TA` is less than or equal to 0.05, the company is likely to go bankrupt (Node 2). Otherwise, it is not.

Note that this decision tree is based on common financial ratios used to assess a company's creditworthiness and may not be optimal for all cases.
