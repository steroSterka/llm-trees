I'll build a decision tree classifier using the provided features to predict whether a company went bankrupt or not. I'll use a maximum depth of 2.

After analyzing the features, here is the decision tree:

|--- Retained Earnings/Total Assets <= 0.14
||--- class: Bankrupt
|--- Retained Earnings/Total Assets > 0.14
||--- Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.23
|||--- class: Bankrupt
||--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.23
|||--- class: Not Bankrupt

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* The first feature to split is Retained Earnings/Total Assets, which indicates a company's ability to generate earnings and retain them. A low value (<= 0.14) suggests that the company may be struggling financially.
* If the company has high retained earnings (> 0.14), we then look at Working Capital/Total Assets, which represents a company's liquidity position. A low value (<= 0.23) indicates potential cash flow problems.

Note that this decision tree is not unique and may vary depending on the specific data used to train the model. Additionally, the thresholds used in the tree (e.g., 0.14 and 0.23) are arbitrary and would typically be determined through a process of cross-validation or grid search.

Please let me know if you'd like me to clarify any aspect of the decision tree!

Here is the Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["RE/TA"] <= -0.35
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.15
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features as input and returns a tuple with two elements: 

*   The first element is the predicted value (0 or 1), where 0 indicates that the company did not go bankrupt and 1 indicates that it did.
*   The second element is a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.

In this case, I used `-0.35` as the threshold for `RE/TA` (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) and `0.15` as the threshold for `WC/TA` (Working Capital/Total Assets). These thresholds were chosen based on common financial ratios, but you may need to adjust them depending on your specific dataset.

Please note that this decision tree is a simple representation of the relationships between features and target variable. In practice, more complex models might be needed to achieve higher accuracy.
