Based on the features you provided for the bankruptcy classification problem, I will induce a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. The most important features will be selected based on their relevance to the target variable (bankruptcy or not). Here is the decision tree:

|--- Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.20
||--- class: Bankrupt
|--- Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.20
||--- Retained Earnings/Total Assets <= 0.40
|||--- class: Bankrupt
||--- Retained Earnings/Total Assets > 0.40
|||--- class: Not Bankrupt

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* The first feature used is Working Capital/Total Assets, which is a common indicator of a company's liquidity and ability to meet its short-term obligations. A value below 0.20 indicates that the company may struggle to pay its debts.
* If Working Capital/Total Assets is above 0.20, the next feature considered is Retained Earnings/Total Assets, which represents a company's accumulated profits over time. A low value (below 0.40) may indicate poor profitability and increased risk of bankruptcy.

Note that this decision tree is simplified and based on hypothetical data. In practice, you would need to train the model using actual data and evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Keep in mind that this is a very simple example, and there are many other factors that could influence bankruptcy. You may want to consider additional features or use more advanced machine learning techniques, such as ensemble methods or neural networks, for improved results.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.20
    nodes[1] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.40
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, [int(x) for x in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values as input. It calculates the truth values of the inner nodes and returns the predicted class label (`prediction`) along with the list of node values.

Note that I used the same threshold values as before, but you may want to adjust them based on your specific dataset.

Also, I converted the node values to integers using `[int(x) for x in nodes]` to match the expected output format.
