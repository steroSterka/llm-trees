<think>
Okay, so I need to create a decision tree for predicting whether a company went bankrupt using the given financial features. Let me start by recalling what a decision tree does. It uses features to split the data into subsets, aiming to separate the classes (bankrupt vs not bankrupt) as pure as possible at each split. The key is to choose the best features and thresholds that maximize this separation.

First, let me list the features provided:

1. Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA)
2. Retained Earnings/Total Assets (RE/TA)
3. Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets (EBIT/TA)
4. Sales/Total Assets (Sales/TA)
5. Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities (BV Equity/BV Liabilities)

These are all financial ratios. The goal is to use these to classify bankruptcy. I remember that decision trees typically use metrics like Gini impurity or information gain to decide splits. Since I don't have the actual data, I need to make educated guesses based on common bankruptcy prediction models.

Let me think about each feature's relevance:

- **WC/TA (Working Capital over Total Assets)**: Working capital is current assets minus current liabilities. A negative WC might indicate liquidity problems. If WC/TA is low, maybe the company can't meet short-term obligations, leading to higher bankruptcy risk.

- **RE/TA (Retained Earnings over Total Assets)**: Retained earnings are profits kept in the company. A negative RE/TA could mean the company has accumulated losses, which is a red flag for bankruptcy.

- **EBIT/TA (Earnings Before Interest and Tax over Total Assets)**: This measures profitability. Lower EBIT/TA might indicate poor profitability, increasing bankruptcy risk.

- **Sales/TA (Sales over Total Assets)**: Asset turnover ratio. Lower sales relative to assets could mean inefficiency or declining sales, which is bad.

- **BV Equity/BV Liabilities (Book Value of Equity over Book Value of Liabilities)**: If this ratio is low (Equity is much less than Liabilities), the company might be over-leveraged, increasing bankruptcy risk.

Now, I need to decide which feature to split first. In decision trees, the root node is the feature that provides the best split. Among these, maybe RE/TA or WC/TA are critical because negative values in these can directly indicate insolvency. Let me think:

Suppose the first split is on RE/TA. If RE/TA <= some threshold (maybe negative?), then bankruptcy is more likely. Alternatively, maybe it's another feature. Alternatively, maybe WC/TA because if Working Capital is negative, that's a strong indicator.

Alternatively, maybe the most important one is the Book Value of Equity over Liabilities. If Equity is less than Liabilities, that's a classic sign of bankruptcy (equity negative). So maybe that's a key split. Let me think through.

Wait, the ratio is BV Equity / BV Liabilities. If that ratio is less than 1, it means Equity is less than Liabilities. So if that ratio <= 1, that could be a strong indicator. Maybe that's the first split.

Alternatively, maybe EBIT/TA. If EBIT is negative (i.e., EBIT/TA <0), that means the company is losing money before interest and taxes, which is bad.

Hmm, perhaps I need to prioritize the features based on their typical importance in bankruptcy models. From what I recall, Altman's Z-Score uses working capital, retained earnings, EBIT, sales, and market value. But since we don't have market value here, maybe similar ratios.

Alternatively, let's consider common thresholds. For example:

1. If the company has negative retained earnings (RE/TA < 0), that's a big red flag. So maybe the first split is on RE/TA <= 0.

But let's see:

Suppose:

Root node: RE/TA <= threshold.

If RE/TA is below a certain point (like 0), then high chance of bankruptcy. But maybe even above 0, other factors matter.

Alternatively, maybe the most important is the Book Value Equity/Liabilities. Suppose if that ratio is below 0.5, meaning equity is half of liabilities, that could be a split.

Alternatively, let's think step by step.

First, the features:

1. WC/TA: Working capital is (current assets - current liabilities). If WC/TA is negative, that means current liabilities exceed current assets, which is bad. So a split on WC/TA <=0 might be a first split.

Suppose:

First split on WC/TA <= threshold (maybe 0). If yes, then bankruptcy likely. If not, proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on RE/TA. Let me think of possible splits.

Another way: Maybe using the features that are most predictive. For example, in some models, the ratio of retained earnings to total assets (RE/TA) being negative is a key indicator. So if RE/TA <0, then the company has accumulated losses, which is a strong predictor.

So first split:

If RE/TA <=0, then class: Bankrupt.

But perhaps even with RE/TA positive, other factors can determine.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the Book Value Equity / Liabilities. If that ratio is <= some threshold (like 0.5), then bankruptcy is more likely.

Alternatively, let's think of the features and possible splits:

Suppose the decision tree starts with EBIT/TA. If EBIT is negative (EBIT/TA <0), the company is losing money, so bankruptcy is likely. So split on EBIT/TA <=0.

Then, if EBIT/TA is negative, maybe that's a bankruptcy class. But maybe even with positive EBIT, if other factors are bad, like low working capital, it could still be bankrupt.

Alternatively, let's try to construct a plausible tree step by step.

Start with the most important feature. Let's say RE/TA.

Split on RE/TA <= 0:

- If yes: Then company has negative retained earnings. Maybe high chance of bankruptcy.

- If no: Proceed to next split.

Then, in the next split, maybe use another feature like WC/TA.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on WC/TA <=0. Because working capital is crucial for liquidity.

Suppose:

First split: WC/TA <= 0

- If yes: Bankrupt (since can't meet short-term obligations)

- If no: Then proceed to next split.

Second split maybe on RE/TA.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on BV Equity/BV Liabilities. Let's see:

If BV Equity / BV Liabilities <=1: That means equity <= liabilities. So if that's the case, the company's assets (equity + liabilities) are such that equity is not covering liabilities. That's a sign of insolvency. So maybe split on BV Equity/BV Liabilities <=1.

Then, if that's true, maybe bankrupt.

Alternatively, even if equity is less than liabilities, but other factors like high EBIT might help. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Sales/TA. If sales are very low relative to assets (Sales/TA < some value), that's bad.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to think of typical thresholds for bankruptcy prediction.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on Working Capital/TA.

Suppose:

Root node: WC/TA <= threshold (maybe 0.1?)

Wait, perhaps I should think of typical thresholds. For example, in real data, maybe the splits are at certain values that best separate the classes.

Since I can't compute the actual splits, I have to make logical assumptions.

Alternatively, let's think of possible splits in order of importance.

Suppose the most important is Working Capital/TA. If WC/TA is below a certain threshold, say 0.1, then bankruptcy is more likely. Let me try:

First split on WC/TA <= 0.1

- If yes: Then proceed to next split.

- If no: Maybe not bankrupt?

Wait, but maybe if WC/TA is low but not zero, it's still risky.

Alternatively, the first split is on RE/TA <=0:

- RE/TA <=0: Then class is more likely bankrupt. But even then, some companies with negative retained earnings might not have gone bankrupt yet.

Alternatively, the first split is on EBIT/TA <=0: If EBIT is negative (losses), then high chance of bankruptcy.

So first split on EBIT/TA <=0.

If yes: Then check another feature, maybe Sales/TA.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to look at each feature and see which is best for splitting the data into classes.

Assuming that the most important feature is the one that best separates bankrupt from non-bankrupt.

Suppose that the feature with the largest information gain is, say, the Book Value of Equity over Liabilities. Let's assume that if this ratio is below 0.5, the company is more likely to be bankrupt.

So first split on BV Equity/BV Liabilities <=0.5:

- If yes: Bankrupt.

- If no: Proceed.

Alternatively, maybe that's not the first. Let me try a different approach.

Looking at the features again:

- WC/TA: Lower is worse.

- RE/TA: Lower (more negative) worse.

- EBIT/TA: Lower worse.

- Sales/TA: Lower worse.

- BV Equity/BV Liabilities: Lower worse (since equity is less than liabilities).

Each of these ratios being low indicates higher risk.

Suppose the decision tree starts with the most critical feature. Let me think of the Altman Z-Score formula, which uses working capital/total assets, retained earnings/TA, EBIT/TA, sales/TA, and market value of equity. Since we don't have market value, maybe the next important is retained earnings.

In Altman's model, the first term is 1.2*(WC/TA). So WC/TA is important. Maybe starting with WC/TA.

But let me proceed step by step.

Suppose the first split is on WC/TA <= threshold.

Suppose the threshold is say 0.2. If WC/TA is below 0.2, then proceed to check another feature.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on RE/TA <=0.

If RE/TA <=0, then proceed to check another feature, but maybe that's a strong indicator.

Alternatively, let me think of a possible decision tree structure.

Maybe:

First, split on BV Equity/BV Liabilities <=1 (since if equity is less than liabilities, that's a sign of insolvency).

- If yes (<=1), then maybe check another feature, like EBIT/TA.

- If no (>1), then not bankrupt.

But even if equity is less than liabilities, maybe other factors can mitigate. Hmm.

Alternatively, the first split is on EBIT/TA <=0.

If EBIT is negative (EBIT/TA <0), then the company is losing money, so more likely to be bankrupt. So:

Root node: EBIT/TA <=0 ?

- If yes: Then maybe check another feature, like WC/TA.

- If no: Proceed to next split.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Sales/TA <=0.1 (very low sales relative to assets).

This is getting a bit too vague. Maybe I should try to structure a plausible tree with the given features.

Another approach is to think that each split reduces uncertainty. Let's suppose:

First, the most important feature is Working Capital/TA. Suppose the split is at 0.1:

- If WC/TA <=0.1, then bankrupt.

- If >0.1, proceed.

Alternatively, maybe RE/TA is first. Suppose:

Root: RE/TA <= -0.1 (meaning retained earnings are negative and significant). If yes, bankrupt.

If not, proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on BV Equity/BV Liabilities <=0.5.

Suppose:

Root split: BV Equity/BV Liabilities <=0.5

- If yes: Then check another feature like EBIT/TA.

- If no: Probably not bankrupt.

Alternatively, the first split is on EBIT/TA <=-0.1 (EBIT negative).

- If yes: Then maybe check WC/TA.

- If no: Proceed.

This is challenging without data. Maybe I can look for typical splits in bankruptcy models. For example, in the Z-score model, the variables are scaled and combined, but in a decision tree, splits are on individual features.

Alternatively, let me think of an example decision tree structure:

Start with RE/TA.

If RE/TA <=0:

    Then check EBIT/TA.

        If EBIT/TA <=0:

            Then Bankrupt.

        Else:

            Proceed to another feature.

Wait, perhaps a more structured approach:

Suppose the decision tree is as follows:

First split on Working Capital/Total Assets <= threshold.

Suppose the first split is WC/TA <= 0.2

- If yes, then proceed to check another feature like EBIT/TA.

- If no (WC/TA >0.2), then check another feature.

Alternatively, let me try building a possible tree step by step.

1. **Root Node**: Let's pick the most important feature, say **Retained Earnings/Total Assets (RE/TA)**.

   - Split on RE/TA <= 0.0 (since negative retained earnings are bad).

     - **Left Branch (RE/TA <=0)**:
       - Proceed to next split, maybe **Book Value of Equity/BV Liabilities**.
           - Split on BV Equity/BV Liabilities <= 0.5:
               - **Left (<=0.5)**: Class: Bankrupt.
               - **Right (>0.5)**: Maybe check another feature like EBIT/TA.
                   - Split on EBIT/TA <= -0.1 (negative EBIT):
                       - **Left**: Bankrupt.
                       - **Right**: Not Bankrupt.
     - **Right Branch (RE/TA >0)**:
       - Proceed to next feature like **Sales/TA**.
           - Split on Sales/TA <=0.2 (low sales relative to assets):
               - **Left**: Check another feature like WC/TA.
                   - Split WC/TA <=0.1:
                       - **Left**: Bankrupt.
                       - **Right**: Not Bankrupt.
               - **Right (Sales/TA >0.2)**:
                   - Proceed to EBIT/TA.
                       - Split on EBIT/TA <=0:
                           - **Left**: Bankrupt.
                           - **Right**: Not Bankrupt.

Hmm, this is getting complex, but maybe that's the way. Alternatively, perhaps a simpler tree.

Alternatively, let me try a different structure:

**Root Split**: **Book Value of Equity/BV Liabilities** <=1

- **Left Branch (<=1)**:
   - Split on **EBIT/TA** <=0:
       - **Left**: Bankrupt.
       - **Right**: Split on **WC/TA** <=0.1:
           - **Left**: Bankrupt.
           - **Right**: Not Bankrupt.
- **Right Branch (>1)**:
   - Split on **Sales/TA** <=0.1:
       - **Left**: Check WC/TA.
           - Split WC/TA <=0.1:
               - **Left**: Bankrupt.
               - **Right**: Not Bankrupt.
       - **Right**: Not Bankrupt.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on EBIT/TA <=0. If EBIT is negative, they might be bankrupt.

Root: EBIT/TA <=0

- **Left (EBIT negative)**:
   - Split on WC/TA <=0:
       - **Left**: Bankrupt.
       - **Right**: Split on BV Equity/BV Liabilities <=0.5:
           - **Left**: Bankrupt.
           - **Right**: Not Bankrupt (maybe they still have some equity).
- **Right (EBIT positive)**:
   - Split on RE/TA <=-0.1 (negative retained earnings but EBIT positive? Maybe conflicting):
       - **Left (RE negative)**:
           - Split on Sales/TA <=0.2:
               - **Left**: Bankrupt.
               - **Right**: Not Bankrupt.
       - **Right (RE positive)**:
           - Not Bankrupt.

Hmm, not sure. Maybe the most straightforward approach is to start with the most critical feature, like Working Capital/TA, then proceed.

Alternatively, here's a possible structure based on common factors:

1. **First Split**: **Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA)** <=0.2

   - If **Yes (WC/TA <=0.2)**:
     - Check **Retained Earnings/TA (RE/TA)** <=-0.1
         - If **Yes (RE/TA <=-0.1)**:
             - Class: Bankrupt
         - If **No (RE/TA >-0.1)**:
             - Check **EBIT/TA** <=0
                 - If **Yes (EBIT negative)**:
                     - Class: Bankrupt
                 - If **No**:
                     - Check **Sales/TA** <=0.2
                         - If **Yes (low sales)**:
                             - Class: Bankrupt
                         - If **No**:
                             - Class: Not Bankrupt

   - If **No (WC/TA >0.2)**:
     - Check **Book Value Equity/Liabilities** <=1
         - If **Yes**:
             - Class: Bankrupt
         - If **No**:
             - Class: Not Bankrupt

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the Book Value Equity/Liabilities ratio. Let me try:

**Root**: **Book Value of Equity/BV Liabilities** <=1

- **Left (<=1)**:
   - Split on **EBIT/TA** <=0:
       - **Left (EBIT negative)**:
           - Split on **WC/TA** <=0.1:
               - **Left**: Bankrupt
               - **Right**: Check **Sales/TA** <=0.2
                   - **Left**: Bankrupt
                   - **Right**: Not Bankrupt
       - **Right (EBIT positive)**:
           - Split on **RE/TA** <=-0.1:
               - **Left (RE negative)**:
                   - Class: Bankrupt
               - **Right (RE positive)**:
                   - Class: Not Bankrupt
- **Right (>1)**:
   - Class: Not Bankrupt (since equity is sufficient)

This might make sense because if equity is less than liabilities (<=1), the company is more at risk, then further splits based on profitability and liquidity.

Alternatively, a simpler tree:

1. **Root**: **Retained Earnings/TA (RE/TA)** <=0

   - **Yes**: High risk
     - Split on **EBIT/TA** <=0
         - **Yes (EBIT negative)**:
             - Class: Bankrupt
         - **No (EBIT positive)**:
             - Split on **WC/TA** <=0.2
                 - **Yes**: Bankrupt
                 - **No**: Not Bankrupt
   - **No (RE positive)**:
     - Split on **Book Value Equity/Liabilities** <=1
         - **Yes**: 
             - Split on **Sales/TA** <=0.3
                 - **Yes**: Bankrupt
                 - **No**: Not Bankrupt
         - **No**: Not Bankrupt

This way, companies with negative retained earnings are first checked for EBIT and working capital, while those with positive retained earnings but low equity relative to liabilities are checked for sales.

I think the key features here are RE/TA, EBIT/TA, WC/TA, and BV Equity/BV Liabilities. Sales might be a secondary factor.

Given that the question asks for a decision tree structure using these features, perhaps the simplest plausible structure could be:

- Root: **Book Value of Equity / BV Liabilities** <= 1
   - Yes: 
      - Split on **EBIT/TA** <= 0
         - Yes: Bankrupt
         - No: 
             - Split on **WC/TA** <= 0.2
                 - Yes: Bankrupt
                 - No: Not Bankrupt
   - No (BV Equity/BV Liabilities >1): Not Bankrupt

But perhaps adding more splits:

Alternatively:

Root: **Retained Earnings / TA** <= -0.1

- Yes (Negative RE):
   - Split on **EBIT/TA** <=0
      - Yes (Negative EBIT): Bankrupt
      - No (Positive EBIT):
          - Split on **WC/TA** <= 0.1
             - Yes: Bankrupt
             - No: Not Bankrupt
- No (RE > -0.1):
   - Split on **Book Value Equity/Liabilities** <=1
      - Yes (Equity < Liabilities):
          - Split on **Sales/TA** <=0.2
              - Yes: Bankrupt
              - No: Not Bankrupt
      - No: Not Bankrupt

This structure considers both negative retained earnings and equity position.

Given that I need to provide a clear answer, perhaps a more straightforward tree:

**Decision Tree Structure:**

1. **First Split**: **Book Value of Equity / BV Liabilities** ≤ 1.0
   - **If Yes** (Equity is less than or equal to liabilities):
     - **Second Split**: **EBIT/TA** ≤ 0.0
       - **If Yes** (Negative EBIT): **Class: Bankrupt**
       - **If No** (Positive EBIT):
         - **Third Split**: **Working Capital/TA** ≤ 0.2
           - **If Yes** (Low Working Capital): **Class: Bankrupt**
           - **If No**: **Class: Not Bankrupt**
   - **If No** (Equity > Liabilities): **Class: Not Bankrupt**

This tree first checks the equity position. If equity is insufficient, it then checks profitability (EBIT). If still in trouble, it looks at working capital. If equity is sufficient, the company is deemed not bankrupt.

Alternatively, another version considering more splits:

**Decision Tree Structure:**

1. **Root Node**: **Retained Earnings/TA (RE/TA)** ≤ -0.1
   - **Yes** (Negative Retained Earnings):
     - **Next Node**: **EBIT/TA** ≤ 0.0
       - **Yes** (Negative EBIT): **Class: Bankrupt**
       - **No** (Positive EBIT):
         - **Next Node**: **Working Capital/TA** ≤ 0.2
           - **Yes** (Low Working Capital): **Class: Bankrupt**
           - **No**: **Class: Not Bankrupt**
   - **No** (RE/TA > -0.1):
     - **Next Node**: **Book Value Equity/BV Liabilities** ≤ 1.0
       - **Yes** (Equity ≤ Liabilities):
         - **Next Node**: **Sales/TA** ≤ 0.2
           - **Yes** (Low Sales): **Class: Bankrupt**
           - **No**: **Class: Not Bankrupt**
       - **No** (Equity > Liabilities): **Class: Not Bankrupt**

This tree first checks retained earnings, then EBIT, working capital, equity position, and sales.

Given that the user might expect a concise yet logical structure, perhaps the first structure is better.

**Final Answer:**

The decision tree structure for determining bankruptcy using the given features is as follows:

1. **First Split**: **Book Value of Equity / BV Liabilities** ≤ 1.0
   - **If Yes**:
     - **Second Split**: **EBIT/TA** ≤ 0.0
       - **If Yes**: **Bankrupt**
       - **If No**:
         - **Third Split**: **Working Capital/TA** ≤ 0.2
           - **If Yes**: **Bankrupt**
           - **If No**: **Not Bankrupt**
   - **If No**: **Not Bankrupt**

\boxed{
\begin{array}{l}
\text{1. If Book Value of Equity/BV Liabilities $\leq$ 1.0:} \\
\quad \text{2. If EBIT/TA $\leq$ 0.0: Bankrupt} \\
\quad \text{Else:} \\
\quad \quad \text{3. If Working Capital/TA $\leq$ 0.2: Bankrupt} \\
\quad \quad \text{Else: Not Bankrupt} \\
\text{Else: Not Bankrupt}
\end{array}
}

<think>
Okay, I need to create a Python function that acts as a decision tree based on the given features for predicting company bankruptcy. The function should return the prediction and a list indicating which inner nodes were true (1) or false (0). 

First, let's recall the features provided: WC/TA, RE/TA, EBIT/TA, S/TA, BVE/BVL, and the target is 'target' (0 or 1). The user mentioned that the decision tree structure isn't provided, so I need to come up with a plausible structure. Since there's no existing tree, I'll have to make some educated guesses based on common financial ratios related to bankruptcy prediction.

Common financial indicators for bankruptcy might include high debt (low WC/TA, maybe?), low profitability (low EBIT/TA), etc. Let me think of possible splits. 

Maybe start with S/TA (Sales over Total Assets). High sales could indicate a healthier company. Suppose if S/TA is below a threshold, that's a risk. Let's pick a threshold, maybe 0.1? 

Then, perhaps next split on EBIT/TA. If EBIT/TA is too low, that's bad. Let's say 0.05 as a threshold.

Another node might be RE/TA (Retained Earnings over Total Assets). If retained earnings are negative (RE/TA < 0?), that's a problem. 

The BVE/BVL (Book Value Equity over Liabilities) ratio—if that's below 1, it might indicate liabilities exceed equity, which is risky. So maybe a threshold of 1.

WC/TA (Working Capital over Total Assets) should be positive. If WC/TA is negative, that's a red flag. Threshold 0?

Putting this together into a decision tree structure. Let's try to outline a possible tree:

Root node: S/TA <= 0.1 → if yes, go left (riskier path), else right (safer). 

If S/TA is low (left), then check EBIT/TA. Suppose next split on EBIT/TA <=0.05. If yes (low earnings), predict bankruptcy (1). Else, check another feature.

Alternatively, maybe after S/TA, the next split is on RE/TA. Let's see.

Alternatively, here's a possible structure:

Node 0: S/TA <= 0.1 → if yes, proceed to Node 1; else, Node 2.

Node 1: EBIT/TA <= 0.05 → if yes, predict 1 (bankrupt), else check another node.

Wait, perhaps:

First, the root is S/TA. Let me structure it step by step.

Suppose the tree is structured like this:

- Root: S/TA <= 0.1 → if yes, go left; else right.

Left branch (S/TA low):

   Next split on EBIT/TA <= 0.05 → if yes (low earnings), predict 1 (bankrupt). 

   If EBIT/TA >0.05, then check BVE/BVL. Suppose BVE/BVL <=1 → if yes, then maybe bankrupt (1), else 0?

Alternatively, maybe after S/TA and EBIT, next split on WC/TA <0 (negative working capital). 

This is getting a bit vague. Since the user didn't provide the actual tree structure, I need to make up a plausible one. Let's try to come up with a tree with 5 nodes as in the example.

Wait the example had 5 nodes, but in the code, there were 5 nodes. Maybe the user expects a similar structure. Let me see the example code again.

The example function had nodes[0] to nodes[4], and the structure was nested ifs. So perhaps the decision tree has 5 nodes, each representing a condition. The nodes list is of length 5, each entry is a boolean.

So, the function needs to have 5 nodes, each corresponding to a condition on one of the features, with thresholds.

Now, let me try to create a decision tree with 5 nodes. Let's think of possible splits:

Node 0: S/TA <= 0.1 → if yes, proceed to node 1.

Node 1: RE/TA <= 0.0 → maybe retained earnings negative? If yes, then node 2.

Node 2: EBIT/TA <= 0.03 → if yes, predict 1.

Alternatively, maybe:

Node0: WC/TA <= 0 → if yes (negative working capital), then bankrupt (1). But that might be too direct. Maybe it's part of a deeper split.

Alternatively, let's try to think of a simple 5-node tree:

Suppose the tree is structured as follows:

Root (Node 0): WC/TA <= 0.2 → if yes, go left.

Wait, let me think again. Let me try to create a structure similar to the example given. The example's code had 5 nodes, and the code structure was nested if-else.

Perhaps the decision tree is:

- Node0: S/TA <= 0.1 → left branch (True), right (False)

If Node0 is True (S/TA low), then Node1: RE/TA <=0.0 → if yes, then Node2: EBIT/TA <=0.05 → yes leads to 1, else maybe other nodes.

Alternatively, perhaps:

Node0: S/TA <= 0.1 → if yes, then Node1: RE/TA <=0 → yes → predict 1 (bankrupt), else Node2: EBIT/TA <=0.05 → yes → 1, else 0.

Wait, but that may not use all 5 nodes. Let me try to make a tree with 5 nodes.

Let me try a tree with 5 nodes:

Structure:

Node0: S/TA <= 0.1 → if yes, go to Node1; else, go to Node2.

Node1: EBIT/TA <= 0.05 → if yes, go to Node3; else, Node4.

Node2: BVE/BVL <=1 → if yes, go to Node3; else, Node4.

Wait not sure. Alternatively:

The nodes list will have 5 conditions. Let me think of a path where each condition branches.

Here's a possible path:

Node0: S/TA <=0.1 → if yes → Node1; else → Node2.

Node1: WC/TA <=0.2 → yes → Node3 (maybe predict 1); else → Node4.

Node2: RE/TA <=0 → yes → Node3; else → Node4.

Wait but how to structure this in code with 5 nodes. Alternatively, maybe the nodes are in a linear path.

Alternatively, here's a possible structure:

The nodes are numbered 0 to 4, and the conditions are structured as follows:

- Node0: S/TA <= 0.1 → if True, next check Node1; else Node2.

- Node1: RE/TA <=0 → if yes (True), then Node3 (another condition?), else Node4?

Hmm, perhaps I should think of the example's code structure. The example had 5 nodes and the code used if-else nesting. Let me try to mirror that structure but with the given features.

Let me try to construct the code step by step.

Suppose the first node (nodes[0]) is a condition on S/TA. Let's say:

nodes[0] = X['S/TA'] <= 0.1

Then, if that's true, we go into an if block. The next node (nodes[1]) could be on another feature, say EBIT/TA <= 0.03.

nodes[1] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.03

Then, if nodes[0] and nodes[1], proceed further. Maybe the third node (nodes[2]) is on RE/TA, like RE/TA <= 0.0:

nodes[2] = X['RE/TA'] <= 0.0

Then, if nodes[0], nodes[1], and nodes[2], then maybe nodes[3] checks BVE/BVL, like BVE/BVL <=1.0:

nodes[3] = X['BVE/BVL'] <= 1.0

If that's true, then maybe nodes[4], which could be WC/TA <= 0.0:

nodes[4] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.0

But how to structure the prediction. Alternatively, perhaps the nodes are arranged so that each level of the if-else uses a node.

Alternatively, perhaps the nodes are as follows:

The decision tree could be structured like this:

Start at node0 (S/TA <= 0.1). If yes, go to node1 (RE/TA <=0.0). If yes, then node2 (EBIT/TA <=0.05). If yes, predict 1. Else, maybe node3.

Alternatively, here's a possible code outline:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [0]  # initializing list with 5 elements, then set each condition's truth value

    nodes[0] = X['S/TA'] <= 0.1
    nodes[1] = X['RE/TA'] <= 0.0
    nodes[2] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05
    nodes[3] = X['BVE/BVL'] <= 1.0
    nodes[4] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.2  # some threshold, maybe 0.2 is a reasonable value.

    # Now, the decision logic:

    if nodes[0]:  # S/TA low
        if nodes[1]:  # RE negative
            if nodes[2]:  # EBIT low
                if nodes[3]:  # BVE/BVL low (maybe liabilities > equity)
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:
            if nodes[4]:  # WC/TA low (maybe negative)
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:  # S/TA high
        if nodes[3]:  # BVE/BVL <=1 (bad)
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but I need to structure the if-else correctly. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the path goes through each node in order. Let me see the example code again. In the example, the code uses a series of nested ifs based on the nodes. For instance:

In the example:

if nodes[0]:
    if nodes[1]:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[3]:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    # etc.

So following that structure, perhaps the nodes are arranged in a path. Let me try to design that.

Let's say the first node is S/TA <=0.1 → if true, then proceed to node1 (RE/TA <=0.0), then node2 (EBIT/TA <=0.05), etc.

Alternatively, here's a possible structure with 5 nodes:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['S/TA'] <= 0.1  # Sales to Total Assets low
    nodes[1] = X['RE/TA'] <= 0.0  # Retained Earnings negative
    nodes[2] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05  # Low EBIT
    nodes[3] = X['BVE/BVL'] <= 1.0  # Equity less than liabilities
    nodes[4] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.0  # Negative working capital

    if nodes[0]:  # S/TA low
        if nodes[1]:  # RE negative
            if nodes[2]:  # EBIT low
                if nodes[3]:  # BVE/BVL low
                    if nodes[4]:  # WC negative → high risk
                        prediction = 1
                    else:
                        prediction = 1  # Still risky?
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Maybe BVE/BVL is okay despite others?
            else:
                prediction = 0  # EBIT okay → not bankrupt
        else:  # RE positive
            if nodes[4]:  # WC negative → maybe still risky
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:  # S/TA high → healthier
        if nodes[3]:  # BVE/BVL <=1 → liabilities exceed equity → risk
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

Hmm, but this might not use all nodes in all paths. Alternatively, perhaps I need to structure it so that each node is checked in some path.

Alternatively, let's make sure all nodes are part of the decision path. Let me think of a different structure. Let me try to write the code with 5 nodes in a nested structure, similar to the example.

Suppose the nodes are used as follows:

nodes[0] = S/TA <= 0.1 → first condition

nodes[1] = RE/TA <= 0.0 → second condition after nodes[0] is true.

nodes[2] = EBIT/TA <=0.05 → after nodes[1].

nodes[3] = BVE/BVL <=1.0 → after nodes[2].

nodes[4] = WC/TA <=0.0 → after nodes[3].

Then, the code would be:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5*[0]
    nodes[0] = X['S/TA'] <= 0.1
    nodes[1] = X['RE/TA'] <= 0.0
    nodes[2] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05
    nodes[3] = X['BVE/BVL'] <= 1.0
    nodes[4] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.0

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1
                    else:
                        prediction = 0
                else:
                    prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but this might not be the most logical. Let me think of another way.

Alternatively, perhaps the nodes are arranged in a way that each level of if-else uses a node:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [False]*5  # Initialize all to False
    nodes[0] = (X['S/TA'] <= 0.1)
    nodes[1] = (X['RE/TA'] <= 0.0)
    nodes[2] = (X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05)
    nodes[3] = (X['BVE/BVL'] <= 1.0)
    nodes[4] = (X['WC/TA'] <= 0.0)

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

Hmm, this is getting a bit convoluted. Perhaps I need to choose thresholds that make sense.

Alternatively, let me think of a simple decision tree with 5 nodes that uses all nodes in some path. Let's try:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [False]*5
    nodes[0] = X['S/TA'] <= 0.1
    nodes[1] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05
    nodes[2] = X['RE/TA'] <= 0.0
    nodes[3] = X['BVE/BVL'] <= 1.0
    nodes[4] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.2

    if nodes[0]: # Low sales
        if nodes[1]: # Low EBIT
            if nodes[2]: # Negative retained earnings
                prediction = 1
            else:
                if nodes[3]: # BVE/BVL <=1 → equity < liabilities
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
        else: # EBIT okay
            prediction = 0
    else: # Sales okay
        if nodes[3]: # BVE/BVL <=1 → risk
            if nodes[4]: # WC low (maybe negative)
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

This uses all nodes except node2 and node4 in some paths, but perhaps this is acceptable. Alternatively, I need to ensure all nodes are part of the decision.

Alternatively, perhaps the following structure:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [False]*5
    nodes[0] = X['S/TA'] <= 0.1
    nodes[1] = X['RE/TA'] <= 0.0
    nodes[2] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05
    nodes[3] = X['BVE/BVL'] <= 1.0
    nodes[4] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.0

    if nodes[0]:  # S/TA low
        if nodes[1]:  # RE negative
            if nodes[2]:  # EBIT low
                if nodes[3]:  # BVE/BVL low
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:  # RE positive
            if nodes[3]:  # BVE/BVL low
                if nodes[4]:  # WC negative
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:  # S/TA high
        if nodes[3]:  # BVE/BVL low
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

This uses all nodes except node4 in some paths, but perhaps that's okay. Alternatively, maybe node4 is used in another path.

Alternatively, in the else clause of node0, perhaps check node4:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [False]*5
    nodes[0] = X['S/TA'] <= 0.1
    nodes[1] = X['RE/TA'] <= 0.0
    nodes[2] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05
    nodes[3] = X['BVE/BVL'] <= 1.0
    nodes[4] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.0

    if nodes[0]:  # S/TA low
        if nodes[1]:  # RE negative
            if nodes[2]:  # EBIT low
                if nodes[3]:  # BVE/BVL <=1
                    if nodes[4]:  # WC negative
                        prediction = 1
                    else:
                        prediction = 1  # still risky?
                else:
                    prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:  # RE positive
            if nodes[3]:  # BVE/BVL <=1
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:  # S/TA high
        if nodes[3]:  # BVE/BVL <=1 → risk
            if nodes[4]:  # WC negative → risk
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

This way, all nodes except node2 in some paths are used. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps nodes[2] (EBIT/TA <=0.05) is part of another path.

Alternatively, let's try to structure it so that each node is part of the decision path in some branch.

Perhaps the following code:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [False]*5
    nodes[0] = X['S/TA'] <= 0.1
    nodes[1] = X['RE/TA'] <= 0.0
    nodes[2] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05
    nodes[3] = X['BVE/BVL'] <= 1.0
    nodes[4] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.0

    if nodes[0]:  # S/TA low
        if nodes[1]:  # RE negative
            if nodes[2]:  # EBIT low
                if nodes[3]:  # BVE/BVL <=1 → equity < liab
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:  # RE positive
            if nodes[3]:  # BVE/BVL <=1
                if nodes[4]:  # WC negative
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:  # S/TA high
        if nodes[3]:  # BVE/BVL <=1 → risk
            if nodes[2]:  # EBIT low
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

This uses all nodes except node4 in the else clause for S/TA high, but in the else clause for S/TA high, we check node3 and node2.

Hmm. It's a bit tricky, but maybe this is acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can be structured as follows, ensuring all nodes are used in at least one path:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [False]*5
    nodes[0] = X['S/TA'] <= 0.1
    nodes[1] = X['RE/TA'] <= 0.0
    nodes[2] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05
    nodes[3] = X['BVE/BVL'] <= 1.0
    nodes[4] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.0

    if nodes[0]:  # S/TA low
        if nodes[1]:  # RE negative
            if nodes[2]:  # EBIT low
                if nodes[3]:  # BVE/BVL low
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
            else:
                if nodes[4]:  # WC negative
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
        else:  # RE positive
            if nodes[3]:  # BVE/BVL low
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:  # S/TA high
        if nodes[3]:  # BVE/BVL low
            if nodes[2]:  # EBIT low
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:
            if nodes[4]:  # WC negative
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

This way, all nodes are used in at least one path. For example:

- nodes[0] is checked in the first condition.

- nodes[1] is checked in the second condition under nodes[0].

- nodes[2] is checked under nodes[0] and nodes[1], and also under the else of nodes[0].

- nodes[3] is checked in multiple places.

- nodes[4] is checked under nodes[0], nodes[1], and in the else of nodes[3].

This ensures all nodes are used in some path.

Now, the thresholds like 0.1, 0.05, 1.0, 0.0 are chosen arbitrarily. In a real scenario, these would be determined by a model, but for the purpose of creating an example, these can be set as such.

Therefore, the final function would look something like the above, with proper indentation and structure.
