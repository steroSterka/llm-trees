Alright, so the user wants me to build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 using the given financial features. The goal is to classify whether a company went bankrupt or not.

First, I need to understand the features provided:

1. Working Capital/Total Assets (WC_TA)
2. Retained Earnings/Total Assets (RE_TA)
3. Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets (EBIT_TA)
4. Sales/Total Assets (Sales_TA)
5. Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities (Equity_Liabilities)

I remember that decision trees work by selecting the best feature to split the data at each node, aiming for the highest information gain.

Since the tree can have a maximum depth of 2, it means there will be one root node and up to two levels. So, I'll need to choose the first feature to split on, then each subsequent split from that will be limited.

I should consider which financial ratios are most indicative of bankruptcy. Typically, WC_TA indicates liquidity; lower values might suggest cash flow problems. RE_TA shows profitability and reinvestment ability; if it's negative or too low, it could signal issues. EBIT_TA is a measure of profitability, so lower would be worse. Sales_TA can indicate revenue generation capabilities. Equity_Liabilities ratio reflects the company's leverage; a lower value means more debt relative to equity.

I think EBIT_TA might be a strong indicator because profitability is crucial for sustainability. So, perhaps starting with EBIT_TA as the root node makes sense.

Let me outline possible splits:

1. Root: EBIT_TA <= X
   - If yes, maybe high risk of bankruptcy.
   - If no, then check another feature at the next level.

Now, what threshold X should I choose? In decision trees, this is often determined by information gain or Gini impurity reduction. But without data, it's hard to compute exact thresholds. So, I might have to approximate based on typical values or use median/mode splits.

Next, after splitting on EBIT_TA, for the nodes where EBIT_TA > X, I need another feature to further split. Maybe Equity_Liabilities ratio? A lower ratio indicates higher debt, so perhaps setting a threshold there would be useful.

Putting it together:

Root: EBIT_TA <= 0.05 (assuming this is a common threshold indicating low profitability)
- If yes, class: bankrupt
- Else:
   - Split on Equity_Liabilities >= 1.50 (indicating healthier equity position)
       - If yes, class: non-bankrupt
       - Else, class: bankrupt

Alternatively, maybe the first split should be on a different feature like RE_TA because retained earnings can show if a company is struggling over time.

Wait, but EBIT_TA directly relates to current profitability, which might be more immediate. So I'll stick with that.

I need to ensure each path is clear and that the tree doesn't exceed depth 2. Each node after the root should have up to two children, making a total of three leaves: bankrupt, non-bankrupt, and another bankrupt from the second split.

So, the structure would be:

- EBIT_TA <= threshold
   - class: bankrupt
- Else:
   - Equity_Liabilities >= threshold? If yes, non-bankrupt; else, bankrupt

I think this makes sense. It uses two splits with the most important features and classifies accordingly.

Hereâ€™s a decision tree for bankruptcy classification based on the provided financial features. The tree has a maximum depth of 2:

|--- Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets (EBIT_TA) <= 0.05  
||--- class: bankrupt  
|--- Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets (EBIT_TA) > 0.05  
||--- Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities (Equity_Liabilities) >= 1.50  
|||--- class: non-bankrupt  
||--- Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities (Equity_Liabilities) < 1.50  
|||--- class: bankrupt  

### Explanation:
1. **Root Node**: The tree splits on the feature *Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets (EBIT_TA)*, which is a key indicator of profitability. A threshold of 0.05 was chosen to separate companies with very low profitability.
   - If `EBIT_TA <= 0.05`, the company is classified as bankrupt because its profitability is too low to sustain operations.
   - If `EBIT_TA > 0.05`, the tree proceeds to evaluate the second feature.

2. **Second Split**: For companies with `EBIT_TA > 0.05`, the tree evaluates *Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities (Equity_Liabilities)*, which reflects the company's leverage and financial health.
   - If `Equity_Liabilities >= 1.50`, the company is classified as non-bankrupt because it has a healthy equity-to-liabilities ratio, indicating lower financial risk.
   - If `Equity_Liabilities < 1.50`, the company is classified as bankrupt because its high debt relative to equity suggests financial distress.

This decision tree uses two of the most important features to classify companies into "bankrupt" or "non-bankrupt" with a maximum depth of 2.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 that predicts whether a company went bankrupt based on the given financial features. Additionally, I need to format this decision tree as a Python function that returns both a prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

First, let's understand the features provided:

1. **WC/TA**: Working Capital/Total Assets - Indicates liquidity.
2. **RE/TA**: Retained Earnings/Total Assets - Shows profitability and reinvestment ability.
3. **EBIT/TA**: Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets - Measures operational efficiency.
4. **S/TA**: Sales/Total Assets - Reflects sales performance relative to assets.
5. **BVE/BVL**: Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities - Indicates financial leverage.

The target variable is 'target', where 0 means the company did not go bankrupt, and 1 means it did.

Given that we need a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, this implies that there will be at most two levels of decisions (i.e., two internal nodes). The function should return both the predicted class (0 or 1) and a list of truth values corresponding to the conditions checked at each inner node.

To start, I'll outline the structure of the decision tree. Since depth is limited to 2, there will be one root node, which splits into two children nodes, each leading to leaf nodes. The challenge here is selecting the most informative features and appropriate thresholds for splitting.

For simplicity, let's choose **EBIT/TA** as the first split (root node). Companies with higher EBIT/TA are generally more profitable and less likely to go bankrupt. I'll set a threshold, say 0.1, meaning if EBIT/TA is greater than or equal to 0.1, we predict the company didn't go bankrupt.

Next, for companies that don't meet this condition (EBIT/TA < 0.1), we'll use another feature as the second split. A logical choice here could be **BVE/BVL**, which indicates the company's equity relative to liabilities. A higher BVE/BVL suggests better financial health. Let's set a threshold of 1.0, meaning if BVE/BVL is greater than or equal to 1.0, we predict the company didn't go bankrupt.

Now, translating this structure into a Python function:

- The function will take a dictionary `X` with the feature keys.
- It will evaluate the first condition (EBIT/TA >= 0.1) and store it in `nodes[0]`.
- For cases where `nodes[0]` is False, it will evaluate the second condition (BVE/BVL >= 1.0) and store it in `nodes[1]`.
- Based on these evaluations, the function will return a prediction of bankruptcy (1 if conditions are met, otherwise 0) and the list of node evaluations.

I need to ensure that the keys for the features match exactly as provided ('EBIT/TA', 'BVE/BVL') and that the thresholds are set based on typical values seen in financial data. If these thresholds are not meaningful, they can be adjusted based on actual data distribution.

Finally, I'll test this function with sample inputs to verify its correctness.
</think>

Here's a Python function implementing the decision tree as described:

```python
def predict(X: dict) -> tuple[int, list[bool]]:
    nodes = [None] * 2
    
    # First condition (root node): EBIT/TA >= 0.1
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] >= 0.1
    
    if not nodes[0]:
        # Second condition: BVE/BVL >= 1.0
        nodes[1] = X['BVE/BVL'] >= 1.0
    
    # Determine the prediction based on node evaluations
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Company did not go bankrupt
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Company did not go bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Company went bankrupt
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
sample_input = {
    'EBIT/TA': 0.05,
    'BVE/BVL': 0.8
}

prediction, nodes = predict(sample_input)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes evaluations: {nodes}")
```

This function first checks if the EBIT/TA ratio is above a certain threshold (indicating better financial health). If it's below that threshold, it then evaluates the BVE/BVL ratio to further assess the company's solvency. The function returns both the predicted outcome and the evaluations of the decision nodes for transparency.
