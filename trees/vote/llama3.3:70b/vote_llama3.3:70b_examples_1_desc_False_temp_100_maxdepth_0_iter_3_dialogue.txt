To build a decision tree that classifies party affiliation based on the provided features (votes on various issues), we'll use a simplified approach since the actual data and its complexity are not fully represented here. In real-world scenarios, you would typically use a dataset where each row represents a politician's votes across these issues, along with their known party affiliation, to train a model like a decision tree classifier.

Given the features:
1. Vote on the issue of handicapped infants (yes / no)
2. Vote on water project cost sharing (yes / no)
3. Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (yes / no)
4. Vote on physician fee freeze (yes / no)
5. Vote on aid to El Salvador (yes / no)
6. Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (yes / no)
7. Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes / no)
8. Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no)
9. Vote on MX missile (yes / no)
10. Vote on immigration (yes / no)
11. Vote on synfuels corporation cutback (yes / no)
12. Vote on education spending (yes / no)
13. Vote on superfund right to sue (yes / no)
14. Vote on crime (yes / no)
15. Vote on duty-free exports (yes / no)
16. Vote on Export Administration Act - South Africa (yes / no)

And the target variable: Party Affiliation (Democrat or Republican)

Without actual data, we can hypothesize which votes might be most indicative of party affiliation based on historical context and then construct a simplified decision tree.

**Step 1: Choose the Most Important Features**
Historically, certain issues have been more divisive along party lines. For example:
- Aid to El Salvador and aid to Nicaraguan contras were highly politicized during the Cold War era, with Republicans generally supporting such interventions and Democrats opposing them.
- Votes on budget resolutions can also be very partisan, with Democrats often favoring more social spending and Republicans advocating for reduced government spending.

**Step 2: Construct a Simplified Decision Tree**

Let's simplify by focusing on three potentially divisive issues:
1. Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras
2. Vote on adoption of the budget resolution
3. Vote on education spending

Decision Tree:
|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras = yes
||--- class: Republican (Given historical context, a yes vote here was more likely from Republicans)
|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras = no
||--- Vote on adoption of the budget resolution = yes
|||--- Vote on education spending = yes
||||--- class: Democrat (Favoring social spending and opposing interventions aligns with Democratic stances)
|||--- Vote on education spending = no
||||--- class: Republican (Opposing increased education spending could be seen as a more conservative stance)
||--- Vote on adoption of the budget resolution = no
|||--- class: Republican (Opposing the budget, potentially due to its perceived liberal spending, aligns with a Republican stance)

This simplified tree makes broad assumptions and does not account for individual variations or changes in party platforms over time. In reality, decision trees are constructed using algorithms that analyze actual data to determine splits based on information gain or Gini impurity reduction.

**Important Note:** This is a highly hypothetical and simplified example intended to demonstrate how one might approach building a decision tree with given features. Real-world applications require a comprehensive dataset and careful consideration of the complex interactions between political issues and affiliations.

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting party affiliation based on votes on various issues. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input where keys are feature names and values are corresponding vote outcomes.

```python
def predict_party_affiliation(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) based on votes on various issues.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing features with their respective vote outcomes.
             Keys should match the exact feature names provided, and values should be either 1 (no) or 2 (yes).
    
    Returns:
    prediction (int): Predicted party affiliation (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican)
    nodes (list): List of truth values for inner nodes in the decision tree
    """
    # Initialize list to store node outcomes
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras
    nodes[0] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2
    
    # Node 2: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution if Node 1 is False
    nodes[1] = (X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2) if not nodes[0] else None
    
    # Node 3: Vote on education spending if Node 2 is True and Node 1 is False
    nodes[2] = (X["education spending"] == 2) if (not nodes[0] and nodes[1]) else None
    
    # Make prediction based on node outcomes
    if nodes[0]:  # Yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras, likely Republican
        prediction = 1
    elif nodes[1]:  # Voted for budget resolution after not supporting Nicaraguan contras
        if nodes[2]:  # Also voted for education spending
            prediction = 0  # Likely Democrat given support for social spending
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Otherwise, likely Republican due to budget vote alignment
    else:  # Did not vote for aid to Nicaraguan contras or budget resolution
        prediction = 0  # Defaulting to Democrat without clear indicators
    
    # Replace None values in nodes list with 0 (False) to maintain consistency
    nodes = [int(node) if node is not None else 0 for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
example_votes = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 1,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 1,
    "el salvador aid": 2,
    "religious groups in schools": 1,
    "anti satellite test ban": 2,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 2,
    "mx missile": 2,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 2,
    "education spending": 2,
    "superfund right to sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 1,
    "export administration act south africa": 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict_party_affiliation(example_votes)
print(f"Predicted Party Affiliation: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Node Outcomes: {nodes}")
```

This code implements a simplified decision tree that uses votes on aid to Nicaraguan contras, adoption of the budget resolution, and education spending as key factors in predicting party affiliation. It returns both the predicted affiliation (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and a list representing the outcomes of inner nodes in the decision-making process.
