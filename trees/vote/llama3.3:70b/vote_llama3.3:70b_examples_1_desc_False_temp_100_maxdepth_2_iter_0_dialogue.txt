To induce a decision tree classifier with the given features that classify party affiliation as either Democrat or Republican, we first need to understand that the provided example uses features related to flowers (sepal and petal dimensions) to classify species. However, our task involves using voting records on various issues to predict political party affiliation.

Given the complexity of the problem and the nature of the features (binary votes on various issues), a decision tree can be a powerful tool for classification. The goal is to build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, focusing on the most important features that distinguish between Democrats and Republicans based on their voting patterns.

### Step 1: Feature Selection
To simplify, let's select the top few features that are likely to differentiate Democrats from Republicans significantly. Without actual data, we can hypothesize based on typical party line issues:

- Vote on aid to El Salvador (yes / no)
- Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes / no)
- Vote on MX missile (yes / no)

These issues often have clear partisan divides in the context of historical U.S. politics.

### Step 2: Building the Decision Tree
With a maximum depth of 2, our tree will have one root node and two levels of child nodes. The root node represents the first feature used for splitting, and each subsequent level represents further splits based on additional features.

#### Root Node: Vote on aid to El Salvador (yes / no)
- **Yes**: Tends to be more associated with Republican votes due to historical contexts of U.S. involvement in Central America.
- **No**: More aligned with Democratic positions, given their general stance on foreign interventions.

#### First Level Nodes:
- **Vote on aid to El Salvador = Yes**
  - **Vote on MX missile (yes / no)**: 
    - **Yes**: Likely Republican, as support for military spending is often higher among Republicans.
    - **No**: Could be either, but given the first vote, might lean slightly Republican or be a more moderate Democrat not aligned with typical party lines on defense.
- **Vote on aid to El Salvador = No**
  - **Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes / no)**:
    - **Yes**: Likely Democrat, as Democrats often support arms control and international cooperation measures.
    - **No**: Could indicate a more hawkish stance, possibly Republican or a conservative Democrat.

### Decision Tree Representation
```
|--- Vote on aid to El Salvador = Yes
||--- Vote on MX missile = Yes
|||--- Class: Republican
||--- Vote on MX missile = No
|||--- Class: Moderate/Undecided (Could require further features for clear classification)
|--- Vote on aid to El Salvador = No
||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban = Yes
|||--- Class: Democrat
||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban = No
|||--- Class: Conservative Democrat or Republican (Further clarification needed)
```

### Note:
This decision tree is a simplified example based on hypothetical voting patterns and does not reflect actual data. Real-world application would require analyzing historical voting records to accurately determine which issues most consistently align with party affiliations and to what extent individual votes on these issues predict overall affiliation. Additionally, the classification of "Moderate/Undecided" or needing further clarification indicates scenarios where the decision tree's current depth is insufficient for a clear classification based solely on the selected features.

Here is a Python function representing the decision tree for predicting party affiliation based on voting records. The tree has a maximum depth of 2 and uses the features 'el salvador aid' and 'mx missile' as the root and second-level nodes, respectively.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) based on voting records.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing voting record features.
    
    Returns:
    prediction (int): 0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican.
    nodes (list): List of boolean values representing the conditions at each inner node.
    """
    
    # Initialize list to store node conditions
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Root node condition: Vote on aid to El Salvador
    nodes[0] = X["el salvador aid"] == 2  # Yes vote
    
    # Second-level node condition (if first condition is true): Vote on MX missile
    nodes[1] = X["mx missile"] == 2  # Yes vote
    
    # Make prediction based on node conditions
    if nodes[0]:  # Yes vote on El Salvador aid
        if nodes[1]:  # Yes vote on MX missile
            prediction = 1  # Likely Republican
        else:  # No vote on MX missile
            prediction = 1  # Still likely Republican given yes on El Salvador aid
    else:  # No vote on El Salvador aid or other conditions not met
        if X["anti satellite test ban"] == 2:  # Yes vote on anti-satellite test ban
            prediction = 0  # Likely Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Otherwise, likely Republican
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]

# Example usage
voting_record = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 2,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 2,
    "el salvador aid": 2,  # Yes vote on El Salvador aid
    "religious groups in schools": 2,
    "anti satellite test ban": 1,  # No vote on anti-satellite test ban
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 2,
    "mx missile": 2,  # Yes vote on MX missile
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 2,
    "education spending": 2,
    "superfund right to sue": 2,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 2,
    "export administration act south africa": 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(voting_record)
print(f"Predicted party affiliation: {prediction}")  # 0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican
print(f"Node conditions: {nodes}")
```

In this code:

*   We define a `predict` function that takes a dictionary `X` containing the voting record features.
*   The function initializes a list `nodes` to store the boolean values representing the conditions at each inner node.
*   It evaluates the root node condition based on the 'el salvador aid' feature and stores the result in `nodes[0]`.
*   If the first condition is true, it evaluates the second-level node condition based on the 'mx missile' feature and stores the result in `nodes[1]`.
*   The function makes a prediction based on the node conditions and returns the predicted party affiliation along with the list of node conditions.
*   In the example usage section, we create a sample voting record dictionary and call the `predict` function to demonstrate its usage.
