To induce a decision tree classifier based on the given features for classifying party affiliation (Democrat or Republican), we need to determine which features are most important and how they contribute to the classification. Since I don't have specific data related to each feature's outcome (yes/no) and its corresponding party affiliation, I will create a hypothetical decision tree based on common political stances associated with Democrats and Republicans.

### Hypothetical Decision Tree

Given the complexity of political issues and without direct data, this decision tree simplifies the classification process by focusing on key issues that are often polarized between Democrats and Republicans. For example:

1. **Vote on aid to El Salvador (yes / no)**: This issue might historically align more with Republican foreign policy stances.
2. **Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (yes / no)**: Often, this could be seen as aligning more closely with Republican social values.
3. **Vote on education spending (yes / no)**: Democrats typically support increased spending on education.

### Decision Tree Structure

```
|--- Vote on aid to El Salvador (yes / no)
    |--- yes
        |--- Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (yes / no)
            |--- yes
                |--- class: Republican
            |--- no
                |--- Vote on education spending (yes / no)
                    |--- yes
                        |--- class: Democrat
                    |--- no
                        |--- class: Republican
    |--- no
        |--- Vote on education spending (yes / no)
            |--- yes
                |--- class: Democrat
            |--- no
                |--- Vote on crime (yes / no)
                    |--- yes
                        |--- class: Republican
                    |--- no
                        |--- class: Democrat
```

### Explanation

- **Root Node**: The decision tree starts with the vote on aid to El Salvador. A "yes" might lean towards a more conservative or Republican stance, given historical contexts.
- **First Branch (Yes on El Salvador Aid)**:
  - If also "yes" on allowing religious groups in schools, it likely classifies as Republican due to alignment with traditionally conservative values.
  - If "no" on religious groups in schools, the decision then hinges on education spending. A "yes" here could indicate a Democrat, given their typical support for increased education funding. A "no" might still suggest a Republican leaning.
- **Second Branch (No on El Salvador Aid)**:
  - The next consideration is the vote on education spending. A "yes" here suggests a Democrat, aligning with their usual stance on education.
  - A "no" on education spending leads to considering the vote on crime. A "yes" might indicate tougher-on-crime policies often associated with Republicans, while a "no" could suggest more liberal or Democratic approaches to criminal justice.

### Note

This decision tree is highly simplified and based on hypothetical alignments of political issues with party affiliations. Real-world classifications would require actual data on voting records and their correlations with party affiliation. The importance of each feature (vote) can vary greatly depending on the context, time period, and specific politicians involved.

Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree based on the given features and target variable.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the party affiliation of a politician based on their voting history.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the voting history of a politician.
              The keys are the issue names, and the values are the votes (2 = yes / 1 = no).
              
    Returns:
    prediction (int): The predicted party affiliation (1 = republican / 0 = democrat).
    nodes (list): A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
                  The entries are 1 if the condition is satisfied, and 0 otherwise.
    """
    
    # Initialize the nodes with None
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Vote on el salvador aid
    nodes[0] = X["el salvador aid"] == 2
    
    # Node 1: Vote on allowing religious groups in schools
    nodes[1] = X["religious groups in schools"] == 2
    
    # Node 2: Vote on education spending
    nodes[2] = X["education spending"] == 2
    
    # Node 3: Vote on crime
    nodes[3] = X["crime"] == 2
    
    # Node 4: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution
    nodes[4] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2
    
    # Start predicting based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:  # Yes on el salvador aid
        if nodes[1]:  # Yes on religious groups in schools
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # Yes on education spending
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # No on el salvador aid
        if nodes[3]:  # Yes on crime
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[4]:  # Yes on adoption of the budget resolution
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
                
    # Convert boolean values to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
voting_history = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 2,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 1,
    "el salvador aid": 2,
    "religious groups in schools": 2,
    "anti satellite test ban": 1,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 2,
    "mx missile": 2,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 1,
    "education spending": 1,
    "superfund right to sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 1,
    "export administration act south africa": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(voting_history)
print("Predicted party affiliation:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)

```

This decision tree uses the following logic:

- If a politician voted yes on el salvador aid and yes on allowing religious groups in schools, they are likely republican.
- If a politician voted no on el salvador aid but yes on crime, they are likely republican.
- If a politician voted no on el salvador aid, no on crime, but yes on adoption of the budget resolution, they are likely republican.
- Otherwise, they are likely democrat.

Please note that this is a simplified example and real-world party affiliation prediction would require more complex decision trees or machine learning models.
