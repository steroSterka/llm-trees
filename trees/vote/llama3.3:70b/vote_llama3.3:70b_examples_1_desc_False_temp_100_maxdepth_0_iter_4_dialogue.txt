Based on the provided features, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict party affiliation (Democrat or Republican). Here's the decision tree:

|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no)
||--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras: yes
|||--- class: Republican
||--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras: no
|||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes / no)
||||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban: yes
|||||--- class: Democrat
||||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban: no
|||||--- Vote on MX missile (yes / no)
||||||--- Vote on MX missile: yes
|||||||--- class: Republican
||||||--- Vote on MX missile: no
|||||||--- class: Democrat

Note that this decision tree is not exhaustive, and there might be other possible trees with similar or better performance. The choice of features and splits is based on a simple heuristic:

1. I started by selecting the feature "Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras" as the root node, as it seems to be a polarizing issue that could separate Republicans from Democrats.
2. For the "yes" branch, I assigned the class label "Republican", assuming that support for aid to Nicaraguan contras is more likely among Republicans.
3. For the "no" branch, I selected the feature "Vote on anti-satellite test ban" as the next split, as it could further separate Democrats from Republicans.
4. The subsequent splits were chosen based on similar reasoning, trying to find features that could separate the classes.

Keep in mind that this is a simplified example and real-world decision trees would typically involve more features, more complex interactions, and might require additional techniques such as pruning or regularization to avoid overfitting.

To further improve the tree, you could consider:

* Using more advanced feature selection methods, such as recursive feature elimination or permutation importance.
* Incorporating domain knowledge to inform the choice of features and splits.
* Using ensemble methods, such as random forests or gradient boosting, which can combine multiple decision trees to improve performance and robustness.

If you provide more information about the data, such as the class distribution or any specific requirements, I can try to refine the decision tree accordingly.

Here's a Python function that represents the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts party affiliation based on votes.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing votes on different issues.
             Keys: 'handicapped infants', 'water project cost sharing',
                   'adoption of the budget resolution', 'physician fee freeze',
                   'el salvador aid', 'religious groups in schools',
                   'anti satellite test ban', 'aid to nicaraguan contras',
                   'mx missile', 'immigration', 'synfuels corporation cutback',
                   'education spending', 'superfund right to sue', 'crime',
                   'duty free exports', 'export administration act south africa'

    Returns:
    tuple: (prediction, nodes)
           prediction (int): Predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat)
           nodes (list): List of truth values for inner nodes
    """
    nodes = [None] * 3

    # Node 1: Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras
    nodes[0] = X['aid to nicaraguan contras'] == 2

    # Node 2: Vote on anti-satellite test ban (only if Node 1 is False)
    nodes[1] = X['anti satellite test ban'] == 2 if not nodes[0] else None

    # Node 3: Vote on MX missile (only if Node 2 is False and Node 1 is False)
    nodes[2] = X['mx missile'] == 2 if not nodes[0] and (nodes[1] is None or not nodes[1]) else None

    prediction = 0  # Default to Democrat
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # If aid to Nicaraguan contras, likely Republican
    elif nodes[1] is not None and not nodes[1]:  # If anti-satellite test ban vote is no (i.e., 1)
        if nodes[2] == 2:  # And MX missile vote is yes (i.e., 2), likely Republican
            prediction = 1

    # Replace None values with 0 (False) in the nodes list
    nodes = [int(node) if node is not None else 0 for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 1,
    'el salvador aid': 2,
    'religious groups in schools': 1,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2,
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 2,
    'superfund right to sue': 1,
    'crime': 1,
    'duty free exports': 2,
    'export administration act south africa': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Predicted party affiliation: {prediction} (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican)")
print(f"Inner node truth values: {nodes}")
```

This code represents the decision tree with three inner nodes:

1. Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras
2. Vote on anti-satellite test ban (only if Node 1 is False)
3. Vote on MX missile (only if Node 2 is False and Node 1 is False)

The prediction is based on the values of these nodes, with a default assumption of Democrat (0) unless the conditions for Republican (1) are met.

Note that I've replaced `None` values in the `nodes` list with 0 (False), as per your request to return a list of truth values.
