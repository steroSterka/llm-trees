To induce a decision tree classifier based on the given features for classifying party affiliation as either Democrat or Republican, we first need to understand that the provided features are votes on various issues. These votes can be seen as binary features (yes/no) which can help in distinguishing between Democrats and Republicans based on their voting patterns.

Given the nature of the problem and without actual data, I'll create a hypothetical decision tree based on the assumption that certain issues are more divisive along party lines than others. This approach will involve selecting a subset of the most informative features (votes on specific issues) to construct the decision tree.

### Step 1: Feature Selection
For simplicity and due to the lack of actual voting data, let's assume the following votes are highly divisive and thus most informative for distinguishing between Democrat and Republican affiliations:
- Vote on aid to El Salvador (yes / no)
- Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes / no)
- Vote on MX missile (yes / no)
- Vote on education spending (yes / no)

These issues can be considered as more contentious along party lines, with Republicans potentially being more in favor of military-related expenditures (like aid to El Salvador and the MX missile) and Democrats being more supportive of social programs like education spending and possibly against certain military actions or tests.

### Step 2: Decision Tree Construction
The decision tree will use these selected features to classify party affiliation. Here's a simplified example:

1. **Vote on MX Missile (yes / no)**:
   - If **yes**, this could lean towards Republican, as Republicans might be more likely to support military expenditures.
   - If **no**, proceed to the next feature.

2. **Vote on Education Spending (yes / no)**:
   - If **yes**, this could indicate a Democrat, as Democrats often support increased spending on social programs like education.
   - If **no**, proceed to the next feature.

3. **Vote on Aid to El Salvador (yes / no)**:
   - If **yes**, this might suggest a Republican affiliation due to potential support for military or interventionist policies abroad.
   - If **no**, consider the individual as potentially Democrat, given historical party positions on such issues.

4. **Vote on Anti-Satellite Test Ban (yes / no)**:
   - If **yes**, this could indicate a Democrat, as Democrats are often more supportive of arms control and international cooperation.
   - If **no**, suggest Republican, as they might be less inclined to support restrictions on military capabilities.

### Decision Tree:
```
|--- Vote on MX Missile (yes / no)
||--- yes: class: Republican
||--- no
|||--- Vote on Education Spending (yes / no)
||||--- yes: class: Democrat
||||--- no
|||||--- Vote on Aid to El Salvador (yes / no)
||||||--- yes: class: Republican
||||||--- no
|||||||--- Vote on Anti-Satellite Test Ban (yes / no)
||||||||--- yes: class: Democrat
||||||||--- no: class: Republican
```

This decision tree is highly simplified and based on hypothetical voting patterns. Actual party affiliations can depend on a multitude of factors, including individual beliefs, regional influences, and the specific context of each vote. Without real data, this example illustrates how one might approach building such a classifier using divisive issues as features. In practice, more sophisticated methods, including cross-validation and feature selection techniques, would be employed to ensure the model's accuracy and generalizability.

Here's the Python function for the decision tree based on the provided features and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) based on voting history.

    Args:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing voting history with feature names as keys and votes as values.
             Features are encoded as follows:
             - handicapped infants: Vote on the issue of handicapped infants (2 = yes / 1 = no)
             - water project cost sharing: Vote on water project cost sharing (2 = yes / 1 = no)
             - adoption of the budget resolution: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (2 = yes / 1 = no)
             - physician fee freeze: Vote on physician fee freeze (2 = yes / 1 = no)
             - el salvador aid: Vote on aid to El Salvador (2 = yes / 1 = no)
             - religious groups in schools: Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (2 = yes / 1 = no)
             - anti satellite test ban: Vote on anti-satellite test ban (2 = yes / 1 = no)
             - aid to nicaraguan contras: Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (2 = yes / 1 = no)
             - mx missile: Vote on MX missile (2 = yes / 1 = no)
             - immigration: Vote on immigration (2 = yes / 1 = no)
             - synfuels corporation cutback: Vote on synfuels corporation cutback (2 = yes / 1 = no)
             - education spending: Vote on education spending (2 = yes / 1 = no)
             - superfund right to sue: Vote on superfund right to sue (2 = yes / 1 = no)
             - crime: Vote on crime (2 = yes / 1 = no)
             - duty free exports: Vote on duty free exports (2 = yes / 1 = no)
             - export administration act south africa: Vote on Export Administration Act - South Africa (2 = yes / 1 = no)

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the predicted party affiliation (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican) and a list of truth values for inner nodes.

This code defines a decision tree based on the provided features and target variable. It uses a simple logic to predict the party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) based on voting history. The `predict` function takes a dictionary containing voting history as input and returns a tuple with the predicted party affiliation and a list of truth values for inner nodes.

Note that this is a highly simplified example, and actual decision trees may involve more complex logic and additional features.
