To induce a decision tree classifier with the given features and a maximum depth of 2, we need to determine which features are most important for distinguishing between Democrats and Republicans based on their voting patterns. Since the actual voting data isn't provided, I'll simulate a process based on common practices in decision tree induction.

### Step 1: Feature Selection
We select the top features that are likely to distinguish between Democrat and Republican based on general knowledge of political issues. For simplicity, let's consider "Vote on aid to El Salvador" and "Vote on anti-satellite test ban" as these could be divisive along party lines due to their nature (foreign policy and defense spending).

### Step 2: Decision Tree Construction
With a maximum depth of 2, our tree will have one root node and up to four leaf nodes.

- **Root Node:** "Vote on aid to El Salvador"
    - This choice is based on the assumption that foreign policy issues can be highly partisan.
- **First Level Children:**
    - If yes, proceed to "Vote on anti-satellite test ban".
    - If no, also proceed to "Vote on anti-satellite test ban".

### Step 3: Decision Making at Leaf Nodes
Based on these features, we make the following decisions:

- **Leaf Node 1 (Yes on El Salvador & Yes on Anti-Satellite Test Ban):** Republican
    - The assumption here is that voting yes on both indicates a stance more likely aligned with traditional Republican foreign policy and defense spending positions.
- **Leaf Node 2 (Yes on El Salvador & No on Anti-Satellite Test Ban):** Democrat
    - Voting yes on aid but no on the test ban might suggest a more nuanced, possibly Democratic approach to foreign policy and defense.
- **Leaf Node 3 (No on El Salvador & Yes on Anti-Satellite Test Ban):** Republican
    - This combination could indicate opposition to certain types of foreign aid (which might align with some Republican views) but support for defense initiatives.
- **Leaf Node 4 (No on El Salvador & No on Anti-Satellite Test Ban):** Democrat
    - Opposing both could suggest a more isolationist or pacifist stance, potentially aligning more closely with Democratic positions that prioritize diplomacy and oppose military interventions.

### Decision Tree:

|--- Vote on aid to El Salvador (yes / no)
||--- yes
|||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes / no)
||||--- yes: class: Republican
||||--- no: class: Democrat
||--- no
|||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes / no)
||||--- yes: class: Republican
||||--- no: class: Democrat

This decision tree is highly speculative and based on simplified assumptions about party affiliations and voting patterns. Real-world application would require actual data analysis, potentially involving techniques like information gain or Gini impurity to select features and construct the tree accurately.

Here's how you can implement the decision tree as a Python function based on your problem description. This function takes in a dictionary `X` representing the features of a sample and returns a tuple containing the predicted party affiliation (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes with None values
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Root node condition: Vote on el salvador aid
    nodes[0] = X["el salvador aid"] == 2  # Yes vote
    
    # Second level node condition (considering only yes votes for simplicity)
    nodes[1] = X["anti satellite test ban"] == 2  # Yes vote
    
    # Prediction logic based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    
    # Convert boolean values to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0)
    node_values = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, node_values

# Example usage
sample_features = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 2,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 1,
    "physician fee freeze": 2,
    "el salvador aid": 2,
    "religious groups in schools": 1,
    "anti satellite test ban": 2,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 2,
    "mx missile": 2,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 2,
    "education spending": 1,
    "superfund right to sue": 2,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 1,
    "export administration act south africa": 2
}

prediction, node_values = predict(sample_features)
print(f"Predicted party affiliation: {prediction}")
print(f"Node values: {node_values}")
```

This code snippet implements a decision tree with two levels. The root node checks the vote on El Salvador aid, and the second level checks the vote on the anti-satellite test ban for yes votes on El Salvador aid. Based on these conditions, it predicts whether the party affiliation is Republican (1) or Democrat (0). The function returns both the predicted class and a list of truth values representing the inner nodes' conditions.
