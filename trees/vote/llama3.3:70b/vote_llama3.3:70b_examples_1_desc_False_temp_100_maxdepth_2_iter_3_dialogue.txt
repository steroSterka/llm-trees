To induce a decision tree classifier with the given features and a maximum depth of 2 for classifying party affiliation (Democrat or Republican), we'll first need to understand that the dataset provided seems to be related to votes on various issues, which are typically binary (yes/no). However, without explicit labels (Democrat/Republican) associated with each feature set, we can't directly apply a decision tree algorithm. 

But, let's simulate how one might approach this by selecting the most important features and building a hypothetical decision tree based on common patterns seen in political voting behaviors.

1. **Feature Selection**: Given the lack of explicit labels, we'll hypothesize that certain votes are more divisive along party lines than others. For example:
   - Votes on issues like "aid to El Salvador", "aid to Nicaraguan contras", and "MX missile" might be more indicative of Republican leanings if voted 'yes', due to historical context.
   - Votes on issues like "physician fee freeze", "education spending", and "synfuels corporation cutback" could be more indicative of Democratic leanings if voted 'yes', given typical party stances.

2. **Decision Tree Construction**:
   Given the maximum depth constraint, we'll select two features that are likely to be most divisive along party lines for our decision tree.
   
   Let's choose "Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no)" and "Vote on education spending (yes / no)" as our primary and secondary splits due to their potential for partisanship.

**Decision Tree:**

|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no) == 'yes'
||--- class: Republican
|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no) == 'no'
||--- Vote on education spending (yes / no) == 'yes'
|||--- class: Democrat
||--- Vote on education spending (yes / no) == 'no'
|||--- class: Republican

**Explanation**:
- A 'yes' vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is hypothesized to lean more towards Republican, given historical contexts of military and foreign policy interventions often being supported by Republicans.
- For those who voted 'no' on this issue, a 'yes' vote on education spending might indicate a Democrat due to the party's general support for increased spending in social areas like education.

**Note**: This decision tree is highly hypothetical and based on simplified assumptions about political affiliations with voting behaviors. Real-world application would require actual data labeling (Democrat/Republican) associated with these votes to train an accurate model. Additionally, the selection of features here is speculative and intended for illustrative purposes only; real feature importance could vary significantly based on the specific dataset and historical context.

Here's how you can define the decision tree function based on your features and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Decision Tree to Predict Party Affiliation.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing the voting data.
    
    Returns:
    prediction (int): The predicted party affiliation (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican).
    nodes (list): A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """

    # Define the decision tree nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Primary node: 'aid to nicaraguan contras'
    nodes[0] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2
    
    # Secondary node: 'education spending'
    nodes[1] = X["education spending"] == 2

    # Make the prediction based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican (assuming a default or uncertain case)

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]

# Example usage:
voting_data = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 1,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 1,
    "el salvador aid": 2,
    "religious groups in schools": 2,
    "anti satellite test ban": 1,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 2,  # Primary node
    "mx missile": 2,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 1,
    "education spending": 2,  # Secondary node
    "superfund right to sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 1,
    "export administration act south africa": 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(voting_data)
print(f"Predicted Party Affiliation: {['Democrat', 'Republican'][prediction]}")
print(f"Inner Node Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

In this code:

*   We define a function `predict` that takes in a dictionary `X` representing the voting data.
*   The primary node checks if the vote on "aid to nicaraguan contras" is 'yes' (encoded as 2).
*   If the primary condition is true, it predicts Republican. Otherwise, it proceeds to check the secondary node based on the vote on "education spending".
*   We map the boolean values of the nodes to integers using a list comprehension for easier interpretation.
*   Finally, we demonstrate an example usage with some voting data and print out the predicted party affiliation along with the inner node truth values.
