To induce a decision tree classifier for party affiliation based on the given features, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: The data provided seems to be in a form that suggests voting records of politicians on various issues. Each feature represents a vote (yes/no) on a specific issue.

2. **Choosing the Most Important Features**: Without access to actual voting data and outcomes (Democrat or Republican), we can't directly compute importance scores like Gini impurity reduction or information gain for each feature. However, we can hypothesize which votes might be more divisive along party lines based on historical context and common political ideologies.

3. **Building the Decision Tree**:
    - Without explicit class labels (Democrat/Republican) associated with the voting records, we'll simulate a decision tree based on hypothetical assumptions about how these issues might align with party affiliations in the United States during the period when such votes would have been relevant.
    - The actual construction of a decision tree involves recursively partitioning the data based on the feature that best separates the classes at each node. This process continues until all instances at a node belong to the same class or some stopping criterion is met (e.g., maximum depth, minimum number of samples per split).

Given these constraints and for illustrative purposes, let's build a hypothetical decision tree using the most potentially divisive issues:

- **Issue 1: Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras** - This issue was highly politicized during the Cold War era, with Republicans generally supporting aid (to counter communist influence) and Democrats opposing it.
- **Issue 2: Vote on MX missile** - Defense spending and missile programs have traditionally been more supported by Republicans than Democrats.
- **Issue 3: Vote on allowing religious groups in schools** - This issue can be divisive along party lines, with Republicans often supporting greater religious freedom in public spaces and Democrats advocating for stricter separation of church and state.

Decision Tree:
```
|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no)
||--- yes
|||--- Vote on MX missile (yes / no)
||||--- yes
|||||--- class: Republican
||||--- no
|||||--- Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (yes / no)
||||||--- yes
|||||||--- class: Republican
||||||--- no
|||||||--- class: Democrat
||--- no
|||--- Vote on MX missile (yes / no)
||||--- yes
|||||--- class: Republican
||||--- no
|||||--- Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (yes / no)
||||||--- yes
|||||||--- class: Republican
||||||--- no
|||||||--- class: Democrat
```

**Note**: This decision tree is highly speculative and based on broad generalizations about party affiliations with certain issues. In reality, individual voting records can be influenced by a myriad of factors including personal beliefs, constituency interests, and strategic political considerations. Actual construction of an accurate decision tree would require detailed voting data and corresponding party affiliations for analysis.

Here's a Python function that represents the decision tree based on the given features and target variable. The function takes in a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple with the predicted party affiliation (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each inner node.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Inner nodes represent conditions in the decision tree
    nodes = [None] * 4
    
    # Condition 1: Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no)
    nodes[0] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2
    
    # If yes, check condition 2: Vote on MX missile (yes / no)
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["mx missile"] == 2
    else:
        nodes[1] = False  # This node is not relevant for this branch
        
    # If aid to Nicaraguan contras was yes and MX missile was yes, 
    # then check condition 3: Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (yes / no)
    if nodes[0] and nodes[1]:
        nodes[2] = X["religious groups in schools"] == 2
    else:
        nodes[2] = False  # This node is not relevant for this branch
        
    # If aid to Nicaraguan contras was yes but MX missile was no, 
    # then check condition 4: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (yes / no)
    if nodes[0] and not nodes[1]:
        nodes[3] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2
    else:
        nodes[3] = False  # This node is not relevant for this branch
    
    # Convert boolean values to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) if node is not None else None for node in nodes]
    
    # Make prediction based on conditions
    if nodes[0]:  # Aid to Nicaraguan contras was yes
        if nodes[1]:  # MX missile was yes
            if nodes[2]:  # Religious groups in schools was yes
                prediction = 1  # Predict Republican
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Still predict Republican based on other conditions
        else:  # MX missile was no
            if nodes[3]:  # Adoption of the budget resolution was yes
                prediction = 1  # Predict Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Predict Democrat
    else:  # Aid to Nicaraguan contras was no
        prediction = 0  # Predict Democrat
    
    return prediction, [node if node is not None else 0 for node in nodes]

# Example usage:
X = {
    "handicapped infants": 1,
    "water project cost sharing": 2,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 1,
    "el salvador aid": 1,
    "religious groups in schools": 2,
    "anti satellite test ban": 1,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 2,
    "mx missile": 2,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 1,
    "education spending": 1,
    "superfund right to sue": 2,
    "crime": 1,
    "duty free exports": 2,
    "export administration act south africa": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Party affiliation (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Conditions at each inner node
```

This code implements a decision tree based on the provided features and target variable. It uses the conditions specified in the decision tree to make predictions about party affiliation. The example usage demonstrates how to call the `predict` function with a sample input dictionary `X`.
