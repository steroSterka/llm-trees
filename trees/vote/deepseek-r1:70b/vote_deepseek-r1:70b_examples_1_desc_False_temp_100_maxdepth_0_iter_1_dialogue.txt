Alright, so I need to build a decision tree classifier to predict party affiliation—Democrat or Republican—based on the given features. The features are votes on 16 different issues, each with yes/no responses.

First, I should understand how decision trees work. They split data based on features, trying to find the best splits that separate classes effectively. The goal is to create a tree where each leaf node represents a class (Democrat or Republican).

Looking at the example given for Iris classification, it starts by checking petal width, then maybe other features. Similarly, I'll need to determine which vote issues are most predictive of party affiliation.

I might start with the first feature: Vote on handicapped infants. Historically, Democrats have been more supportive of social programs, so a 'yes' here could indicate Democrat. If 'no', it might lean Republican.

Next, if 'yes' on handicapped infants, maybe check another issue like aid to El Salvador. Republicans in the 80s were less supportive, so a 'no' there might confirm Republican. But if 'yes', that's conflicting, so I need another feature—maybe vote on education spending. Democrats favor more spending, so 'yes' would point back to Democrat.

If the initial vote was 'no' on handicapped infants, then check MX missile funding. Republicans generally support defense spending, so 'yes' indicates Republican. If 'no', maybe they're a Democrat.

I should test this logic with sample data to see if it holds up. Maybe not all cases fit perfectly, but it's a starting point based on typical party alignments.

Here is the decision tree for classifying party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) based on the votes:

```plaintext
|--- Vote on handicapped infants (yes / no)
||--- yes
|||--- Vote on aid to El Salvador (yes / no)
|||||--- no: Republican
|||||--- yes: Democrat
||--- no
|||--- Vote on MX missile (yes / no)
|||||--- yes: Republican
|||||--- no: Democrat
```

**Explanation of the Decision Tree:**

1. **Root Node:** The tree starts by examining the vote on "handicapped infants."
   - If the vote is "yes," it proceeds to check the vote on "aid to El Salvador."
     - A "no" vote indicates a Republican affiliation.
     - A "yes" vote indicates a Democrat affiliation.
   - If the vote is "no," it examines the vote on "MX missile."
     - A "yes" vote suggests a Republican affiliation.
     - A "no" vote suggests a Democrat affiliation.

This tree uses two levels of voting issues to classify party affiliations, reflecting typical alignments where Democrats tend to support social and certain foreign aid initiatives, while Republicans often favor defense spending.

Alright, so I need to create a Python function that predicts party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) based on the given features and their corresponding votes. The decision tree provided earlier uses two main features: "handicapped infants" and "mx missile." 

First, I should map each feature to its correct key as specified in the problem. For instance, "Vote on handicapped infants" is mapped to "handicapped infants," and "Vote on MX missile" is mapped to "mx missile."

Next, according to the target variable encoding, Democrat is 0 and Republican is 1. So, I need to ensure that the function returns these values correctly based on the decision tree logic.

The function should take a dictionary `X` containing all the features as inputs. It will evaluate the conditions step by step, starting with "handicapped infants." If the vote is "yes" (encoded as 2), it proceeds to check "aid to El Salvador." However, in the provided decision tree, after "handicapped infants," it checks "mx missile" if the initial condition is not met. So I need to make sure that the function correctly follows this structure.

I also need to create a list of truth values for each inner node. Each condition check corresponds to an index in this list, where 1 means the condition was satisfied (True), and 0 means it wasn't (False). This helps in tracking which nodes were evaluated during the prediction process.

So, I'll define four nodes:
1. Check if "handicapped infants" vote is yes.
2. If yes, check "aid to El Salvador."
3. If no on "handicapped infants," check "mx missile."

Based on these conditions, the function will return either 0 for Democrat or 1 for Republican.

Finally, I'll test this function with an example input to ensure it works as expected.
</think>

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree logic:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = []
    
    # Node 0: handicapped infants (yes = 2)
    node_handicapped_infants_yes = X["handicapped infants"] == 2
    nodes.append(1 if node_handicapped_infants_yes else 0)
    
    if node_handicapped_infants_yes:
        # Node 1: el salvador aid (no = 1)
        node_el_salvador_aid_no = X["el salvador aid"] == 1
        nodes.append(1 if node_el_salvador_aid_no else 0)
        
        if node_el_salvador_aid_no:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        # Node 2: mx missile (yes = 2)
        node_mx_missile_yes = X["mx missile"] == 2
        nodes.append(1 if node_mx_missile_yes else 0)
        
        if node_mx_missile_yes:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    
    # Pad the nodes list to match expected length (optional, depending on requirements)
    while len(nodes) < 3:  # Adjust based on actual number of inner nodes
        nodes.append(0)
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
example_input = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 1,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 2,
    "el salvador aid": 1,
    "religious groups in schools": 2,
    "anti satellite test ban": 1,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 2,
    "mx missile": 2,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 1,
    "education spending": 2,
    "superfund right to sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 2,
    "export administration act south africa": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_input)
print(f"Prediction: {['Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'][0]}")
print(f"Nodes evaluation: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
- **Function Definition**: The `predict` function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values.
- **Node Evaluation**:
  - First, it checks the vote on "handicapped infants." If the vote is "yes" (encoded as 2), it evaluates the next condition regarding "el salvador aid."
  - If the initial vote is "no," it then evaluates the vote on "mx missile."
- **Prediction Logic**:
  - Based on the conditions, the function predicts whether the affiliation is Republican (1) or Democrat (0).
- **Node Tracking**: A list `nodes` keeps track of each condition's truth value.
- **Example Usage**: An example input dictionary is provided to demonstrate how the function works.

This implementation ensures that the decision tree logic is followed accurately, and the prediction along with node evaluations is returned as specified.
