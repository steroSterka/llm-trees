Based on the features you provided, I'll build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 to classify party affiliation as Democrat or Republican. Since there are many features, I will use a subset of the most important ones.

After selecting the top features using mutual information, here's the induced decision tree:

|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no)
||--- class: Republican
|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (no) 
||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes / no)
|||--- class: Democrat
||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban (no) 
|||--- class: Republican

Here's a brief explanation of the tree:

* The top feature is "Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras", which has a strong correlation with party affiliation. Republicans tend to support aid to the contras, while Democrats tend to oppose it.
* If a congressperson voted against aid to the contras, the next feature is "Vote on anti-satellite test ban". This feature helps distinguish between Democrats and Republicans who might have opposed aid to the contras for different reasons. In this case, voting in favor of the anti-satellite test ban suggests a more dovish stance, which is associated with Democrats.

Note that this decision tree has only 3 nodes (including the root) due to the maximum depth constraint. With more features or a larger depth, the tree could be more complex and potentially capture more nuances in the relationships between votes and party affiliation.

Here's the Python function implementing the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) based on voting records.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing voting records for a congressperson.
              Each key is a vote issue, and each value is an integer representing
              the congressperson's vote (2 = yes / 1 = no).
    
    Returns:
    prediction: Predicted party affiliation (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican)
    nodes: List of boolean values representing the truth values of inner nodes.
           The first element corresponds to the condition 'aid to nicaraguan contras' == 2,
           and the second element corresponds to the condition 'anti satellite test ban' == 2.
    """
    
    # Initialize list to store node truth values
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Check if congressperson voted for aid to Nicaraguan contras
    nodes[0] = X['aid to nicaraguan contras'] == 2
    
    # If they did, predict Republican (1)
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        # Otherwise, check their vote on anti-satellite test ban
        nodes[1] = X['anti satellite test ban'] == 2
        
        # If they voted for the ban, predict Democrat (0); otherwise, predict Republican (1)
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where each key is a vote issue and each value is an integer representing the congressperson's vote. It then uses these voting records to predict the congressperson's party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) based on the decision tree logic.

The function returns two values: `prediction`, which represents the predicted party affiliation (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican), and `nodes`, a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.
