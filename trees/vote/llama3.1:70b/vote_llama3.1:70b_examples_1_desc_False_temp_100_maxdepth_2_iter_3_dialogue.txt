Based on the provided features, I will induce a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 to classify party affiliation as Democrat or Republican.

After analyzing the features, I have selected the top 2 most important features based on their potential to distinguish between Democrats and Republicans. These features are:

1. Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no)
2. Vote on MX missile (yes / no)

Here is the induced decision tree:

|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no) == yes
||--- class: Republican
|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no) == no
||--- Vote on MX missile (yes / no) == yes
|||--- class: Republican
||--- Vote on MX missile (yes / no) == no
|||--- class: Democrat

This decision tree suggests that:

* If a senator voted in favor of aid to Nicaraguan contras, they are likely to be a Republican.
* If a senator did not vote in favor of aid to Nicaraguan contras, their stance on the MX missile issue is used to determine their party affiliation. Those who voted in favor of the MX missile are more likely to be Republicans, while those who did not are more likely to be Democrats.

Please note that this decision tree is a simplified representation and actual classification performance may vary based on the specific dataset and other factors.

Based on the provided features and target variable, I will define a Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 1  # no aid to Nicaraguan contras
    nodes[1] = X["mx missile"] == 1  # no MX missile
    
    if not nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # republican
    else:
        if not nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values. The function returns a tuple containing the predicted party affiliation (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

Note that I've used the encoded values for the target variable (`target`) as specified in the problem description: 1 = republican, 0 = democrat. Also, I've assumed that the feature values are integers, where 2 indicates "yes" or presence of a condition, and 1 indicates "no" or absence of a condition.

You can call this function with a dictionary containing the feature values, like this:

```python
X = {
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 1,
    "mx missile": 2,
    # other features...
}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(prediction)  # predicted party affiliation
print(nodes)  # truth values of inner nodes
```
