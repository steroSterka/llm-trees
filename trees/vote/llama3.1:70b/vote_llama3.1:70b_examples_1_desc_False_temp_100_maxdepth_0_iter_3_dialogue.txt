Based on the features you provided, I will build a decision tree classifier using the most important features to classify party affiliation as Democrat or Republican. Here is the resulting decision tree:


|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no)
||--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras: yes
|||--- class: Republican
||--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras: no
|||--- Vote on MX missile (yes / no)
||||--- Vote on MX missile: yes
|||||--- class: Republican
||||--- Vote on MX missile: no
|||||--- Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (yes / no)
||||||--- Vote on adoption of the budget resolution: yes
|||||||--- class: Democrat
||||||--- Vote on adoption of the budget resolution: no
|||||||--- class: Republican


The decision tree uses three features to classify party affiliation:

1. Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no)
2. Vote on MX missile (yes / no)
3. Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (yes / no)

These features are used in a hierarchical manner to split the data and make predictions about party affiliation.

Here's a brief explanation of each feature:

* Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras: This vote is often associated with foreign policy and military intervention, which tend to be more supported by Republicans.
* Vote on MX missile: This vote relates to defense spending and military strength, which are also typically supported by Republicans.
* Vote on adoption of the budget resolution: This vote concerns fiscal policy and government spending, which can be a divisive issue between Democrats and Republicans.

By using these features in combination, the decision tree is able to accurately classify party affiliation for most instances.
=======
Based on the provided features, I will attempt to build a decision tree classifier for party affiliation. Since there are many features and not all of them might be equally important, I'll select the top 5 most informative features using mutual information.

After selecting the features, here is the induced decision tree:

|--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes / no)
||--- yes
|||--- class: Democrat
||--- no
|||--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no)
||||--- yes
|||||--- class: Republican
||||--- no
|||||--- Vote on crime (yes / no)
||||||--- yes
|||||||--- class: Republican
||||||--- no
|||||||--- Vote on physician fee freeze (yes / no)
||||||||--- yes
|||||||||--- class: Democrat
||||||||--- no
|||||||||--- class: Republican

In this decision tree:

1. The most important feature is the vote on anti-satellite test ban, which separates Democrats from Republicans with a high accuracy.
2. If a senator voted "no" on anti-satellite test ban, we look at their vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras.
3. If they voted "yes" on aid to Nicaraguan contras, it's likely they are Republican.
4. If they voted "no" on aid to Nicaraguan contras, we examine their vote on crime.
5. If they voted "yes" on crime, it's still likely they are Republican.
6. If they voted "no" on crime, we look at their vote on physician fee freeze.
7. If they voted "yes" on physician fee freeze, it's more likely they are Democrat.

Please note that this decision tree is not a definitive model and may require further refinement with additional data or feature engineering.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2
    nodes[1] = X["mx missile"] == 2
    nodes[2] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```
This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values. The function returns a tuple containing the predicted party affiliation (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Note that I used the exact feature names and encodings as specified in the problem statement. Also, I assumed that the target variable is encoded as 0 for Democrat and 1 for Republican, as stated in the problem statement.
=======
Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier based on the provided features and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: anti satellite test ban (2 = yes / 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["anti satellite test ban"] == 2
    
    # Node 1: aid to nicaraguan contras (2 = yes / 1 = no)
    nodes[1] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2
    
    # Node 2: crime (2 = yes / 1 = no)
    nodes[2] = X["crime"] == 2
    
    # Node 3: mx missile (2 = yes / 1 = no)
    nodes[3] = X["mx missile"] == 2
    
    # Node 4: religious groups in schools (2 = yes / 1 = no)
    nodes[4] = X["religious groups in schools"] == 2
    
    # Node 5: synfuels corporation cutback (2 = yes / 1 = no)
    nodes[5] = X["synfuels corporation cutback"] == 2

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1
                elif nodes[4] or nodes[5]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

Please note that I've made some assumptions about the feature names and their values based on the provided information. If there are any discrepancies, please let me know and I'll make the necessary adjustments.

Also, this implementation assumes that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required features as keys with their corresponding values.
