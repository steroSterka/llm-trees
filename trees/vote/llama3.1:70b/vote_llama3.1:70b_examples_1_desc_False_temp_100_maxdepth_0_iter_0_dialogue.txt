To build a decision tree classifier for party affiliation based on the provided features, we need to first determine which features are most important in distinguishing between Democrats and Republicans. Since you haven't provided actual data or specific outcomes for each feature, I'll simulate an analysis that typically precedes building a decision tree.

Assuming we have a dataset where each row represents a politician's voting record across the issues listed, and their party affiliation (Democrat or Republican), here's how we might proceed:

### Feature Importance

In real-world scenarios, you would use techniques such as mutual information, recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV), or permutation importance from random forests to determine feature importance. However, given the nature of this exercise, let's hypothesize based on political context.

Features that are likely to be highly indicative of party affiliation include:

- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras
- Vote on MX missile
- Vote on crime
- Vote on Export Administration Act - South Africa

These issues tend to be more polarizing and historically align with partisan divides in the U.S., particularly during certain periods.

### Simulated Decision Tree

Given the hypothetical importance of these features, a simplified decision tree might look like this:

|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras = yes
||--- Vote on MX missile = yes
||||--- class: Republican
||--- Vote on MX missile = no
||||--- Vote on crime = yes
|||||--- class: Democrat
||||--- Vote on crime = no
|||||--- class: Democrat

|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras = no
||--- Vote on Export Administration Act - South Africa = yes
||||--- class: Democrat
||--- Vote on Export Administration Act - South Africa = no
||||--- class: Republican

### Explanation

- **Aid to Nicaraguan Contras**: Historically, Republicans were more likely to support aid.
- **MX Missile**: Typically supported by Republicans due to its implications for defense spending and military strength.
- **Crime**: Democrats often take a different stance on crime legislation compared to Republicans, with a focus on rehabilitation over punishment in some cases.
- **Export Administration Act - South Africa**: This issue might have been more contentious and could serve as a proxy for broader stances on international relations and human rights.

### Note

This decision tree is highly speculative and based on broad political trends rather than actual data analysis. In practice, building an accurate decision tree requires analyzing real voting records and their correlations with party affiliations using machine learning algorithms.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting party affiliation based on voting records:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras
    nodes[0] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2
    
    # Node 1: Vote on MX missile
    nodes[1] = X["mx missile"] == 2
    
    # Node 2: Vote on crime
    nodes[2] = X["crime"] == 2
    
    # Node 3: Vote on Export Administration Act - South Africa
    nodes[3] = X["export administration act south africa"] == 2

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

In this function, `X` is a dictionary containing the voting record of an individual, where each key corresponds to a feature (e.g., "aid to nicaraguan contras", "mx missile", etc.) and each value is the corresponding vote (2 for yes, 1 for no).

The function uses these votes to traverse the decision tree and make a prediction about the individual's party affiliation (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican). The `nodes` list keeps track of the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input dictionary `X` contains all the necessary features with their corresponding votes. If any feature is missing or has an invalid vote value, the function may raise a KeyError or produce incorrect results.
