Based on the provided features, I will induce a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 to classify party affiliation as Democrat or Republican.

After analyzing the features, I selected the most important ones based on their potential impact on party affiliation. Here is the induced decision tree:

|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no)
||--- yes
|||--- class: Republican
||--- no
|||--- Vote on Export Administration Act - South Africa (yes / no)
||||--- yes
|||||--- class: Democrat
||||--- no
|||||--- class: Republican

The decision tree uses the following features:

1. Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no): This feature is a strong indicator of party affiliation, as Republicans were more likely to support aid to the contras during the 1980s.
2. Vote on Export Administration Act - South Africa (yes / no): This feature is used as a secondary splitter, as Democrats were more likely to support sanctions against South Africa's apartheid regime.

The tree classifies party affiliation as follows:

* If a senator voted in favor of aid to Nicaraguan contras, they are classified as Republican.
* If a senator did not vote in favor of aid to Nicaraguan contras and voted in favor of the Export Administration Act - South Africa, they are classified as Democrat.
* Otherwise, they are classified as Republican.

Please note that this decision tree is based on a simplified analysis and might not reflect the actual complexities of party affiliation.

Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2  # yes for aid to Nicaraguan contras
    nodes[1] = X["export administration act south africa"] == 2  # yes for Export Administration Act - South Africa

    if not nodes[0]:  # no for aid to Nicaraguan contras
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # republican
    else:  # yes for aid to Nicaraguan contras
        prediction = 1  # republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input where each key corresponds to a feature and its value is the corresponding value of that feature. The function returns two values:

*   `prediction`: A binary classification result (0 for democrat, 1 for republican)
*   `nodes`: A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the decision tree's internal nodes.

You can use this function by passing in a dictionary with the required features as keys and their corresponding values. For example:

```python
X = {
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 2,
    "export administration act south africa": 1,
}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 1 (republican)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: Nodes: [True, False]
```
