Based on the provided features, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict whether the outcome of labor negotiations is good or bad. Since you didn't provide a specific dataset, I'll make some assumptions about the relationships between the features and the target variable.

Here's the induced decision tree with a maximum depth of 2:

|--- wage increase in first year of contract <= 4
||--- employer contributions to pension plan == "retirement allowance included"
|||--- class: good
||--- employer contributions to pension plan != "retirement allowance included"
|||--- class: bad
|--- wage increase in first year of contract > 4
||--- standby pay <= 10
|||--- class: good
||--- standby pay > 10
|||--- class: bad

The decision tree uses the following features:

1. Wage increase in first year of contract (<= 4 or > 4)
2. Employer contributions to pension plan (retirement allowance included or not) - only considered when wage increase is <= 4
3. Standby pay (<= 10 or > 10) - only considered when wage increase is > 4

The tree suggests that:

* A higher wage increase in the first year (> 4) leads to a better outcome.
* When the wage increase is moderate (<= 4), employer contributions to the pension plan play a crucial role. If the employer offers a retirement allowance, the outcome is more likely to be good.
* When the wage increase is high (> 4), a lower standby pay (<= 10) leads to a better outcome.

Please note that this decision tree is induced based on general assumptions and may not accurately represent real-world relationships between the features and target variable. A more accurate model would require access to actual data and careful analysis of the relationships between variables.

Here is the Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes based on the decision tree I induced earlier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Wage increase in first year of contract <= 4.5
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.5
    
    # Node 1: Standby pay <= 10 (only considered when wage increase is > 4.5)
    if not nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["standby pay"] <= 10
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["pension"] == "ret_allw"
    
    # Prediction based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = int(nodes[1])  # Convert boolean to integer (1 for True, 0 for False)
    else:
        prediction = int(not nodes[1])  # Invert the boolean value
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where each key corresponds to a feature in the dataset. The function then calculates the values of the two inner nodes based on the decision tree and returns a tuple containing the predicted outcome (`prediction`) and the truth values of the inner nodes (`nodes`).
