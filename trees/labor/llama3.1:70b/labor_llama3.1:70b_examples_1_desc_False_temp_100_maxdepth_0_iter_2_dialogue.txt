To induce a decision tree classifier based on the provided features for classifying the outcome of labor negotiations as good or bad, we first need to understand that the quality of the decision tree depends heavily on the dataset used to train it. Since I don't have access to specific data points (i.e., labeled outcomes), I'll make an educated guess about how a decision tree might look based on the importance and relevance of each feature to the outcome of labor negotiations.

Given the complexity and diversity of features, a real-world approach would involve analyzing a dataset with labeled outcomes to determine the most significant factors. However, in this hypothetical scenario, let's prioritize features that are likely to have a direct impact on the negotiation outcome:

1. **Financial Benefits**: Wage increases over three years, cost of living adjustment, and employer contributions (pension plan, dental plan, health plan) are critical for employee financial well-being.
2. **Work-Life Balance**: Number of working hours during the week and paid vacation days directly affect work-life balance.
3. **Employer Support**: Employer's help during long-term disability, education allowance, and contribution towards bereavement costs show employer support beyond salary.

Here's a simplified decision tree that could classify labor negotiation outcomes as good or bad based on these features:

```
|--- Wage increase in first year of contract > 4
||--- Employer contributions to pension plan = retirement allowance included or employee contribution
|||--- Number of paid vacation days = generous
||||--- class: Good
|||--- Number of paid vacation days = average or below average
||||--- Employer's help during long-term disability = yes
|||||--- class: Good
|||||--- class: Bad
||--- Employer contributions to pension plan = none
|||--- Wage increase in second year of contract > 4 and Wage increase in third year of contract > 4
||||--- Education allowance = yes
|||||--- class: Good
|||||--- class: Bad
|||--- Wage increase in second year of contract <= 4 or Wage increase in third year of contract <= 4
||||--- Standby pay > 10 and Shift differential > 5
|||||--- class: Good
|||||--- class: Bad
|--- Wage increase in first year of contract <= 4
||--- Cost of living adjustment = total compensation adjustment
|||--- Employer's contribution towards the health plan = full or half
||||--- Number of statutory holidays >= 12
|||||--- class: Good
|||||--- class: Bad
|||--- Employer's contribution towards the health plan = none
||||--- Number of working hours during week <= 37 and Employers contribution towards the dental plan != none
|||||--- class: Good
|||||--- class: Bad
```

This decision tree prioritizes significant wage increases, comprehensive employer contributions (especially towards pension and health plans), generous paid vacation days, support during long-term disability, education allowance, and better work-life balance conditions as indicators of a "good" negotiation outcome. However, without actual data to train on, this remains a hypothetical model that might need adjustments based on real-world data analysis.

Here's a Python function implementing the decision tree for predicting labor negotiation outcomes based on the provided features:

```python

This function takes a dictionary `X` of features and returns the predicted outcome (good or bad) as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The inner node conditions are implemented based on the provided decision tree logic. Note that some thresholds were chosen arbitrarily due to the lack of specific data, but these can be adjusted according to actual data analysis.
