Based on the features you provided, I will induce a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 to classify whether the outcome of the labor negotiations is good or bad.

**Feature Selection:**

To build an effective decision tree, we need to select the most important features that contribute to the classification. After analyzing the features, I have selected the top 5 features based on their potential impact on the negotiation outcome:

1. **Wage increase in first year of contract** (2 to 7)
2. **Cost of living adjustment** (none / temporary cost of living adjustment formula / total compensation adjustment)
3. **Number of paid vacation days** (below average / average / generous)
4. **Employer contributions to pension plan** (none / retirement allowance included / employee contribution)
5. **Standby pay** (2 to 25)

These features seem to have a direct impact on the employees' compensation and benefits, which are likely to influence the negotiation outcome.

**Decision Tree:**

Here is the induced decision tree with a maximum depth of 2:

|--- Wage increase in first year of contract <= 4
||--- Cost of living adjustment = none
|||--- class: bad
||--- Cost of living adjustment != none
|||--- Number of paid vacation days >= average
||||--- class: good
|||--- Number of paid vacation days < average
||||--- class: bad

|--- Wage increase in first year of contract > 4
||--- Employer contributions to pension plan = employee contribution
|||--- Standby pay <= 10
||||--- class: good
|||--- Standby pay > 10
||||--- class: bad
||--- Employer contributions to pension plan != employee contribution
|||--- Number of paid vacation days >= average
||||--- class: good
|||--- Number of paid vacation days < average
||||--- class: bad

This decision tree suggests that a wage increase in the first year of contract above 4, combined with a cost of living adjustment and decent employer contributions to pension plan, leads to a good negotiation outcome. On the other hand, low wage increases, no cost of living adjustment, or inadequate vacation days contribute to a bad negotiation outcome.

Please note that this decision tree is just one possible interpretation based on the provided features and may not capture all nuances of real-world labor negotiations.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 5.0
    nodes[1] = X["cost of living adjustment"] != "none"
    nodes[2] = X["pension"] == "empl_contr"
    nodes[3] = X["standby pay"] > 10

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where each key corresponds to a feature and its value is the corresponding feature value. The function then evaluates the decision tree by traversing the nodes in top-down order.

The target variable encoding used here assumes that `0 = bad` and `1 = good`. If this encoding needs to be changed, simply modify the prediction assignment accordingly.

Here's an example usage:

```python
X = {
    "wage increase first year": 4.5,
    "cost of living adjustment": "tcf",
    "pension": "empl_contr",
    "standby pay": 12,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This code will output the prediction (either `0` or `1`) and the values of the decision tree nodes.
