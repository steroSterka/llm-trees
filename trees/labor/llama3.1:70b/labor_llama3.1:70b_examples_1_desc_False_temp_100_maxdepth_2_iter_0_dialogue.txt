To build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 using the most important features, I'll use a subset of the provided features. Since there are many features and not all may be equally relevant for predicting the outcome of labor negotiations as good or bad, we should prioritize those that likely have the greatest impact on the negotiation outcomes.

Given the complexity and variety of the features, let's consider some logical steps to narrow down to the most impactful ones:

1. **Duration of Agreement**: This might be crucial because a longer agreement duration could indicate more significant concessions from one or both parties.
2. **Wage Increase in First Year of Contract**: Initial wage increases can set the tone for the rest of the agreement and impact overall satisfaction with the deal.
3. **Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA)**: A comprehensive COLA might significantly benefit employees, making it a key bargaining chip.

Given these considerations, let's propose a simplified decision tree focusing on these features:

```
|--- Wage Increase in First Year <= 4
||--- Duration of Agreement <= 5
|||--- Class: Bad (Assuming lower initial wage increase and shorter agreement duration might indicate less favorable terms for employees)
||--- Duration of Agreement > 5
|||--- Class: Good (A longer agreement with at least a moderate initial wage increase could suggest more stable, favorable conditions)
|--- Wage Increase in First Year > 4
||--- COLA == Total Compensation Adjustment
|||--- Class: Good (Higher initial wage increase combined with comprehensive COLA suggests very favorable terms for employees)
||--- COLA != Total Compensation Adjustment
|||--- Class: Bad (Despite a higher initial wage increase, the lack of a comprehensive COLA might indicate less favorable overall conditions)
```

This decision tree uses a maximum depth of 2 and focuses on what are arguably some of the most impactful features. It classifies outcomes as "Good" or "Bad" based on these critical negotiation points:

- **Low initial wage increase** with shorter agreements is considered bad, potentially indicating less favorable terms for employees.
- **Higher initial wage increases**, especially when combined with longer agreement durations and comprehensive COLAs, are seen as good outcomes.

Note that without actual data on the outcomes of labor negotiations (good or bad), this decision tree is speculative. Real-world application would require training a model on labeled datasets to accurately predict negotiation outcomes based on these features.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.5
    nodes[1] = (X["cost of living adjustment"] == "tc")

    if nodes[0]:
        if X["duration"] > 5:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
```

Note that I've used the feature encodings and ranges provided in the description to set the thresholds for the decision tree. Specifically:

* `wage increase first year` is considered "low" if it's less than or equal to 4.5.
* `cost of living adjustment` is considered "good" if it's equal to "tc".
* `duration` is considered "long" if it's greater than 5.

Also, I've used the target variable encoding (0 = bad, 1 = good) to set the prediction values accordingly.
