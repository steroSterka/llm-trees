Based on the provided features, I will attempt to build a decision tree using the most important features. Please note that this is a simplified approach and actual implementation would require more data and possibly more complex models.

Here's my attempt at building a decision tree:

**Decision Tree:**

|--- wage increase in first year of contract <= 4
||--- class: bad (outcome of labor negotiations)
|--- wage increase in first year of contract > 4
||--- number of paid vacation days == generous
|||--- class: good (outcome of labor negotiations)
||--- number of paid vacation days != generous
|||--- employer contributions to pension plan == retirement allowance included
||||--- class: good (outcome of labor negotiations)
||||--- employer contributions to pension plan != retirement allowance included
|||||--- cost of living adjustment == total compensation adjustment
||||||--- class: good (outcome of labor negotiations)
||||||--- cost of living adjustment != total compensation adjustment
|||||||--- standby pay <= 10
||||||||--- class: bad (outcome of labor negotiations)
||||||||--- standby pay > 10
|||||||||--- class: good (outcome of labor negotiations)

The decision tree uses the following features in order:

1. wage increase in first year of contract
2. number of paid vacation days
3. employer contributions to pension plan
4. cost of living adjustment
5. standby pay

These features are chosen because they seem to be related to financial benefits, job security, and work-life balance, which could impact the outcome of labor negotiations.

**Justification:**

* Wage increase in first year of contract is a key feature as it directly affects employees' salaries.
* Number of paid vacation days is an important benefit that impacts work-life balance and employee satisfaction.
* Employer contributions to pension plan show the employer's commitment to employees' long-term financial security.
* Cost of living adjustment is crucial for maintaining employees' purchasing power, especially in times of inflation.
* Standby pay affects employees' overall compensation package.

Keep in mind that this decision tree might not be optimal or exhaustive. It's a starting point based on feature selection and could benefit from more data and refinement.

Here is the Python function based on your decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] > 4.0
    nodes[1] = X["vacation"] == "gnr"
    nodes[2] = X["cost of living adjustment"] != "none"
    nodes[3] = X["standby pay"] > 10
    nodes[4] = X["education allowance"]

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1
                    else:
                        prediction = 0
                else:
                    prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```
This function uses the provided decision tree to make predictions based on the input features. It returns a tuple containing the predicted value (either 0 for "bad" or 1 for "good") and a list of boolean values representing the state of each node in the decision tree.

Note that I made some assumptions about how to handle categorical variables, such as mapping "gnr" to True and "none" to False. You may need to adjust these mappings depending on your specific use case.
