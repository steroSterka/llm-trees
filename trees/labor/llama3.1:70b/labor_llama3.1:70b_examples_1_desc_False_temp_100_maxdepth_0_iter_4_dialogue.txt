I'll build a decision tree using the most important features. Since I don't have access to the actual data, I'll make some assumptions about the relationships between the features and the outcome of the labor negotiations (good or bad). Please note that this is a simplified example, and in practice, you would use a more robust method to select the most important features.

After analyzing the features, I've selected the top 5 most relevant ones:

1. Wage increase in first year of contract (2 to 7)
2. Duration of agreement (1 to 7)
3. Cost of living adjustment (none / temporary cost of living adjustment formula / total compensation adjustment)
4. Number of paid vacation days (below average / average / generous)
5. Employer's contribution towards the health plan (none / half / full)

Here's a possible decision tree:

|--- Wage increase in first year of contract <= 4
||--- Duration of agreement <= 3
|||--- class: bad
||--- Duration of agreement > 3
|||--- Cost of living adjustment = none
||||--- class: bad
||||--- Cost of living adjustment != none
|||||--- class: good
|--- Wage increase in first year of contract > 4
||--- Number of paid vacation days = generous
|||--- Employer's contribution towards the health plan = full
||||--- class: good
||||--- Employer's contribution towards the health plan != full
|||||--- class: bad
||--- Number of paid vacation days != generous
|||--- class: bad

This decision tree can be interpreted as follows:

* If the wage increase in the first year is 4% or less, and the duration of the agreement is 3 years or less, the outcome is likely to be bad.
* If the wage increase in the first year is more than 4%, and the number of paid vacation days is generous (i.e., above average), and the employer's contribution towards the health plan is full, the outcome is likely to be good.

Please note that this is a simplified example and may not reflect the actual relationships between the features and the outcome. In practice, you would use more robust methods, such as cross-validation and feature selection techniques, to build a more accurate decision tree.
=======
To build a decision tree that classifies whether the outcome of labor negotiations is good or bad based on the provided features, we'll have to select the most important features. Since I don't have actual data to perform feature selection techniques like mutual information or recursive feature elimination, I will rely on my understanding of which features are likely to be most influential in labor negotiations.

Based on general knowledge about what typically makes a labor negotiation outcome "good" or "bad," the following features seem particularly relevant:

1. **Wage increase in first year of contract (2 to 7)**: A higher wage increase is generally favorable.
2. **Number of paid vacation days (below average / average / generous)**: More generous vacation policies are typically seen as better.
3. **Cost of living adjustment (none / temporary cost of living adjustment formula / total compensation adjustment)**: Having a mechanism for adjusting wages based on inflation can be beneficial.
4. **Employer contributions to pension plan (none / retirement allowance included / employee contribution)**: Employer contributions to a pension plan are generally viewed positively.

Given these features, here's a simplified decision tree:

- **Wage increase in first year of contract <= 3**
    - **Number of paid vacation days == below average**
        - **Outcome:** Bad
    - **Number of paid vacation days > below average**
        - **Cost of living adjustment == none**
            - **Outcome:** Bad
        - **Cost of living adjustment != none**
            - **Outcome:** Good

- **Wage increase in first year of contract > 3**
    - **Employer contributions to pension plan == none**
        - **Number of paid vacation days <= average**
            - **Outcome:** Bad
        - **Number of paid vacation days > average**
            - **Outcome:** Good
    - **Employer contributions to pension plan != none**
        - **Outcome:** Good

This decision tree is a simplified example based on logical deductions rather than actual data analysis. In practice, you would use machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn in Python) and your dataset to train a decision tree classifier, which might yield different results based on patterns within the data.

Remember, this example does not account for all possible interactions between features or their specific values beyond what's been chosen as representative. Real-world application would require actual labor negotiation outcome data to be accurate.

Here's the function that implements the decision tree:
=======
Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree based on the provided features and target variable:
>>>>>>> main

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    
<<<<<<< HEAD
    # Wage increase in first year of contract <= 4
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4
    
    # Duration of agreement <= 3
    nodes[1] = X["duration"] <= 3
    
    # Cost of living adjustment is none
    nodes[2] = X["cost of living adjustment"] == "none"
    
    # Number of paid vacation days is generous (gnr)
    nodes[3] = X["vacation"] == "gnr"
    
    # Employer's contribution towards the health plan is full
    nodes[4] = X["contribution to health plan"] == "full"
    
    if not nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1 if (nodes[3] and nodes[4]) else 0
        nodes[5] = False
        nodes[6] = False
    elif not nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1 if not nodes[2] else 0
        nodes[5] = True
        nodes[6] = not nodes[2]
    else:
        prediction = 0
        nodes[5] = True
        nodes[6] = True
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes[:7]]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the input features as keys and their corresponding values. The function implements the decision tree using the selected features: "wage increase first year", "duration", "cost of living adjustment", "vacation", and "contribution to health plan".

The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes, which are used to determine the prediction. The prediction is then returned along with the `nodes` list.

Note that I've assumed some threshold values for the features based on the provided description. If you need to adjust these thresholds or modify the decision tree, please let me know!
=======
    # Node 1: Wage increase in first year <= 3.5
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 3.5
    
    # Node 2: Number of paid vacation days == below average (ba)
    nodes[1] = X["vacation"] == "ba"
    
    # Node 3: Cost of living adjustment != none
    nodes[2] = X["cost of living adjustment"] != "none"
    
    # Node 4: Employer contributions to pension plan != none
    nodes[3] = X["pension"] != "none"
    
    # Node 5: Wage increase in first year > 3.5 and number of paid vacation days > below average (ba)
    nodes[4] = not nodes[0] and X["vacation"] != "ba"
    
    # Node 6: Employer contributions to pension plan == none and number of paid vacation days <= average (avg)
    nodes[5] = nodes[3] is False and X["vacation"] in ["ba", "avg"]
    
    # Node 7: Wage increase in first year > 3.5, employer contributions to pension plan != none
    nodes[6] = not nodes[0] and nodes[3]
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[4]:
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[6]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
                
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where each key corresponds to a feature and its value is the feature's value. The function returns a tuple containing the predicted target variable (either 0 or 1) and a list of boolean values representing the decision tree nodes.

Note that I've used a simple threshold of 3.5 for the "wage increase first year" feature, which may not be optimal. You may want to experiment with different thresholds to improve the model's performance.

Also, I've assumed that the "vacation" feature is categorical and can take one of three values: "ba", "avg", or something else (not specified in the problem description). If this is not the case, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
