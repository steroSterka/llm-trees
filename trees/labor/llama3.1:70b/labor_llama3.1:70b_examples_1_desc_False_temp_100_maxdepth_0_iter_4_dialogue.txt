To build a decision tree that classifies whether the outcome of labor negotiations is good or bad based on the provided features, we'll have to select the most important features. Since I don't have actual data to perform feature selection techniques like mutual information or recursive feature elimination, I will rely on my understanding of which features are likely to be most influential in labor negotiations.

Based on general knowledge about what typically makes a labor negotiation outcome "good" or "bad," the following features seem particularly relevant:

1. **Wage increase in first year of contract (2 to 7)**: A higher wage increase is generally favorable.
2. **Number of paid vacation days (below average / average / generous)**: More generous vacation policies are typically seen as better.
3. **Cost of living adjustment (none / temporary cost of living adjustment formula / total compensation adjustment)**: Having a mechanism for adjusting wages based on inflation can be beneficial.
4. **Employer contributions to pension plan (none / retirement allowance included / employee contribution)**: Employer contributions to a pension plan are generally viewed positively.

Given these features, here's a simplified decision tree:

- **Wage increase in first year of contract <= 3**
    - **Number of paid vacation days == below average**
        - **Outcome:** Bad
    - **Number of paid vacation days > below average**
        - **Cost of living adjustment == none**
            - **Outcome:** Bad
        - **Cost of living adjustment != none**
            - **Outcome:** Good

- **Wage increase in first year of contract > 3**
    - **Employer contributions to pension plan == none**
        - **Number of paid vacation days <= average**
            - **Outcome:** Bad
        - **Number of paid vacation days > average**
            - **Outcome:** Good
    - **Employer contributions to pension plan != none**
        - **Outcome:** Good

This decision tree is a simplified example based on logical deductions rather than actual data analysis. In practice, you would use machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn in Python) and your dataset to train a decision tree classifier, which might yield different results based on patterns within the data.

Remember, this example does not account for all possible interactions between features or their specific values beyond what's been chosen as representative. Real-world application would require actual labor negotiation outcome data to be accurate.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree based on the provided features and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Wage increase in first year <= 3.5
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 3.5
    
    # Node 2: Number of paid vacation days == below average (ba)
    nodes[1] = X["vacation"] == "ba"
    
    # Node 3: Cost of living adjustment != none
    nodes[2] = X["cost of living adjustment"] != "none"
    
    # Node 4: Employer contributions to pension plan != none
    nodes[3] = X["pension"] != "none"
    
    # Node 5: Wage increase in first year > 3.5 and number of paid vacation days > below average (ba)
    nodes[4] = not nodes[0] and X["vacation"] != "ba"
    
    # Node 6: Employer contributions to pension plan == none and number of paid vacation days <= average (avg)
    nodes[5] = nodes[3] is False and X["vacation"] in ["ba", "avg"]
    
    # Node 7: Wage increase in first year > 3.5, employer contributions to pension plan != none
    nodes[6] = not nodes[0] and nodes[3]
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[4]:
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[6]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
                
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where each key corresponds to a feature and its value is the feature's value. The function returns a tuple containing the predicted target variable (either 0 or 1) and a list of boolean values representing the decision tree nodes.

Note that I've used a simple threshold of 3.5 for the "wage increase first year" feature, which may not be optimal. You may want to experiment with different thresholds to improve the model's performance.

Also, I've assumed that the "vacation" feature is categorical and can take one of three values: "ba", "avg", or something else (not specified in the problem description). If this is not the case, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
