Based on the provided features, I will induce a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 to classify whether the outcome of labor negotiations is good or bad.

After analyzing the features, I have selected the most important ones for the decision tree. Here is the resulting tree:

|--- wage increase in first year of contract <= 4
||--- number of paid vacation days == generous
|||--- class: good
||--- number of paid vacation days != generous
|||--- class: bad
|--- wage increase in first year of contract > 4
||--- employer contributions to pension plan == employee contribution
|||--- class: good
||--- employer contributions to pension plan != employee contribution
|||--- class: bad

In this tree, the features used are:

* Wage increase in first year of contract (<= 4 or > 4)
* Number of paid vacation days (generous or not generous)
* Employer contributions to pension plan (employee contribution or other)

The decision tree suggests that if the wage increase in the first year is relatively low (<= 4), then a generous number of paid vacation days is required for a good outcome. If the wage increase is higher (> 4), then having an employee contribution to the pension plan is associated with a good outcome.

Please note that this decision tree is based on my analysis and may not be optimal or unique, as there might be other valid trees using different feature combinations.

Here is the Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.5
    nodes[1] = X["vacation"] == "gnr"
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        if X["pension"] == "empl_contr":
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values. The function first evaluates the conditions of the inner nodes and stores the results in the `nodes` list. Then, it uses these results to make a prediction about whether the outcome of labor negotiations is good (1) or bad (0). Finally, it returns the prediction along with the `nodes` list.

Note that I have used the thresholds 4.5 for "wage increase first year" and "gnr" for "vacation", as well as "empl_contr" for "pension". These values are based on my previous analysis of the decision tree, but you may need to adjust them if your data has different characteristics.
