Based on the provided features, I'll build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 to predict whether the outcome of labor negotiations is good or bad. Since we don't have the actual data, I'll make some assumptions about feature importance and relationships between features.

Assuming that wage increases and employer contributions are more important factors in determining the outcome of labor negotiations, I'll select the following features for the decision tree:

1. Wage increase in first year of contract (2 to 7)
2. Employer's contribution towards the health plan (none / half / full)

Here is the induced decision tree:
```
|--- wage increase in first year of contract <= 4
||--- employer's contribution towards the health plan == none
|||--- class: bad
||--- employer's contribution towards the health plan != none
|||--- class: good
|--- wage increase in first year of contract > 4
||--- class: good
```
This decision tree suggests that:

* If the wage increase in the first year is 4% or less, and there is no employer contribution to the health plan, the outcome is likely bad.
* If the wage increase in the first year is 4% or less, but there is an employer contribution to the health plan (half or full), the outcome is likely good.
* If the wage increase in the first year is more than 4%, the outcome is likely good regardless of the employer's contribution to the health plan.

Please note that this decision tree is based on assumptions and may not accurately represent real-world relationships between features. To build a more accurate model, actual data would be necessary.

Here is the Python function that represents the decision tree:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.5
    nodes[1] = X["contribution to health plan"] != "none"
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
```
This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values. The function returns a tuple containing the predicted outcome (`prediction`) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes (`nodes`).

Note that I've used the threshold value 4.5 for the "wage increase first year" feature, which is a reasonable midpoint between the minimum (2.0) and maximum (7.0) values. You can adjust this threshold value if needed.

Also, I've assumed that the "contribution to health plan" feature has three possible values: "none", "half", and "full". If the actual values are different, you may need to modify the comparison in the `nodes[1]` assignment.
