To induce a decision tree classifier based on the provided features for classifying whether the outcome of labor negotiations is good or bad, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Feature Selection**: Since we're aiming for a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, we should prioritize the most important features that contribute to the classification of the outcome as good or bad.

2. **Decision Tree Construction**: We will manually construct a simple decision tree using logical deductions based on typical labor negotiation outcomes and the provided features.

Given the complexity and variety of the features, let's simplify our approach by selecting features that are likely to have a significant impact on the perception of the outcome as good or bad:

- **Wage increase in first year of contract**: A higher wage increase is generally seen as beneficial.
- **Number of paid vacation days**: Generous vacation time is typically viewed positively.

Let's construct a basic decision tree with these considerations and the maximum depth of 2:

1. **Root Node (Depth 0)**: Wage increase in first year of contract
   - **Decision**: Wage increase <= 4 vs. Wage increase > 4

2. **Left Child (Depth 1)**: If Wage increase <= 4, then consider Number of paid vacation days
   - **Decision**: Below average / average vs. generous

3. **Right Child (Depth 1)**: If Wage increase > 4, then also consider Number of paid vacation days for further distinction
   - **Decision**: Below average / average vs. generous

**Decision Tree:**

|--- Wage increase in first year <= 4
||--- Number of paid vacation days: below average / average
|||--- class: bad (due to lower wage increase and less vacation time)
||--- Number of paid vacation days: generous
|||--- class: good (generous vacation despite lower initial wage increase)

|--- Wage increase in first year > 4
||--- Number of paid vacation days: below average / average
|||--- class: good (higher wage increase compensates for less vacation)
||--- Number of paid vacation days: generous
|||--- class: good (both higher wage and generous vacation)

This decision tree is a simplified model based on two key features. In real-world applications, the construction of such trees would ideally be guided by data analysis techniques to determine feature importance and the best splits for classification purposes.

Here is a Python function that represents the decision tree and returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether the outcome of labor negotiations is good or bad based on a decision tree.

    Args:

            - duration (int): Duration of agreement [1..7]
            - wage increase first year (float): Wage increase in first year of contract [2.0 .. 7.0]
            - wage increase second year (float): Age increase in second year of contract [2.0 .. 7.0]
            - wage increase third year (float): Wage increase in third year of contract [2.0 .. 7.0]
            - cost of living adjustment (str): Cost of living allowance [none, tcf, tc]
            - working hours (int): Number of working hours during week [35 .. 40]
            - pension (str): Employer contributions to pension plan [none, ret_allw, empl_contr]
            - standby pay (int): Standby pay [2 .. 25]

            - contribution to health plan (str): Employer's contribution towards the health plan [none, half, full]

    Returns:

```

This function uses the `wage increase first year` and `vacation` features to make a prediction about the outcome of labor negotiations. The decision tree has two inner nodes: one for the wage increase threshold and another for the vacation generosity. The function returns both the predicted outcome (0 = bad, 1 = good) and the truth values of the inner nodes as a list of integers (1 for True, 0 for False).
