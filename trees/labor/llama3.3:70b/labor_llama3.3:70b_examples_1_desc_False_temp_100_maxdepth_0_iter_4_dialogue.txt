To build a decision tree for classifying the outcome of labor negotiations as good or bad based on the provided features, we need to follow a series of steps. However, without actual data and outcomes, I'll guide you through a conceptual approach to building such a tree.

1. **Data Preparation**: The first step involves preparing your dataset. Ensure all categorical variables (like cost of living adjustment, employer contributions to pension plan, education allowance, etc.) are encoded into numerical values if necessary, for easier processing. Some decision tree algorithms can handle categorical data directly.

2. **Feature Selection**: Identify the most relevant features that significantly affect the outcome of labor negotiations. This could involve statistical analysis or domain knowledge about which factors typically influence negotiation outcomes. For simplicity, let's assume we select a subset of features based on their potential impact:
   - Wage increase in the first year
   - Cost of living adjustment
   - Number of working hours during the week
   - Employer contributions to pension plan
   - Standby pay

3. **Decision Tree Construction**: Without specific data, I'll describe a hypothetical decision tree based on these selected features.

### Hypothetical Decision Tree:

- **Root Node**: Wage increase in the first year <= 4%
  - **Left Child (Good Outcome)**: If cost of living adjustment is "total compensation adjustment" AND number of working hours during the week <= 37
    - Further split based on employer contributions to pension plan:
      - If "retirement allowance included", classify as good.
      - Else, check standby pay:
        - Standby pay > 10, classify as good.
        - Otherwise, classify as bad.
  - **Right Child (Potential Bad Outcome)**: Wage increase in the first year > 4%
    - Check employer contributions to pension plan:
      - If "none", classify as bad.
      - Else, check number of working hours during the week:
        - If > 38, classify as bad.
        - Otherwise, further split based on standby pay:
          - Standby pay <= 5, classify as bad.
          - Standby pay > 5 AND cost of living adjustment is "temporary cost of living adjustment formula" or better, classify as good.

### Explanation:

- **Wage Increase**: The tree starts with the wage increase in the first year because it's a direct financial benefit. A lower increase might lead to further scrutiny of other benefits.
- **Cost of Living Adjustment**: This feature directly impacts the purchasing power of employees' salaries over time, making it crucial for long-term satisfaction.
- **Working Hours**: The number of working hours affects work-life balance and overall job satisfaction.
- **Pension Plan Contributions**: Employer contributions to pension plans are a significant benefit, indicating investment in employees' futures.
- **Standby Pay**: This can be seen as a measure of how much the employer values readiness and flexibility among employees.

### Note:

This decision tree is highly speculative without actual data. Real-world application requires:
- Collecting and analyzing historical negotiation data.
- Possibly applying feature selection techniques (e.g., mutual information, correlation analysis) to identify the most impactful features.
- Training a decision tree classifier on this data and tuning its parameters for optimal performance.

Decision trees can be built using various algorithms like ID3, C4.5, or CART, each with its strengths in handling different types of data and scenarios. Tools like scikit-learn in Python provide implementations of these algorithms that can be used to build and refine decision trees based on real datasets.

Here's how the decision tree could be implemented in Python based on the given features and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a labor negotiation outcome is good or bad.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values.
            - duration: duration of agreement [1..7]
            - wage increase first year: wage increase in first year of contract [2.0 .. 7.0]
            - cost of living adjustment: cost of living allowance [none, tcf, tc]
            - working hours: number of working hours during week [35 .. 40]
            - pension: employer contributions to pension plan [none, ret_allw, empl_contr]
            - standby pay: standby pay [2 .. 25]

    Returns:
        prediction (int): The predicted outcome (0 = bad, 1 = good).
        nodes (list): A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """

    # Initialize the list to store node conditions
    nodes = 6 * [None]

    # Check if wage increase in first year is greater than or equal to 4.0
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] >= 4.0

    # If wage increase is sufficient, check cost of living adjustment
    nodes[1] = (X["cost of living adjustment"] == "tcf") or (X["cost of living adjustment"] == "tc")

    # Check working hours condition
    nodes[2] = X["working hours"] <= 37

    # Evaluate pension contribution
    nodes[3] = (X["pension"] == "ret_allw") or (X["pension"] == "empl_contr")

    # Standby pay check
    nodes[4] = X["standby pay"] > 10

    # Final node condition based on multiple factors
    nodes[5] = (nodes[3]) and (nodes[2])

    # Determine prediction based on conditions
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Good outcome with sufficient wage increase and cost of living adjustment
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Good outcome if standby pay is high
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Bad outcome without sufficient conditions met
    else:
        if nodes[5]:
            prediction = 1  # Good outcome with favorable pension and working hours
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Bad outcome

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]

# Example usage:
features = {
    "duration": 3,
    "wage increase first year": 4.5,
    "cost of living adjustment": "tcf",
    "working hours": 36,
    "pension": "ret_allw",
    "standby pay": 12
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This implementation defines a decision tree based on the provided features and returns both the prediction (good or bad outcome) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The `predict` function uses conditional statements to evaluate the feature values against predefined thresholds, mimicking the structure of a decision tree.
