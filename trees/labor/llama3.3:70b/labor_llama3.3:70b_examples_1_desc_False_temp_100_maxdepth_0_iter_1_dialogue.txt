To build a decision tree that classifies whether the outcome of labor negotiations is good or bad based on the provided features, we'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Feature Selection**: Identify the most relevant features that contribute to the outcome.
2. **Decision Tree Construction**: Use a recursive partitioning approach to construct the tree.

Given the complexity and variety of the features, let's first narrow down to the most likely influential ones on labor negotiation outcomes:

- **Duration of Agreement**: Longer agreements might be seen as more stable but less flexible.
- **Wage Increase in First Year**: Immediate financial benefits can significantly impact the perception of a "good" outcome.
- **Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA)**: Protects against inflation, crucial for long-term financial stability.
- **Standby Pay and Shift Differential**: These directly affect take-home pay and job attractiveness.
- **Employer Contributions to Pension Plan**: Significant for long-term security and employee retention.

For simplicity, let's categorize the outcome as "good" if it offers substantial immediate benefits (high wage increase in the first year), good long-term financial security (strong pension plan contributions, COLA), and favorable working conditions (generous standby pay, shift differential). Otherwise, it's considered "bad".

Here's a simplified decision tree based on these considerations:

1. **Wage Increase in First Year <= 4**  
   - **Employer Contributions to Pension Plan = none**  
     - Class: Bad (Low immediate benefit and no long-term security)
   - **Employer Contributions to Pension Plan != none**  
     - **Cost of Living Adjustment = none**  
       - Class: Bad (Some long-term security but vulnerable to inflation)
     - **Cost of Living Adjustment != none**  
       - Class: Good (Combination of some immediate benefit, long-term security, and protection against inflation)

2. **Wage Increase in First Year > 4**  
   - **Standby Pay <= 10**  
     - **Shift Differential <= 10**  
       - Class: Bad (Despite higher wage increase, poor working conditions)
     - **Shift Differential > 10**  
       - Class: Good (High immediate benefit and favorable working conditions)
   - **Standby Pay > 10**  
     - Class: Good (High immediate benefits and good working conditions)

This decision tree simplifies the complex interactions between various features of labor negotiations to predict whether an outcome is "good" or "bad". Real-world applications might require more nuanced and data-driven approaches, including machine learning algorithms trained on historical data to optimize feature selection and tree construction.

Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting whether a labor negotiation outcome is good or bad based on the provided features.

```python
def predict_labor_outcome(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a labor negotiation outcome is good (1) or bad (0)
    based on the input features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values.
        - duration (int): Duration of agreement [1..7]
        - wage increase first year (float): Wage increase in first year of contract [2.0 .. 7.0]
        - cost of living adjustment (str): Cost of living allowance [none, tcf, tc]
        - pension (str): Employer contributions to pension plan [none, ret_allw, empl_contr]
        - standby pay (int): Standby pay [2 .. 25]
        - shift differential (int): Supplement for work on II and III shift [1 .. 25]
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the predicted outcome (0 or 1) and a list of node values.
    """

    # Initialize the nodes list with None
    nodes = 5 * [None]

    # Node 0: Wage increase in first year <= 4
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4

    # Node 1: Employer contributions to pension plan is not none
    nodes[1] = X["pension"] != "none"

    # Node 2: Cost of living adjustment is not none
    nodes[2] = X["cost of living adjustment"] != "none"

    # Node 3: Standby pay > 10
    nodes[3] = X["standby pay"] > 10

    # Node 4: Shift differential > 10
    nodes[4] = X["shift differential"] > 10

    # Make predictions based on node values
    if not nodes[0]:  # Wage increase in first year > 4
        prediction = 1  # Good outcome
    else:
        if nodes[1] and nodes[2]:  # Pension plan is not none and COLA is not none
            prediction = 1  # Good outcome
        elif nodes[3] and nodes[4]:  # Standby pay > 10 and shift differential > 10
            prediction = 1  # Good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Bad outcome

    # Convert node values to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    node_values = [int(node) if node is not None else None for node in nodes]

    return prediction, node_values


# Example usage
features = {
    "duration": 5,
    "wage increase first year": 4.5,
    "cost of living adjustment": "tcf",
    "pension": "ret_allw",
    "standby pay": 12,
    "shift differential": 15,
}

outcome, node_values = predict_labor_outcome(features)
print("Predicted outcome:", outcome)
print("Node values:", node_values)

```

This function implements a simplified decision tree based on the provided features. It uses threshold values to determine whether the wage increase in the first year is sufficient, and whether the employer contributions to the pension plan and cost of living adjustment are adequate. The standby pay and shift differential are also considered in determining the outcome.

Note that this is a highly simplified example and actual labor negotiation outcomes may depend on many more factors and complexities not captured here.
