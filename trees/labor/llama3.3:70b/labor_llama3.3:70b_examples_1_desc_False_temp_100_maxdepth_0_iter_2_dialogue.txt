To build a decision tree classifier based on the given features that classify whether the outcome of labor negotiations is good or bad, we first need to determine which features are most relevant. Since the problem doesn't provide explicit data but rather lists potential features and their possible values, I'll create a hypothetical decision-making process based on common logical deductions about what might make labor negotiation outcomes "good" or "bad." 

Given the complexity and variety of factors influencing labor negotiations, we will prioritize features that directly impact employee compensation and benefits. Thus, wage increases, cost of living adjustments, employer contributions to pension plans, standby pay, shift differentials, education allowances, vacation days, and health plan contributions could be considered critical.

Here's a simplified decision tree based on these assumptions:

1. **Wage Increase in First Year of Contract**:
   - If the wage increase is 5% or more (assuming higher increases indicate better negotiation outcomes), proceed to evaluate additional benefits.
   - If the wage increase is less than 5%, consider the outcome as potentially "bad" due to lower financial gains.

2. **Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA)**:
   - Presence of a total compensation adjustment indicates a strong protection against inflation, suggesting a "good" outcome.
   - Temporary or no COLA might indicate a less favorable agreement, leaning towards a "bad" outcome.

3. **Employer Contributions to Pension Plan**:
   - Full employer contribution signifies a significant long-term benefit, indicating a "good" negotiation outcome.
   - No employer contribution suggests fewer benefits, potentially leading to a "bad" classification.

4. **Number of Paid Vacation Days**:
   - Generous vacation days contribute to work-life balance and employee satisfaction, suggesting a "good" outcome.
   - Below-average vacation days might indicate less consideration for employee well-being, leaning towards a "bad" outcome.

5. **Employer's Contribution Towards the Health Plan**:
   - Full employer contribution to health plans is a significant benefit, indicating a "good" negotiation outcome.
   - No or partial contribution could suggest less comprehensive benefits, potentially leading to a "bad" classification.

Given these considerations, a simplified decision tree might look like this:

- **Root Node**: Wage Increase in First Year
  - **<= 4%**: Bad Outcome (Low initial wage increase)
  - **> 4%**:
    - **Cost of Living Adjustment**: Total Compensation Adjustment -> Good Outcome
      - Else:
        - **Employer Contributions to Pension Plan**: Full Contribution -> Good Outcome
          - Else:
            - **Number of Paid Vacation Days**: Generous -> Good Outcome
              - Else:
                - **Employer's Contribution Towards the Health Plan**: Full Contribution -> Good Outcome
                  - Else: Bad Outcome (Lacking in comprehensive benefits)

This tree prioritizes immediate financial gains, protection against inflation, long-term financial security through pension plans, work-life balance through vacation days, and health benefits. Each subsequent decision further refines the classification based on additional benefits that might offset lesser gains in previous categories.

Please note, this is a highly simplified example and actual decision-making would require specific data points and potentially more nuanced considerations of how different factors interplay to influence negotiation outcomes. The thresholds used (e.g., 5% wage increase) are arbitrary and chosen for illustrative purposes. Real-world analysis would involve statistical methods to determine the most predictive features and their optimal threshold values.

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting labor negotiation outcomes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a labor negotiation outcome is good (1) or bad (0)
    based on given features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing feature values.
            - duration (int): Duration of agreement [1..7]
            - wage increase first year (float): Wage increase in first year of contract [2.0 .. 7.0]
            - cost of living adjustment (str): Cost of living allowance [none, tcf, tc]
            - pension (str): Employer contributions to pension plan [none, ret_allw, empl_contr]
            - vacation (str): Number of paid vacation days [ba, avg, gnr]
            - contribution to health plan (str): Employer's contribution towards the health plan [none, half, full]

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (int) and a list of node truth values.
    """

    # Initialize nodes with None
    nodes = 5 * [None]

    # Node 0: Wage increase in first year > 4.5
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] > 4.5

    # Node 1: Cost of living adjustment is 'tc'
    nodes[1] = X["cost of living adjustment"] == "tc"

    # Node 2: Pension plan contribution is 'ret_allw' or 'empl_contr'
    nodes[2] = X["pension"] in ["ret_allw", "empl_contr"]

    # Node 3: Vacation days are 'gnr'
    nodes[3] = X["vacation"] == "gnr"

    # Node 4: Contribution to health plan is 'full'
    nodes[4] = X["contribution to health plan"] == "full"

    prediction = 0

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        elif nodes[2]:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1
            elif nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1

    # Convert boolean node values to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    node_values = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, node_values


# Example usage:
features = {
    "duration": 5,
    "wage increase first year": 5.2,
    "wage increase second year": 4.8,
    "wage increase third year": 4.5,
    "cost of living adjustment": "tc",
    "working hours": 38,
    "pension": "ret_allw",
    "standby pay": 10,
    "shift differential": 15,
    "education allowance": True,
    "statutory holidays": 12,
    "vacation": "gnr",
    "longterm disability assistance": True,
    "contribution to dental plan": "half",
    "bereavement assistance": False,

prediction, node_values = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Node values: {node_values}")
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values as input and returns a tuple with the predicted outcome (0 or 1) and a list of boolean node values. The decision tree is based on the features provided, prioritizing wage increase, cost of living adjustment, pension plan contribution, vacation days, and health plan contribution.

The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with sample feature values and print the prediction and node values.
