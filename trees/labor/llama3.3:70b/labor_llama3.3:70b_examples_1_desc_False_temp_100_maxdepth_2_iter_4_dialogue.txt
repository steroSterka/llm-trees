To build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 for classifying whether the outcome of labor negotiations is good or bad based on the provided features, we first need to select the most important features. Since the actual data and the classification criteria (what makes an outcome "good" or "bad") are not provided, I'll simulate a process based on common practices in machine learning.

Given the large number of features, a real-world approach would involve either dimensionality reduction techniques or feature selection methods to identify the most impactful features. For simplicity and without actual data to analyze, let's consider a hypothetical scenario where we've identified the top features through mutual information or correlation analysis:

1. **Wage increase in first year of contract** - This could be a significant factor as it directly affects employees' immediate financial situation.
2. **Number of paid vacation days** - Reflects work-life balance, which is crucial for employee satisfaction.
3. **Employer contributions to pension plan** - Indicates long-term financial security, an important aspect of job satisfaction.

Let's assume these are among the most influential features based on preliminary analysis.

### Decision Tree with Maximum Depth of 2

- **Root Node**: Wage increase in first year of contract
    - **Less than or equal to 4%**: This threshold is chosen as it represents a moderate increase, potentially below inflation rates in some contexts.
        - **Number of paid vacation days is generous**: If the wage increase is modest but vacation days are generous, this could balance out employee satisfaction.
            - Class: Good outcome
        - **Number of paid vacation days is not generous**: Low wage increase coupled with limited vacation time might lead to dissatisfaction.
            - Class: Bad outcome
    - **Greater than 4%**:
        - **Employer contributions to pension plan are full**: A significant wage increase combined with comprehensive pension contributions could indicate a very favorable agreement for employees.
            - Class: Good outcome
        - **Employer contributions to pension plan are not full**: While the wage increase is good, limited pension contributions might affect long-term job security perceptions.
            - Class: Bad outcome

### Decision Tree Representation:

|--- Wage increase in first year of contract <= 4
||--- Number of paid vacation days = generous
|||--- class: Good outcome
||--- Number of paid vacation days != generous
|||--- class: Bad outcome
|--- Wage increase in first year of contract > 4
||--- Employer contributions to pension plan = full
|||--- class: Good outcome
||--- Employer contributions to pension plan != full
|||--- class: Bad outcome

This hypothetical decision tree is built based on assumed feature importance and thresholds. In a real-world scenario, actual data analysis (including the classification of outcomes as "good" or "bad") would be necessary to determine the most impactful features and optimal decision thresholds accurately.

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting labor negotiation outcomes based on given features. This example uses thresholds and conditions derived from the problem description.

```python
def predict_labor_outcome(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the outcome of labor negotiations (good or bad) based on given features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing feature values for a single instance.
    
    Returns:
    prediction (int): 0 if the outcome is predicted as "bad", 1 if "good".
    nodes (list): List of boolean values representing whether each inner node condition is met.
    """
    
    # Initialize list to hold node truth values
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Check wage increase in first year and set the first node value
    nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] <= 4.5
    
    # Depending on the outcome of the first check, decide which feature to use for the second level
    if nodes[0]:
        # If wage increase is moderate or low, consider vacation days as a deciding factor
        nodes[1] = X['vacation'] == 'gnr'  # 'gnr' stands for generous
    else:
        # If wage increase is high, consider employer contributions to pension plan
        nodes[1] = X['pension'] == 'empl_contr'  # Assuming 'empl_contr' is a favorable condition
    
    # Make prediction based on node values
    if nodes[0]:
        # Low or moderate wage increase, but generous vacation days could make it good
        prediction = int(nodes[1])  # Good outcome if vacation is generous
    else:
        # High wage increase, pension contribution affects the outcome
        prediction = int(nodes[1])  # Good outcome if pension contribution is favorable
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]

# Example usage
example_features = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 4.0,
    'wage increase second year': 5.0,
    'wage increase third year': 6.0,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'none',
    'working hours': 37,
    'pension': 'empl_contr',
    'standby pay': 10,
    'shift differential': 15,
    'education allowance': False,
    'statutory holidays': 12,
    'vacation': 'gnr',  # Generous vacation
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'half',
    'bereavement assistance': False,
    'contribution to health plan': 'full'
}

prediction, nodes = predict_labor_outcome(example_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This function assumes certain thresholds and feature values based on the problem description. Adjustments might be necessary depending on the actual data distribution and desired outcomes. The example usage at the end demonstrates how to call this function with a set of features and print out the prediction and node truth values.
