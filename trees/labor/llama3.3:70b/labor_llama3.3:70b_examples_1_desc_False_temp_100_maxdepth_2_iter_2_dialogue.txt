To build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 that classifies whether the outcome of labor negotiations is good or bad based on the given features, we first need to identify the most important features. Since the actual importance of each feature isn't provided in your query, and without access to specific data or outcomes (good/bad) associated with these features, I'll guide you through a conceptual approach.

Let's assume that after analyzing the data, the top two most influential features for determining the outcome of labor negotiations are:
1. **Wage increase in first year of contract** - This feature could significantly impact the perception of negotiation success, as it directly affects employees' immediate financial situation.
2. **Cost of living adjustment (CLA)** - The presence and type of CLA can greatly influence the long-term value of the contract to employees, making it a critical factor.

Given these assumptions, here's how we might construct a simple decision tree with a maximum depth of 2:

### Decision Tree

|--- Wage increase in first year of contract <= 4
    |--- Cost of living adjustment == total compensation adjustment
        |--- Class: Good (Outcome suggests significant financial benefits to employees)
    |--- Cost of living adjustment != total compensation adjustment
        |--- Class: Bad (Limited or no protection against inflation, potentially less favorable outcome)

|--- Wage increase in first year of contract > 4
    |--- Cost of living adjustment == total compensation adjustment
        |--- Class: Good (High initial wage increase combined with comprehensive cost of living adjustments likely leads to a very favorable outcome)
    |--- Cost of living adjustment != total compensation adjustment
        |--- Class: Bad (Despite higher initial wage increase, lack of robust cost of living adjustment may diminish long-term benefits)

This decision tree focuses on the wage increase in the first year as the primary splitter because it directly impacts employees' immediate financial situation. The cost of living adjustment is used as the secondary feature to further refine the classification, considering its implications for the contract's long-term value.

**Note:** This example simplifies the process and assumes binary classifications (Good/Bad) based on two features. In practice, building an accurate decision tree would require analyzing actual data, possibly involving more features, and potentially using techniques like cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance. The choice of features and thresholds would depend on the specific characteristics of your dataset and the goals of your analysis.

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree based on your requirements. The function takes in a dictionary `X` representing the features and returns a tuple containing the predicted outcome of labor negotiations (0 for bad, 1 for good) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the outcome of labor negotiations based on given features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing the feature values.
             'wage increase first year': wage increase in first year of contract [2.0 .. 7.0]
             'cost of living adjustment': cost of living allowance [none, tcf, tc]
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the predicted outcome (0 for bad, 1 for good) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    # Initialize the inner node truth values
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Define the threshold for wage increase in first year
    wage_increase_threshold = 4.5
    
    # Define the cost of living adjustment thresholds
    cla_good_values = ['tcf', 'tc']
    
    # Calculate the truth values for the inner nodes
    nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] <= wage_increase_threshold
    nodes[1] = X['cost of living adjustment'] in cla_good_values
    
    # Make predictions based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0 if not nodes[1] else 1
    else:
        prediction = 1
    
    # Convert boolean values to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
features = {
    'duration': 5,
    'wage increase first year': 4.2,
    'wage increase second year': 3.5,
    'wage increase third year': 4.0,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'tcf',
    'working hours': 38,
    'pension': 'none',
    'standby pay': 10,
    'shift differential': 12,
    'education allowance': False,
    'statutory holidays': 11,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'half',
    'bereavement assistance': True,
    'contribution to health plan': 'full'
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Predicted outcome:", prediction)
print("Inner node truth values:", nodes)

```

In this code:

*   We define the `predict` function that takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values.
*   The function calculates the truth values for two inner nodes based on the 'wage increase first year' and 'cost of living adjustment' features.
*   It then makes predictions using these node values according to the decision tree logic.
*   Finally, it returns the predicted outcome (0 for bad, 1 for good) along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

You can replace the `features` dictionary in the example usage section with your actual data and run the code to get predictions.
