To induce a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2, I will first select the most important features and then build the tree. Since this is a text-based interface, I'll use my understanding to simulate the process.

**Feature Selection:**
For simplicity, let's assume that after analyzing the data, the top three most important features for determining whether the outcome of labor negotiations is good or bad are:
1. **Wage increase in first year of contract (2 to 7)** - This directly impacts employees' immediate financial situations.
2. **Number of paid vacation days (below average / average / generous)** - Reflects on work-life balance and employee benefits.
3. **Employer contributions to pension plan (none / retirement allowance included / employee contribution)** - Affects long-term financial security for employees.

**Decision Tree Construction:**
Given the maximum depth of 2, our tree will have a root node that splits based on one feature, and each child of the root can further split once based on another feature.

Let's construct the decision tree:

1. **Root Node Split:** Wage increase in first year of contract (2 to 7)
   - **Left Child (Wage increase <= 4):** Indicates lower initial wage growth.
   - **Right Child (Wage increase > 4):** Indicates higher initial wage growth.

2. **Left Child Split (Wage increase <= 4):** Number of paid vacation days
   - **Left Grandchild (Below average):** Less generous vacation policy, likely a bad outcome.
     - **Class:** Bad
   - **Right Grandchild (Average or Generous):** More generous vacation policy, could be a good outcome considering other benefits might compensate for lower wage growth.
     - **Class:** Good

3. **Right Child Split (Wage increase > 4):** Employer contributions to pension plan
   - **Left Grandchild (None or Employee contribution):** Less favorable long-term financial support, despite higher initial wages.
     - **Class:** Bad
   - **Right Grandchild (Retirement allowance included):** More favorable long-term financial support, combined with higher wage growth.
     - **Class:** Good

**Decision Tree:**
```
|--- Wage increase in first year <= 4
||--- Number of paid vacation days: Below average
|||--- Class: Bad
||--- Number of paid vacation days: Average or Generous
|||--- Class: Good
|--- Wage increase in first year > 4
||--- Employer contributions to pension plan: None or Employee contribution
|||--- Class: Bad
||--- Employer contributions to pension plan: Retirement allowance included
|||--- Class: Good
```

This decision tree uses the selected features to classify the outcome of labor negotiations as good or bad based on initial wage increases, vacation days, and employer pension contributions.

Here is a Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a labor negotiation outcome is good (1) or bad (0)
    based on the provided features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values.
              The keys are the feature names, and the values are the corresponding feature values.
              
    Returns:
    prediction (int): The predicted class label (0 = bad, 1 = good).
    nodes (list): A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """
    
    # Initialize the nodes list with None values
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Split at the root node based on wage increase in first year
    nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] <= 4
    
    # Split at the left child node based on number of paid vacation days if wage increase is low
    # and at the right child node based on employer contributions to pension plan if wage increase is high
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X['vacation'] != 'ba'  # ba means below average, so we check for not ba (average or generous)
    else:
        nodes[1] = X['pension'] == 'ret_allw'  # ret_allw means retirement allowance included
    
    # Make the prediction based on the node values
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Good outcome: low wage increase but generous vacation days
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Bad outcome: low wage increase and below average vacation days
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Good outcome: high wage increase and retirement allowance included
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Bad outcome: high wage increase but no retirement allowance
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

You can use this function by passing a dictionary `X` containing the feature values. The function returns the predicted class label (0 or 1) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Example usage:

```python
features = {
    'duration': 5,
    'wage increase first year': 3.5,
    'wage increase second year': 4.2,
    'wage increase third year': 4.8,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'none',
    'working hours': 38,
    'pension': 'empl_contr',
    'standby pay': 15,
    'shift differential': 10,
    'education allowance': False,
    'statutory holidays': 12,
    'vacation': 'avg',  # average
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'half',
    'bereavement assistance': False,
    'contribution to health plan': 'full'
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f'Predicted class label: {prediction}')
print(f'Inner node values: {nodes}')
```
