To build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 for classifying whether the outcome of labor negotiations is good or bad based on the provided features, we first need to determine which features are most important. Since the actual dataset and target variable (good or bad outcome) details are not provided, I'll guide you through a general approach using Python with scikit-learn library, assuming we have a dataset where each feature is represented by its respective name, and there's a target variable named "outcome" which can be either "good" or "bad".

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Assuming this is your dataset loaded into a DataFrame named 'df'
# df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

# Encoding categorical variables (example for cost_of_living_adjustment)
le = LabelEncoder()
df['cost_of_living_adjustment'] = le.fit_transform(df['cost_of_living_adjustment'])
df['employer_contributions_to_pension_plan'] = le.fit_transform(df['employer_contributions_to_pension_plan'])
df['education_allowance'] = le.fit_transform(df['education_allowance'])
df['number_of_paid_vacation_days'] = le.fit_transform(df['number_of_paid_vacation_days'])
df['employer_help_during_employee_longterm_disability'] = le.fit_transform(df['employer_help_during_employee_longterm_disability'])
df['employers_contribution_towards_the_dental_plan'] = le.fit_transform(df['employers_contribution_towards_the_dental_plan'])
df['employers_financial_contribution_towards_the_covering_the_costs_of_bereavement'] = le.fit_transform(df['employers_financial_contribution_towards_the_covering_the_costs_of_bereavement'])
df['employers_contribution_towards_the_health_plan'] = le.fit_transform(df['employers_contribution_towards_the_health_plan'])

# Define features (X) and target variable (y)
X = df[['duration_of_agreement', 'wage_increase_in_first_year_of_contract',
        'wage_increase_in_second_year_of_contract', 'wage_increase_in_third_year_of_contract',
        'cost_of_living_adjustment', 'number_of_working_hours_during_week',
        'employer_contributions_to_pension_plan', 'standby_pay', 'shift_differencial_supplement_for_work_on_2_and_3_shift',
        'education_allowance', 'number_of_statutory_holidays', 'number_of_paid_vacation_days',
        'employer_help_during_employee_longterm_disability', 'employers_contribution_towards_the_dental_plan',
        'employers_financial_contribution_towards_the_covering_the_costs_of_bereavement',
        'employers_contribution_towards_the_health_plan']]
y = df['outcome']

# Split dataset into training set and test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=1)

# Create Decision Tree classifier with maximum depth of 2
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2, random_state=42)

# Train the model using the training sets
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the response for test dataset
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Model Accuracy: how often is the classifier correct?
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# To visualize or print the decision tree (simplified example)
from sklearn.tree import plot_tree
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))
plot_tree(clf, feature_names=X.columns, class_names=y.unique(), filled=True)
plt.show()
```

This script does the following:
- Loads necessary libraries.
- Encodes categorical variables (if your data is not already numerical).
- Splits the dataset into a training set and a test set.
- Creates a Decision Tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2.
- Trains the model using the training sets.
- Predicts the response for the test dataset.
- Prints accuracy and classification report to evaluate the model's performance.
- Optionally, plots the decision tree.

Note: The actual feature importance might vary based on your specific data. This example assumes all provided features are relevant and numerical or properly encoded. You may need to adjust encoding or preprocessing steps based on your dataset's specifics. Additionally, for real-world applications, consider tuning hyperparameters (e.g., `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, `min_samples_leaf`) using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV from scikit-learn for potentially better performance.

Based on the provided features and target variable, I will create a decision tree of depth 2. The conditions in this decision tree are based on general assumptions about labor negotiations and may need to be adjusted according to the actual data.

```

This code defines a decision tree with two inner nodes:
1. `wage increase first year >= 4.5`: This node checks if the wage increase in the first year is higher than or equal to 4.5%.
2. `cost of living adjustment > 0`: This node checks if there is any cost of living adjustment.

The prediction is made based on these two nodes:
- If both nodes are True, the outcome is good (1).
- If only one node is True, the outcome is still good (1), assuming that either a high wage increase or a cost of living adjustment is beneficial.
- If neither node is True, the outcome is bad (0).

Note: The thresholds used in this example (4.5 for `wage increase first year` and 0 for `cost of living adjustment`) are arbitrary and may need to be adjusted based on actual data and domain knowledge.
