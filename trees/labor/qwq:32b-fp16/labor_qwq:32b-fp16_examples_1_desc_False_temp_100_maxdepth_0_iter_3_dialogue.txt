<think>

Okay, so I need to build a decision tree classifier for labor negotiations outcomes (good or bad) based on the given features. Let me start by understanding the features provided. The features are various aspects of a labor agreement like duration, wage increases over three years, cost of living adjustments, working hours, pension contributions, standby pay, shift differentials, education allowance, statutory holidays, paid vacation days, employer help during disability, dental plan contributions, bereavement contributions, and health plan contributions.

First, I should think about which features are most likely to influence the outcome. Maybe the wage increases and cost of living adjustments are crucial because they directly affect employees' earnings. The duration of the agreement might also be important—longer agreements might be seen as more stable. Employer contributions to pension and health plans could be significant too, as benefits are a big part of negotiations.

Looking at the example given for the iris dataset, they used petal width as the first split. That suggests starting with the most important feature. For labor negotiations, perhaps the cost of living adjustment (COLA) is a key feature since it ties wages to inflation. If there's no COLA, that might lead to a bad outcome. Alternatively, the health plan contribution might be critical—if the employer doesn't contribute fully, that's a red flag.

Let me list possible features and their impact:

- **Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA):** If it's "none," that's bad. "Temporary" might be okay, but "total compensation adjustment" could be better.
- **Health Plan Contribution:** Full contribution is better, none is bad.
- **Duration of Agreement:** Longer durations (like 7 years) might be seen as good, while shorter (1 year) could be bad.
- **Wage Increases:** Higher wage increases in the first few years could lead to a good outcome, but maybe the trend matters. For example, if the first year is high but subsequent years drop, that might be bad.
- **Paid Vacation Days:** Generous vs. below average could influence satisfaction.
- **Employer Contributions to Pension:** If they don't contribute, that's bad.

I should consider the most impactful features first. Let's think of splitting points. Maybe starting with the Health Plan Contribution. If the employer contributes fully, that's a good sign, so maybe split there first. Alternatively, the COLA could be first. Let's say COLA is the first split.

Suppose the first split is on COLA:

- If COLA is "none", then outcome is more likely bad.
- If COLA is "temporary" or "total", then check other features.

Then, maybe the next split could be Health Plan Contribution. If it's "full", then good. If "half" or "none", then check other factors.

Alternatively, duration of agreement. If duration is 7 years (max), that's good. If 1, that's bad.

But maybe the combination of wage increases and COLA is key. For example, if the first year wage increase is high but without COLA, that might not be sustainable.

Alternatively, the number of paid vacation days: if "generous", that's a plus for good outcome.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should structure it step by step.

Let me try to outline a possible decision tree:

1. **First Split:** Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA)
   - If COLA is "none":
     - Then, check other factors like wage increases. Maybe if wage increases are low, outcome is bad. But without COLA, even high initial increases might not be enough, so maybe outcome is bad here.
   - If COLA is "temporary" or "total":
     - Next split could be on Health Plan Contribution.

Wait, perhaps the first split should be on Health Plan Contribution, since healthcare is a major concern. Let's try that:

1. **Health Plan Contribution**
   - If "full":
     - Outcome is likely good.
   - If "half" or "none":
     - Then check another feature, like COLA.

Alternatively, maybe the combination of COLA and Health Plan. Let's see.

Alternatively, looking at the example, they used a numerical feature first (petal width). Maybe here, some numerical features like wage increases can be used first. Let's look at wage increases in first year. Suppose the first split is on wage increase in first year:

- If first year wage increase is 7 (max), then maybe good.
- If lower, then check other factors.

But maybe the trend over three years matters. Like, if the first year is 7, second 6, third 5, that's a good progression. But how to represent that in a decision tree?

Alternatively, the total wage increase over three years? But the features are separate. Hmm, perhaps the maximum of the three years?

Alternatively, the average? But the features are individual years.

Alternatively, the first year's wage increase could be a key factor. Let me try:

First split on wage increase in first year (2-7):

- If first year wage increase is >= 6:
   - Then outcome is good?
- Else:
   - Split on another feature like COLA.

But maybe even with a high first year, without COLA, it's bad. So perhaps first COLA, then first year wage increase.

Alternatively, the most critical is the combination of COLA and health plan.

Alternatively, the example's decision tree used a numerical split (petal width <= 0.8). For the labor features, some are numerical (duration, wage increases, standby pay, etc.), others categorical.

Perhaps starting with a numerical feature like the wage increase in the first year. Let's say:

First split: wage increase in first year > 5?

If yes, maybe proceed to check other factors. If no, then maybe bad.

Alternatively, the duration of the agreement. A longer duration (e.g., 6-7 years) might be better.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to prioritize the features that are most likely to have a strong impact. Let me think of possible splits:

Suppose the first split is on the Health Plan Contribution:

- If "full" -> good outcome.
- If "half" -> check next feature.
- If "none" -> bad outcome.

But that might not capture all nuances. Alternatively, maybe the first split is on COLA:

- COLA none: then check wage increases. If wage increases are low, bad; even if high, maybe bad because no COLA.
- COLA temporary: then check health plan.
- COLA total: maybe good.

Alternatively, the most important feature is the combination of COLA and Health Plan. Maybe the first split is on COLA:

First split: COLA is "none"

- If "none" -> then check Health Plan Contribution:
   - If Health Plan is "none": bad
   - Else: maybe check wage increases.

Alternatively, this is getting too convoluted. Let me try to think of the example again. In the iris example, they split on petal width first because that's the most discriminative feature. For labor negotiations, perhaps the most discriminative is the health plan contribution, as that's a critical benefit.

Alternatively, the total compensation (wage increases plus benefits). But since it's a decision tree, we have to pick features one by one.

Alternatively, let's start with the Health Plan Contribution. Suppose the first split is on Health Plan Contribution:

- If Health Plan Contribution is "full": then outcome is likely good (class: good)
- If "half" or "none": then proceed to next feature.

Next feature could be COLA:

- Among those with Health Plan "half" or "none":
   - If COLA is "total" or "temporary": maybe check another feature like wage increases.
   - If COLA is "none": maybe check wage increases.

Alternatively, if Health Plan is "half", and COLA is "none", then outcome is bad.

Alternatively, after Health Plan, split on COLA:

Second split (for those with Health Plan not full):

- COLA "total" or "temporary" vs "none".

If COLA is "none", then maybe the outcome is more likely bad unless other factors compensate. So maybe third split on wage increases.

Alternatively, this is getting too deep. Let me try to structure this step by step.

Another approach: think of which features are more likely to have a binary split leading to a good or bad outcome.

- If the employer contributes nothing to the health plan, that's a bad sign. So if Health Plan Contribution is "none", outcome is probably bad.
- If they contribute "full", then good.
- If "half", then check other factors.

Similarly, if there's no COLA, that's bad. So first split could be Health Plan Contribution, then COLA.

Alternatively, the first split is on Health Plan Contribution:

1. Health Plan Contribution = "full"
   - Class: Good
2. Health Plan Contribution = "half"
   - Next split: COLA
      - COLA = "none" -> Bad
      - COLA "temporary" or "total" -> Check another feature like wage increase first year
3. Health Plan Contribution = "none"
   - Class: Bad

But this might not capture all. Alternatively, if Health Plan is "half" and COLA is "total", maybe still good.

Alternatively, let's say:

First split: Health Plan Contribution (full? yes/no)

- If full: Good
- If half or none:
   - Next split: COLA (none? yes/no)
      - If COLA is none: Bad
      - If COLA is temp or total:
          - Next split: wage increase first year >=6?
             - Yes: Good
             - No: Bad

But I'm making this up, but maybe that's a plausible structure.

Alternatively, considering numerical features like wage increases in first year. Maybe first split is on wage increase first year:

1. Wage increase first year >= 6:
   - Then check COLA:
      - If COLA is none: maybe average, but if wage is high, still good?
      - If COLA present: Good
   - Or maybe split further on Health Plan.

This is getting too speculative. Maybe I should structure it step by step, trying to pick the most important features first.

Alternatively, the duration of the agreement. A longer agreement (e.g., 7 years) might be a good sign, implying stability. So first split on duration:

- If duration >=6 years: Good
- Else:
   - Next split on Health Plan

But I don't know. Since I don't have actual data, I have to make assumptions.

Alternatively, the example used petal width because it's the most important for separating the classes. For labor negotiations, maybe the combination of COLA and health benefits are the top features.

Let me try building the decision tree step by step:

1. First Split: **Health Plan Contribution**
   - If "full":
     - Class: Good (since full coverage is a strong positive)
   - If "half" or "none":
     - Proceed to next split.

2. Second Split (for Health Plan not full): **Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA)**
   - If COLA is "none":
     - Class: Bad (no COLA and inadequate health benefits)
   - If COLA is "temporary" or "total":
     - Proceed to next split.

3. Third Split (COLA present but Health Plan not full): **Wage Increase in First Year** (numerical)
   - If first year wage increase >=6:
     - Class: Good (significant raise plus some COLA makes it good)
   - Else:
     - Proceed to next split.

4. Fourth Split (if first year wage <6 and COLA present but Health Plan not full): **Employer Contributions to Pension Plan**
   - If pension is "retirement allowance included" or "employee contribution" (i.e., some contribution):
     - Maybe check another feature like standby pay or vacation days.
   - If none:
     - Class: Bad (no pension and lower wage, even with COLA)

But this is getting too deep. Maybe a simpler approach:

First split on Health Plan Contribution (full=good), else:

Second split on COLA (none=bad), else:

Third split on wage increase first year (>=6=good), else:

Check something else, like duration.

Alternatively, another path:

1. COLA is "none" → Bad
2. COLA is present → Check Health Plan
   - Health Plan "full" → Good
   - Health Plan "half" or "none" → Check wage increases
      - First year wage >=6 → Good
      - Else → Bad

This way the tree is:

|--- COLA = none → class: Bad
|--- COLA = temporary or total
||--- Health Plan Contribution = full → class: Good
||--- Health Plan Contribution = half or none
||||--- wage increase first year >=6 → class: Good
||||--- wage increase first year <6 → class: Bad

This seems plausible. Let me check if that makes sense. If there's no COLA, bad. If there is COLA, then full health plan is good. If health is half or none, then check if the first year wage is high enough (maybe 6 or higher) to compensate, otherwise it's bad.

Alternatively, maybe the split on wage first year can be combined with other factors.

Alternatively, maybe after COLA and Health Plan, next is duration:

But since I have to choose, I'll go with the above structure.

Another consideration: The example's decision tree had three levels. Maybe keeping it to three splits:

First split on COLA (none?), then Health Plan, then wage.

Alternatively, the user's example used a numerical split (petal width <=0.8). So perhaps for the labor features, some numerical splits are needed.

Let me try:

1. **Health Plan Contribution**
   - If "full" → Good
   - Else:
     - Check **COLA**
         - If "none" → Bad
         - Else:
             - Check **Wage Increase First Year** (>=6)
                 - Yes → Good
                 - No → Bad

This would look like:

|--- Health Plan Contribution = full → class: Good
|--- Health Plan Contribution = half or none
||--- COLA = none → class: Bad
||--- COLA = temp or total
||||--- wage increase first year >=6 → class: Good
||||--- wage increase first year <6 → class: Bad

This is a three-level tree. It might be a good structure. Alternatively, maybe the first split is on COLA instead of Health Plan.

Alternatively, let's consider that Health Plan and COLA are both important. Maybe starting with COLA first:

1. **COLA**
   - If "none" → Bad
   - Else:
     - Check **Health Plan Contribution**
         - If "full" → Good
         - Else:
             - Check **Wage Increase First Year** (>=6 → Good, else Bad)

Which would be:

|--- COLA = none → class: Bad
|--- COLA = temp or total
||--- Health Plan Contribution = full → class: Good
||--- Health Plan Contribution = half or none
||||--- wage increase first year >=6 → class: Good
||||--- wage increase first year <6 → class: Bad

This might be better because COLA being present is a base requirement, then health plan, then wage.

Alternatively, maybe after Health Plan and COLA, instead of wage, another feature like the duration.

But since the user's example used a numerical split, I think including the wage increase as a numerical split is okay.

Alternatively, another path could involve the number of paid vacation days. If "generous" then good, but that's a categorical.

Alternatively, combining multiple factors. But without data, it's hard. The key is to choose the most impactful features first.

Another angle: If an employer offers no COLA and no health contribution, that's definitely bad. If they have COLA but poor health, maybe the wage can compensate.

Alternatively, the presence of COLA and health are the top two, then wage.

I think the structure I outlined above is logical. Let me see if there's another critical feature. For instance, the employer's contribution to the pension plan. If they don't contribute anything, that's a minus. Maybe that should come into play.

Suppose after COLA and Health Plan, if Health is half or none, then check pension contribution:

1. COLA = none → Bad
2. COLA present →
   a. Health full → Good
   b. Health half/none →
      i. Pension contribution = none → Bad
      ii. Pension contribution (retirement or employee) → check wage.

This adds another layer. Maybe that's better. So:

|--- COLA = none → Bad
|--- COLA present
||--- Health full → Good
||--- Health half/none
||||--- Pension contribution = none → Bad
||||--- Pension contribution present
||||||--- wage first year >=6 → Good
||||||--- <6 → Bad

This adds more depth but might better capture pension importance.

Alternatively, maybe pension isn't as critical as wage. It depends on priorities. Since I'm the one building this, I can choose, but maybe the user expects the most straightforward.

Alternatively, the example's tree had three levels. Let's stick with three levels:

First: COLA (none → bad)

Second: Health (full → good)

Third: Wage first year (>=6 → good, else bad)

Thus:

|--- COLA = none → class: Bad
|--- COLA = temp or total
||--- Health Plan Contribution = full → class: Good
||--- Health Plan Contribution = half or none
||||--- wage increase first year >=6 → class: Good
||||--- wage increase first year <6 → class: Bad

This seems a reasonable three-level tree. Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Health Plan.

Alternatively, the most important feature might be Health Plan, so first split there.

The user's example didn't have a clear order but used petal width first. Since in labor negotiations, health benefits and COLA are crucial, perhaps that's the way to go.

Final decision: I'll present the tree with COLA first, then Health, then wage.
</think>

Here is the decision tree structured to evaluate whether a labor negotiation outcome is considered "Good" or "Bad" based on critical factors:

---

### **Decision Tree for Labor Negotiation Outcome**

1. **First Split: Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA)**
   - **If COLA = "none"** → **Class: Bad**  
     *(No COLA indicates a lack of compensation adjustment for inflation, leading to a negative outcome.)*
   - **If COLA = "temporary" or "total"** → Proceed to next split.

2. **Second Split (if COLA is present): Health Plan Contribution**
   - **If Health Plan Contribution = "full"** → **Class: Good**  
     *(Full health coverage combined with COLA ensures comprehensive benefits.)*
   - **If Health Plan Contribution = "half" or "none"** → Proceed to next split.

3. **Third Split (if Health Plan is insufficient): Wage Increase in First Year**
   - **If Wage Increase First Year ≥ 6** → **Class: Good**  
     *(A significant first-year wage increase compensates for weaker health benefits and COLA.)*
   - **If Wage Increase First Year < 6** → **Class: Bad**  
     *(Low wage growth with inadequate health benefits and only partial COLA leads to a negative outcome.)*

---

### **Tree Structure in Text Format:**
```
|--- COLA = none → class: Bad
|--- COLA = temporary or total
||--- Health Plan Contribution = full → class: Good
||--- Health Plan Contribution = half or none
||||--- wage increase first year ≥6 → class: Good
||||--- wage increase first year <6 → class: Bad
```

---

### **Key Justifications:**
- **COLA First:** Ensures compensation keeps up with inflation, a foundational requirement.
- **Health Plan Next:** Full coverage is critical for long-term satisfaction; partial/no coverage requires compensation elsewhere.
- **Wage as a Safety Net:** A strong initial wage increase can offset weaker health benefits if COLA is in place.

This structure balances key financial and benefit considerations typical in labor negotiations.

<think>

Okay, I need to create a Python function based on the decision tree provided, but wait, the user hasn't actually given me the decision tree structure yet. Hmm, looking back at the problem statement, maybe I misread. The user mentioned formatting the decision tree as a Python function, but the actual tree isn't here. Wait, maybe the example they provided is part of the problem? Let me check again.

Oh right, the example given is for another problem (diabetes prediction), but the user wants me to do the same for their labor negotiation problem. Since the decision tree isn't provided here, perhaps I need to assume a hypothetical tree structure based on the features and target variable they described?

Alternatively, maybe there was a mistake and the decision tree details were supposed to be included. Since I can't ask for clarification, I'll have to proceed by creating a plausible decision tree structure using the features provided. The user mentioned "fill placeholders for thresholds with meaningful values," so I should choose thresholds that make sense for each feature.

Let me start by listing the features again to make sure. The features include:

- duration: 1-7
- wage increases for three years: 2.0-7.0 each
- cost of living adjustment: categories (none, tcf, tc)
- working hours: 35-40
- pension: none, ret_allw, empl_contr
- standby pay: 2-25
- shift differential: 1-25
- education allowance: true/false
- statutory holidays: 9-15
- vacation: ba, avg, gnr
- longterm disability assistance: true/false
- contribution to dental plan: none, half, full
- bereavement assistance: true/false
- contribution to health plan: none, half, full
- Target is 0 or 1.

Since the target is 0 or 1 (bad/good settlement), I need to structure the decision tree to split based on these features. The function needs to return the prediction and a list of node truth values.

First, I need to decide on the structure of the decision tree. Let me think of some logical splits. Maybe start with a feature that has a significant impact. For example, the wage increases. Let's say the first split is on 'wage increase first year' being above a certain value, like 5.0. If that's true, then maybe check another feature.

Alternatively, the duration of the agreement: maybe a longer duration (like >=5 years) is better. Or the cost of living adjustment: if it's 'tc', which might be better than 'tcf' or 'none'.

Wait, but the example uses numerical comparisons for continuous variables. For categorical variables like 'cost of living adjustment', which has values none, tcf, tc, I need to encode these as numbers or handle them with equality checks. Since the example's features have things like "0 = Female", perhaps in the code, the categories are represented as strings, so conditions like X['cost of living adjustment'] == 'tc' would work. But in Python, comparing strings directly is okay.

However, in the function, when creating nodes, I have to make sure the comparisons are valid. Let me proceed step by step.

Let me try to build a simple decision tree step by step. Let's start with the first node. Suppose the first split is on 'wage increase first year' being at least 5.0. If yes, go to left subtree; else right.

Then, for the left branch, maybe check the 'duration' being at least 5 years.

Wait, but this is all hypothetical. Since I don't have the actual tree, I have to make assumptions. Let's try to come up with a plausible tree structure.

Alternatively, maybe the first node is the 'wage increase first year' <=5.0. Let's say that if the first year's wage increase is more than 5, that's a good sign. Then, perhaps the next node checks the pension contribution. If pension is 'empl_contr' (employer contributes), that's better. Then maybe check statutory holidays.

Alternatively, another approach: Let me think of some possible splits. For example:

First split: 'duration' <= 4. If the agreement duration is short (<=4 years), maybe it's a bad settlement. But that may not be the case. Alternatively, longer duration might be better.

Alternatively, start with the wage increases. Let's think that the first year wage increase is a key factor. Suppose the first split is on 'wage increase first year' <=5.0. If it is, then maybe check the second year's increase. If not, maybe it's a good settlement.

Alternatively, maybe a higher wage increase in the third year is important. But I need to structure this as a tree.

Alternatively, here's a possible structure:

Node 0: If wage increase first year > 5.5 → go left (good), else go right.

Then, in the left branch (good so far), check if pension is 'empl_contr' (employer contribution). If yes → good (1), else check another condition.

Alternatively, let's try to make a tree with several nodes. Let me try to write a possible path.

Suppose the first split is on 'wage increase first year' > 5.0 → if yes, then perhaps check 'pension' being 'empl_contr'. If that's true, then predict good (1). Else, check something else.

Alternatively, maybe the first node is 'cost of living adjustment' being 'tc' (top category?), then that's a positive indicator.

Wait, but I need to form nodes as per the function structure. Let's try to outline a possible tree:

Let me start with the first node:

Node 0: X['wage increase first year'] > 5.0 → if yes, go left (maybe to node 1), else right (node 2).

Node 1: If X['cost of living adjustment'] == 'tc', then prediction is 1 (good). Else, check another feature.

Wait, but this is getting too vague. Maybe I can make a small tree with 5 nodes as in the example (since in the example there are 5 nodes). Let's see:

Suppose the code has nodes[0] to nodes[4]. Let me think of 5 conditions.

Alternatively, here's an attempt:

nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] > 5.0

nodes[1] = X["duration"] >= 5

nodes[2] = X["cost of living adjustment"] == 'tc'

nodes[3] = X["pension"] == 'empl_contr'

nodes[4] = X["vacation"] == 'gnr'

Then the decision path would be like:

if nodes[0] is True (wage first year >5):

    then check nodes[1] (duration >=5):

        if yes, maybe check nodes[2] (cost of living is tc). If yes, predict 1.

        else, check something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like:

def predict(X: dict):

    nodes = 5 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] > 5.0

    nodes[1] = X["duration"] >= 5

    nodes[2] = X["cost of living adjustment"] == 'tc'

    nodes[3] = X["pension"] == 'empl_contr'

    nodes[4] = X["vacation"] == 'gnr'

    if nodes[0]:

        if nodes[1]:

            if nodes[2]:

                prediction = 1

            else:

                if nodes[3]:

                    prediction = 1

                else:

                    prediction = 0

        else:

            prediction = 0

    else:

        if nodes[4]:

            prediction = 1

        else:

            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

But this is just a guess. However, since the problem statement didn't provide the actual tree, perhaps the user expects me to create a plausible one based on the features and their ranges. But maybe there was a decision tree given in the original problem that the user forgot to include. Since I can't proceed without the tree structure, perhaps I need to make an assumption.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended for me to create a simple tree using some of the features. Let me pick features that can have clear thresholds.

Another approach: Since the target is 0 or 1, perhaps the first split is on a key feature like 'wage increase first year' being above a threshold. Let's pick 5.0 as the threshold.

Then, if that's true, check another feature like 'cost of living adjustment' being 'tc' (the best option). If both are true, then good (1). Else, check another condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on 'duration' being >=5. Suppose a longer contract is better. If duration >=5, then check wage increases.

Alternatively, here's a possible structure:

nodes[0] = X['duration'] >=5 → if yes, proceed to node1, else node2.

Node1: X['wage increase first year'] >5 → if yes, good (1). Else, check pension.

Wait, but this is getting too vague. Since the user's example had 5 nodes, perhaps I can structure a 5-node decision tree.

Alternatively, maybe the first node is on 'wage increase first year' > 5.0 (nodes[0]). If yes, then check if 'cost of living adjustment' is 'tc' (nodes[1]). If both are true, predict good (1). If not, check another condition.

Alternatively, here's a possible code structure with 5 nodes:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5
    # Node 0: wage increase first year > 5.0
    nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] > 5.0
    # Node1: duration >= 5
    nodes[1] = X['duration'] >= 5
    # Node2: cost of living adjustment is 'tc'
    nodes[2] = X['cost of living adjustment'] == 'tc'
    # Node3: pension is 'empl_contr'
    nodes[3] = X['pension'] == 'empl_contr'
    # Node4: vacation is 'gnr'
    nodes[4] = X['vacation'] == 'gnr'

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[3] and nodes[4]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes

But this is arbitrary. Alternatively, maybe the first node is on wage increase first year > 5, then next node on the second year's increase, etc.

Alternatively, another approach: Let's suppose the decision tree is as follows:

The first split is on 'wage increase first year' > 5.0. If yes:

    Then check if 'cost of living adjustment' is 'tc'. If yes → good (1). Else, check if 'pension' is 'empl_contr'. If yes → good, else bad.

If the first condition is no (wage first year <=5):

    Check if duration is >=5. If yes → check if 'cost of living adjustment' is 'tc'. If yes → good. Else, check statutory holidays.

But I need to structure this into code with nodes.

Alternatively, let's try to make a simple tree with 5 nodes.

Here's another attempt:

nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] > 5.0 → node0 is True if >5.

nodes[1] = X['cost of living adjustment'] == 'tc'

nodes[2] = X['pension'] == 'empl_contr'

nodes[3] = X['duration'] >=5

nodes[4] = X['vacation'] == 'gnr'

Then the code:

if nodes[0] is True:

    if nodes[1] is True → predict 1

    else:

        if nodes[2] → predict 1 else 0

else:

    if nodes[3] → check nodes[4], if yes → predict 1 else 0

Wait, but this may require more nodes. Let's structure it step by step.

The code would look something like this:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]*5
    nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] > 5.0
    nodes[1] = X['cost of living adjustment'] == 'tc'
    nodes[2] = X['pension'] == 'empl_contr'
    nodes[3] = X['duration'] >=5
    nodes[4] = X['vacation'] == 'gnr'

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes

This uses all 5 nodes. But this is just an example. Since the problem didn't specify the actual decision tree, I have to make a plausible one.

Alternatively, maybe the first node is on 'wage increase first year' >5, node1 is on 'wage increase second year' >5, node2 on pension, etc.

Alternatively, here's a different structure:

nodes[0]: wage1 >5 → yes → node1: wage2 >5 → yes → predict 1.

Else, node2: pension is empl → yes → predict1, else node3: vacation gnr → yes → predict1.

Alternatively, but this is getting too time-consuming. Since the user's example in the problem had 5 nodes, I'll go with the code above, but maybe adjust.

Alternatively, let's think of nodes as follows:

Node0: wage increase first year >5 → if yes, then node1: duration >=5 → if yes, predict 1 else 0.

Else (node0 no), then node2: cost of living is tc → yes → node3: pension is empl → yes → predict1 else node4: statutory holidays> 20 → etc.

This is getting too convoluted. 

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the first example I wrote, ensuring that all nodes are used and the conditions make sense.

Wait, but in the example given by the user in the problem statement, the function returns the prediction and the nodes array. The nodes are set to True/False based on the conditions. So the code must correctly set each node's value based on the input dictionary X.

Another point: the features like 'cost of living adjustment' have possible values like 'tc', 'mid', 'low'? Or 'tc' is the highest. Similarly for pension: 'empl_contr' is better than others.

Vacation 'gnr' might stand for 'good' or 'generous', so that's a positive.

So the code's logic could be:

If the first year wage is good (>5), then check if the cost of living is best (tc) → good. If not, check pension. If pension is good → good.

Else (first year wage not good):

Check if duration is long (>=5), then check vacation is good → good. Else, no.

This would use 5 nodes.

Thus, the code would be:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] *5
    nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] >5.0
    nodes[1] = X['cost of living adjustment'] == 'tc'
    nodes[2] = X['pension'] == 'empl_contr'
    nodes[3] = X['duration'] >=5
    nodes[4] = X['vacation'] == 'gnr'

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =1
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction =1
            else:
                prediction =0
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction =1
            else:
                prediction =0
        else:
            prediction =0
    return prediction, nodes

This uses all 5 nodes. The nodes are assigned as per the conditions, and the prediction is determined through nested if-else.

This should be a plausible answer. However, since the actual decision tree wasn't provided, this is an example-based solution.
