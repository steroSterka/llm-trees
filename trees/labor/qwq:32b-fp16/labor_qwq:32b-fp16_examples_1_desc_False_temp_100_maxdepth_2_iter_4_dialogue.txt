<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants a decision tree classifier for labor negotiation outcomes (good or bad) with a maximum depth of 2. They provided a list of features, so first I need to understand which features are most important. Since it's a decision tree, the key is to choose the best splits at each node based on some criteria like information gain or Gini impurity. 

First, I need to list out the features again to make sure I have them all:

- duration of agreement (1 to 7)
- wage increase in first year (2 to 7)
- wage increase in second year (2 to 7)
- wage increase in third year (2 to 7)
- cost of living adjustment (categories: none, temporary formula, total adjustment)
- number of working hours (35 to 40)
- employer contributions to pension (none, retirement allowance, employee contribution)
- standby pay (2 to 25)
- shift differential (1 to 25)
- education allowance (yes/no)
- number of statutory holidays (9 to 15)
- paid vacation days (below avg, avg, generous)
- employer's help during disability (yes/no)
- dental plan contribution (none, half, full)
- bereavement contribution (yes/no)
- health plan contribution (none, half, full)

The target variable is the outcome (good/bad). Since the example given used petal width as the first split, maybe the most important feature here is something like wage increases or cost of living adjustments. But I need to think which could best split the data early.

First, the maximum depth is 2. That means the tree can have at most two levels of splits. The root node splits into two branches, each of those can split again, but no further. So we need to pick the top two most important features.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on a categorical feature that has a strong correlation with the outcome. For example, if having a cost of living adjustment (especially the full one) might be a strong indicator of a good outcome. Or perhaps the wage increases in the first year being high.

Alternatively, maybe the number of paid vacation days or the health plan contributions are important. But I need to think of features that can be split into binary or ranges to form the decision nodes.

Since the user's example used numerical features split at a threshold (like petal width <=0.8), but some of these features are categorical. So for categorical features, the split would be based on categories.

Wait, the problem says to build a decision tree with max depth 2 using the "most important features". Since I don't have the actual data, I have to make an educated guess based on typical labor negotiation factors. 

In labor negotiations, key factors that might determine a good outcome could be:

1. Wage increases (especially in the first year). High increases might lead to a good outcome.
2. Cost of living adjustment (COLA) – having a full adjustment could be important.
3. Health and dental plans – full contributions from employer.
4. Paid vacation days being generous.
5. Standby pay and shift differential being reasonable.

Alternatively, maybe the duration of the agreement being longer (like 5+ years) is good. Or the number of working hours being lower (like 35 or 37.5) is better.

But since the features have different scales, I need to think in terms of splits. Let me try to think of the first split. Suppose the first split is on the wage increase in the first year. Let's say if the first year wage increase is above a certain threshold (like 5%), then it's more likely to be a good outcome. Alternatively, if the cost of living adjustment is 'total compensation adjustment' (the best option), that might be a strong indicator.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on whether the employer contributes fully to the health plan. That could be a major factor. Let's assume that.

Alternatively, let's think of the most impactful feature first. Suppose the health plan contribution being full is a strong indicator. So the first split could be:

- If employer's contribution towards health plan is full → good outcome.
- Else, split again.

But the depth is 2, so the next split after that would be on another feature.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on whether the wage increase in the first year is above a certain number. Let's say if first year wage increase is >=5, then good, else split on another feature like the health plan.

Alternatively, perhaps the most critical is the cost of living adjustment. If they have 'total compensation adjustment' (the best option) then good, else split on something else.

Alternatively, maybe the number of paid vacation days: if it's 'generous', that's good, else split on another feature.

Alternatively, the presence of an education allowance (yes/no) could be a split.

Wait, since the user's example used a numerical feature split first, perhaps the first split is a numerical feature. Let's pick the wage increase in the first year. Let's say if first year wage increase >=5, then the outcome is good, else go to another split. The second split could be on the health plan contribution.

Alternatively, the first split might be on the duration of the agreement. If the agreement is longer (like >=5 years), maybe that's a good sign.

Alternatively, let's think of possible splits:

Suppose first split on "wage increase in first year of contract" > some value (like 4.5). Let's say if it's above 4.5, then outcome is good. The other branch would split on another feature, like the health plan contribution.

Alternatively, maybe the cost of living adjustment is a categorical feature. Let's say if the cost of living adjustment is 'total compensation adjustment', then outcome is good. Else, split on the wage increase in the first year.

Alternatively, the first split could be on the health plan contribution. If it's full, then the outcome is good. If not, then split on the wage increase first year.

Alternatively, the number of paid vacation days. If it's 'generous', then good. Else, split on something else.

Hmm. Since the example used a numerical feature first, perhaps it's better to start with a numerical feature here. Let's pick the first year wage increase as the first split. Suppose the threshold is 4.5 (so if the first year wage increase is above that, like 5 or higher, it's considered good). 

Then, for the next splits (max depth 2), we can split on another feature. Let's see:

Root node: wage increase first year > 4.5? 

If yes → class good.

If no → then split on, say, health plan contribution. 

Wait, but the depth is 2, so the root splits into two, each of those can split once more. Wait no, depth 2 means the root is depth 1, then the next splits are depth 2. So the tree can have up to two splits from the root. Wait, actually, the maximum depth is 2, so the tree can have two levels of decision nodes. So the root is depth 1, then each child can split once more (depth 2), but the leaves are at depth 2. Alternatively, maybe depth counts the number of splits. Let me confirm: in decision trees, depth is the number of edges from the root to a leaf. So maximum depth of 2 would allow the root to split into two nodes, each of those can split once more, leading to leaves at depth 2. So the tree would have three levels (root, two children, then each child can have two children). Wait no, if depth is 2, then the deepest leaves are at depth 2. So the structure would be:

Root (depth 1) splits into two children (depth 2). Each of those children can be leaves or split again, but since maximum depth is 2, they can't split further. Therefore, the tree can only have splits at root and then leaves. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me think again:

Maximum depth of 2 means that the longest path from root to leaf has two edges. Therefore, the root is at level 1, splits into children (level 2). Those children can't split further because that would make the depth 3. So the tree can only have one split (root splits into two leaves). Wait, that can't be right. Wait, depth counts the number of edges. So root is depth 0? Or depth 1? Different sources may define it differently. Let me think: 

In some definitions, the root is at depth 0. Then its children are at depth 1. So maximum depth 2 would allow the root to split once (children at depth 1), then each child can split once more (leaves at depth 2). Therefore, the tree would have two splits. So total depth is 2. 

Alternatively, if the root is depth 1, then maximum depth 2 allows two splits. 

Probably, the user's example had a depth of 2 with three levels (root, then two splits). The example given had:

petal width <=0.8 (root)

then for the right branch, another split on petal width <=1.75.

So that's two splits (depth 2). Therefore, the user's example has maximum depth 2, with two layers of splits. So in our case, we need to build a tree with two layers of splits. So the first split (root), then each of those splits can split again once, leading to four leaves at maximum. But since the max depth is 2, those second splits are allowed. 

Therefore, the structure would be:

Root (split 1) → two children (depth 1 nodes). Each of those can split again (split 2), resulting in four leaves (depth 2). 

So the decision tree needs to have two levels of splitting.

Now, choosing the features. Let me try to pick the most important features. Since I don't have data, I have to hypothesize. 

Possible key features:

1. Wage increases (first year is probably most important)
2. Cost of living adjustment (COLA)
3. Health plan contributions (full is better)
4. Paid vacation days (generous)
5. Employer contributions to pension (retirement allowance included or employee contribution is better than none)
6. Standby pay and shift differential (higher is better)
7. Education allowance (yes is better)
8. Duration of agreement (longer is better)
9. Working hours (lower is better, like 35-37.5 vs 40)

Let me consider the first split. Let's start with wage increase first year. Suppose the threshold is 4.5. So:

Root node: wage increase first year > 4.5?

If yes → maybe outcome is good.

If no → then split on another feature, say, health plan contribution.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the health plan contribution. 

Suppose first split is on health plan contribution being full. 

If yes → good outcome.

If no → then split on wage increase first year.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on cost of living adjustment. 

If COLA is 'total compensation adjustment' → good.

Else, split on wage first year.

Alternatively, the first split on paid vacation days being generous.

Hmm. Let me try to make an example tree following these steps.

First, pick the most important feature as the root. Suppose it's the health plan contribution. If the employer contributes fully, that's a strong indicator of good. So first split:

Root: Health plan contribution = full? 

If yes → outcome is good.

If no → then split on another feature, maybe wage increase first year.

Suppose the second split (for the 'no' branch) is on wage increase first year. Let's say if wage increase first year is >5, then outcome is good, else bad.

Wait, but that might be too simplistic. Alternatively, for the 'no' branch (health not full), then the next split could be on COLA. 

Alternatively, let's try to make a tree with two splits:

Root split on wage increase first year: if >4.5 → good. Else, split on health plan contribution. If health is full → good, else bad.

So the tree would look like:

|--- wage increase first year > 4.5 → class: good

|--- wage increase first year <=4.5

||--- health plan contribution = full → class: good

||--- health plan contribution != full → class: bad

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on COLA. Suppose if COLA is total → good, else split on wage.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the duration of agreement. If duration is >4 years (since max is 7, maybe 5+ is better), then good. Else, split on wage or health.

Alternatively, let's see the example given. In the iris example, the first split was on a numerical feature (petal width), which is a key separator between setosa and others. Maybe in labor negotiations, the first split is on the first year wage increase, which is a key factor. Let's proceed with that.

So, let's try:

Root: wage increase first year > 4.5 → good

Else → split on Health plan contribution (full? → good else bad)

Alternatively, the second split could be on the health plan contribution. Let's see:

Decision Tree:

|--- wage increase first year (2 to7) > 4.5

||--- class: good

|--- wage increase first year <=4.5

||--- health plan contribution (none / half / full) = full

|||--- class: good

||--- health plan contribution != full

|||--- class: bad

This would be a depth of 2. 

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on another feature. Suppose after the first split on wage, the next split is on COLA:

|--- wage increase first year >4.5 → good

|--- wage increase first year <=4.5

||--- cost of living adjustment = total compensation adjustment → good

||--- else → bad

That might be better. Because even if first year wage isn't high, if they have a good COLA, it could still be good.

Alternatively, if the first split is on COLA:

|--- COLA = total → good

|--- else

||--- wage increase first year >4.5 → good

||--- else → bad

This also works.

Another possibility is starting with the health plan contribution as root. 

|--- health plan contribution = full → good

|--- else

||--- wage increase first year >5 → good

||--- else → bad

But I think the first year wage is a strong candidate. Alternatively, maybe the combination of first year wage and the COLA. 

Alternatively, another angle: the number of paid vacation days being 'generous' could be a strong indicator. Let me see.

Suppose first split is paid vacation days = generous → then maybe good outcome. Else split on wage.

But I'm not sure. Since the user's example used a numerical split, maybe starting with a numerical feature is better. Let's go with the first idea.

But I need to ensure that the features used are among the given ones. Let me check the features again:

wage increase in first year of contract (2 to 7) → numerical.

cost of living adjustment (categories)

health plan contribution (none, half, full)

So the first split could be on wage first year >4.5, then for the <=4.5 group, split on health plan contribution being full. 

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on the cost of living adjustment. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the cost of living adjustment. Let's say if COLA is 'total', then good. Else, split on wage first year.

This might also be good. Let me think of possible splits.

Alternatively, perhaps the most important factor is the combination of wage increases and health benefits. 

Alternatively, let's think of the most common factors in labor negotiations: wages are critical, so starting with wage first year makes sense.

So, I'll proceed with the first approach:

Root split on first year wage increase. Suppose the threshold is 4.5 (since the range is 2-7, so 4.5 is midpoint). 

Then, for those with <=4.5, the next split would be on the health plan contribution. If health is full, then good; else, bad.

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on the cost of living adjustment being 'total' → then good, else bad.

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on the third year wage increase, but that might be less important.

Alternatively, let's see another approach. The user's example had the first split on petal width, which is a key differentiator between classes. So maybe here, the most important feature is the wage increase first year, which differentiates good from bad. 

Another possibility is the employer's contribution to the health plan. Suppose that's a key differentiator. So first split on health plan contribution being full. If yes → good, else split on wage first year.

Alternatively, the first split could be whether the employer contributes fully to both health and dental plans. But since those are separate features, that's not possible. 

Alternatively, the presence of an education allowance (yes/no) might be a factor, but it's a binary feature.

Alternatively, the working hours: lower is better, so if working hours are below 40 (assuming 40 is the max?), but the feature is 'working hours (35-40?)', so if it's 35-37.5 vs 40.

But since I don't have the exact data, I have to make assumptions.

Given that, I think the first split on first year wage increase is a good start. Let's go with that.

Therefore, the decision tree would be:

|--- wage increase first year (2 to7) > 4.5 → class: good

|--- wage increase first year <=4.5

||--- health plan contribution = full → class: good

||--- else → class: bad

Alternatively, if the second split is on COLA:

|--- wage increase first year >4.5 → good

|--- else

||--- cost of living adjustment = total → good

||--- else → bad

Either way is possible. Since the user might prefer a numerical and categorical split.

Alternatively, the first split could be on a categorical feature. Let me think again.

Suppose the first split is on the cost of living adjustment:

Root: cost of living adjustment = total compensation adjustment → good

Else → split on wage first year >4.5 → if yes then good, else bad.

This also works.

But to choose between these, perhaps the first year wage is more critical. 

Alternatively, combining both. 

Alternatively, maybe the most important is the combination of high wage and good benefits.

Alternatively, let's see. The user's example for iris used a numerical split first, so following that pattern, starting with a numerical feature is better.

Therefore, I will go with the first approach.

Another check: the user's example had three classes, so they needed two splits. Here, we have two classes (good/bad?), but the user didn't specify the classes. Assuming the problem is to classify into good or bad labor offer, the tree needs to split into two classes.

But the exact classes are not specified. Assuming that the classes are "good offer" and "bad offer", the decision tree would need to split based on key factors.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to predict a certain outcome like "employee accepts" or "rejects", but since it's unclear, I'll proceed with the structure based on the features.

Alternatively, perhaps the most important features are first year wage and health plan. Therefore, the tree as above.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the health plan contribution being full, then for those who are not, split on wage.

Let me try:

|--- health plan contribution = full → good

|--- else

||--- wage increase first year >5 → good

||--- else → bad

This might also be good.

Since I have to choose one, perhaps this is better because even if the wage isn't high, full health coverage can still make it a good offer.

Alternatively, the user might prefer the first approach where the first split is on wage.

Since I need to make a choice, I'll present both possibilities and choose one.

Alternatively, let's think of the features that have more impact. Suppose that first year wage is the most important, followed by health coverage. So the first split is on wage, then health.

Therefore, the tree would be:

|--- wage increase first year >4.5 → good

|--- wage increase first year <=4.5

||--- health plan contribution = full → good

||--- else → bad

This way, even if the wage is moderate, if health is full, it's good.

Alternatively, let's see another angle. The feature 'duration of agreement' might be important. Suppose a longer duration (e.g., >4 years) is better. So:

Root split on duration >4 → good, else split on wage.

But since I have to pick two features, perhaps the first two are wage and health.

Alternatively, considering that in the iris example, the first split separated setosa from others, which is a clear separation. Here, maybe the first split on first year wage could separate the 'good' offers from 'bad' based on that.

Alternatively, if the first year wage is above a certain threshold, it's good, else check health.

Alternatively, let's pick the first approach.

Therefore, the decision tree would look like:

|--- wage increase first year (2 to7) >4.5 → class: Good

|--- wage increase first year ≤4.5

||--- health plan contribution (none, half, full) = full → class: Good

||--- health plan contribution (none or half) → class: Bad

This would form a depth-2 tree.

Alternatively, using COLA instead of health:

|--- wage increase first year >4.5 → Good

|--- wage increase first year ≤4.5

||--- cost of living adjustment = total → Good

||--- else → Bad

Alternatively, combining both, but with two splits, it's okay.

Since the user's example used petal width first, maybe following that pattern with a numerical feature first is better.

Thus, I'll present the tree with wage first, then health.

But I should also consider other features. For instance, if the employer offers a retirement plan (pension contribution), that could be a factor. The feature 'employer contributions to pension' has categories: none, retirement allowance included, or employee contribution. So if it's 'retirement allowance included' that's better than 'employee contribution' or none.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of education allowance (yes/no) is a factor.

But without more info, I'll proceed with the first two features.

Therefore, the final answer would be structured as follows.



#########################


<think>

Okay, I need to create a Python function that mimics a decision tree based on the provided features and their descriptions. The function should return a prediction and a list indicating which nodes were triggered. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, the features and their details are given. The target is whether a labor negotiation settlement is good (1) or bad (0). The features include things like wage increases over three years, working hours, pension contributions, etc. Each feature has its own range or possible values.

The user provided an example of a decision tree function for a diabetes prediction. They used HbA1c and blood glucose levels with thresholds, so I need to do something similar but with the labor negotiation features.

The main challenge is choosing which features to split on and what thresholds to use. Since the user mentioned placeholders for thresholds should be filled with meaningful values, I need to pick thresholds that make sense based on the feature descriptions.

Let me list out the features again to see which might be important. The target is the settlement outcome. Features like wage increases, working hours, pension, and contributions to health plans could influence the outcome. For example, higher wage increases might lead to a better settlement, but maybe only if other factors like working hours aren't too high.

Let me think of possible splits. Starting with the root node, maybe the 'duration' of the agreement? If the duration is longer, perhaps the settlement is better. The duration ranges from 1 to 7 years. Maybe split at 5 years. So if duration > 5, that's a certain path.

Alternatively, the wage increases. Let's say the first year wage increase. If it's above a certain value, like 5%, maybe that's a good sign. Or maybe the total of the three years?

Wait, the example uses binary splits (<= or >). Let me try to structure a simple decision tree. Let's start with the first split on the total wage increases over three years. Wait, but the features are separate for each year. Alternatively, maybe the third year's wage increase is important. Or perhaps the 'cost of living adjustment' which has categories (none, tcf, tc). Hmm, categorical variables might need to be handled differently, but the example used thresholds on numerical features, so maybe I'll focus on numerical ones first.

Looking at the target variable's description, it's a binary outcome. Let's think of a simple tree. Let's try:

Root node: duration. Suppose if duration is greater than 4, then maybe proceed to check another feature. Let's say threshold at 4.5.

Then, the next split could be on the 'wage increase first year' being above a certain value, say 5.0. 

Wait, maybe the first split should be on a more critical factor like the total wage increases. Alternatively, the example uses HbA1c and blood glucose, so maybe pick two features for splits. Let me try to think of a plausible path.

Suppose the root is 'wage increase first year' <= 5. If yes, then maybe check another feature like 'working hours' (since long working hours could be a negative). For example, if working hours are above 38, that might be bad. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on 'cost of living adjustment' being 'tc' (the highest level?), but since it's categorical, maybe need to code it as a threshold. Wait, the feature 'cost of living adjustment' has possible values: none, tcf, tc. How to handle that? Maybe check if it's 'tc' (assuming that's better). Since the example uses numerical features, perhaps I can map the categories to numbers. For instance, none=0, tcf=1, tc=2. Then a threshold at 1.5 would split between none/tcf vs tc. But the user's example didn't do that, but maybe I can proceed.

Alternatively, maybe pick a numerical feature first. Let's start with the 'wage increase third year'. Suppose higher third-year increases are better. So if third year is >5, then maybe that's a good sign. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the total of the three years' increases. But since each is a separate feature, maybe sum them? Not sure if the decision tree can do that, but perhaps the splits are on individual features.

Alternatively, working hours: if the working hours are over 39, that's a problem, so split there. 

Hmm. Let me try to design a simple tree with two splits (depth 2), similar to the example. Let's say:

Root node: wage increase first year <=5.0. If yes, then check another condition, say the working hours <=39. If both are true, predict 0 (bad?), but maybe need to think differently.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the 'duration' of the agreement. Let's set the threshold at 5. So if duration >5, it's a better settlement. Let's see.

Suppose:

Root node: duration >5 → if yes, then maybe look at another feature like 'cost of living adjustment' being 'tc' (since that's a good adjustment). But since it's categorical, maybe code as a numerical value. Wait, in the features, the 'cost of living adjustment' has options none, tcf, tc. Let's map them to 0,1,2. So if the value is >=1 (either tcf or tc), that's better. So split at 1.5 would mean if it's >=2 (tc), but perhaps that's too specific. Alternatively, split at 0.5: if >0.5 means it's at least tcf. Hmm, maybe that's a way to handle it.

Alternatively, maybe go with a numerical feature for the second split. Like 'standby pay' being above a certain amount. Let me think of an example decision path.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on 'vacation' which has categories 'ba', 'avg', 'gnr'. Let's say 'gnr' is the best (maybe higher vacation days). But how to encode that? Maybe map 'ba'=0, 'avg'=1, 'gnr'=2. So a threshold of 1.5 would mean if it's 'gnr' then yes. But again, the example uses numerical features, so perhaps better to stick with numerical ones first.

Alternatively, let's think of the example given in the problem's example. They split on HbA1c and blood glucose. So in our case, perhaps split on 'wage increase first year' and 'working hours'.

Let me try this structure:

Root node: wage increase first year <=5.0 → if yes, then check another feature like 'working hours' <=38. 

If both are true (wage first year <=5 and working hours <=38), then maybe the settlement is bad (0), else good (1). Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think of plausible scenarios.

Suppose a contract offers a low first year increase (<=5), but if the working hours are high (over 38), that's bad. So combining those might lead to a bad outcome. Alternatively, maybe it's the opposite. 

Alternatively, maybe if the first year wage is above 5, that's a good sign. Let's try:

Root node: wage increase first year >5 → if yes, then check another feature, like the 'cost of living adjustment' being 'tc' (since that's a good adjustment). 

Wait, but again handling the categorical. Let me think of another approach.

Alternatively, let's start with 'duration' as the first split. Suppose if the duration is longer (over 4 years), then it's a better deal. 

So first split: duration >4 → if yes, then maybe check another feature like 'contribution to health plan' being 'full'. 

The contribution has options: none, half, full. So if it's full, that's good. So maybe mapping to 0,1,2, so threshold at 1.5 would mean if it's full (2). 

So the nodes would be:

nodes[0] = X['duration'] >4 → if true, proceed to next node.

Then, nodes[1] = X['contribution to health plan'] >=2 (since full is 2). 

If both are true, then predict 1 (good). But I need to structure the if-else correctly.

Alternatively, the structure could be:

If duration >4:

   if contribution to health is 'full' (>=2), then good (1).

   else, maybe check another condition?

Wait, perhaps need to make it a depth 2 tree. Let me think of code structure similar to the example.

Alternatively, maybe the root is on 'wage increase third year' >5. Then, if yes, check if 'longterm disability assistance' is true (which is 1, since it's encoded as true/false). 

Hmm, but the example uses numerical features. Let me try to construct the code step by step.

Suppose we have two splits (depth 2), so the nodes list has two entries. Let's pick two features for the splits.

First split: wage increase first year <=5 → node[0]

Second split (if first is true): working hours <=38 → node[1]

Then, the prediction would depend on those two. For instance:

If first node (wage first year <=5) is true, and second (working hours <=38) is true → prediction 0 (bad)

Else, maybe 1. But the exact logic depends on what makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on 'vacation' being 'gnr' (high vacation). Suppose:

node[0] = X['vacation'] == 'gnr' → but in code, need to handle as numerical. Since in the features, vacation is 'ba', 'avg', 'gnr', maybe mapped to 0,1,2. So node[0] = X['vacation'] >1 → since 'gnr' is 2.

Wait, but in the features list, 'vacation' is given as [ba, avg, gnr], so perhaps the mapping is ba (0), avg (1), gnr (2). So if it's gnr, the value is 2. So to check if it's gnr, we can do X['vacation'] >=2?

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on 'longterm disability assistance' being true (so 1). If that's true, then maybe check another feature like 'contribution to dental plan' being 'full'.

But again, need to code that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use two numerical features for simplicity. Let's pick 'wage increase first year' and 'working hours'.

Let me try this approach:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0,0]
    # First split: wage increase first year <=5
    nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] <= 5.0
    # Second split: working hours >38
    nodes[1] = X['working hours'] > 38.0

    if nodes[0]:
        # wage first year is low (<=5)
        if nodes[1]:
            # working hours are high (>38)
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:
            # working hours <=38
            prediction = 1  # good? Maybe depends, but perhaps lower wage but better hours could be okay?
    else:
        # wage first year >5, which is better, so maybe good regardless of hours?
        prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but maybe the logic here is that if the first year wage is low, but the working hours are high, that's a bad deal. If the wage is low but hours are okay, maybe it's still okay (so prediction 1?), or maybe not. Alternatively, maybe if the first year is high, it's better.

Alternatively, perhaps the first node is wage first year >5. Let's try that:

nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] >5.0

If that's true, then maybe check another feature, like the second year wage.

Alternatively, let me think of another scenario. Suppose the first split is on 'contribution to health plan' being 'full' (so >=2). 

nodes[0] = X['contribution to health plan'] >=2

If that's true, then maybe check 'duration' >4.

Wait, but how do I code the categorical variables? The user's example used numerical features, so maybe I need to choose features that are numerical.

Alternatively, the 'cost of living adjustment' is a categorical variable with 'none', 'tcf', 'tc'. If I map them to 0,1,2, then I can use a threshold. For example, if 'tc' (2) is the best, so if the value is >=2, then it's good.

So maybe:

First split: cost of living adjustment is 'tc' → nodes[0] = X['cost of living adjustment'] >=2 (assuming 'tc' is 2).

Then, second split could be on wage increase third year >5.

Hmm, but this is getting a bit complicated. Let me see the example again. The example has two nodes and a depth of 2. So the function has two nodes. The first is a condition, the second is a condition under the first.

So I need to choose two features, with thresholds, and structure the if-else accordingly.

Perhaps the best approach is to pick two features that are likely to impact the settlement. For example:

1. The total wage increases over three years. But since each is separate, maybe check the third year's wage increase. Suppose a higher third-year increase is good. Let's say third year >5.

But the first split could be on 'wage increase third year' >5. 

Second split could be on 'working hours' <= 38.

Alternatively, let's try:

First split: wage increase second year >5 → node[0]

Second split (if node[0] is true): contribution to health plan is full (>=2) → node[1]

Then, if both are true → good (1), else bad (0). But this is just a hypothesis.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to make up a plausible condition:

Suppose that if the first year wage increase is above average (say 5%), and the working hours are reasonable (<=38), then the settlement is good.

So:

node[0] = X['wage increase first year'] >5.0

node[1] = X['working hours'] <=38.0

Then:

if node[0] is True:

    if node[1] is True → good (1)

    else → maybe still okay (1?) or bad?

Wait, maybe if wage is high but hours are long, it's still good because the wage compensates? Or maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the prediction is 1 only if both are true.

Alternatively, the code could be:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [False, False]
    # First check if wage first year >5
    nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] >5.0
    # If first is true, check working hours <=38
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X['working hours'] <=38.0
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        # If first is false (wage <=5), check another condition?
        # Since depth is 2, maybe just set prediction to 0 here?
        # Or perhaps another node, but in the example they have two nodes for two conditions.
        # So maybe the second node is only checked if first is true, else the prediction is based on first.
        # So in the else case (nodes[0] is False), then maybe prediction is 0.
        prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but in the example given in the problem, the function has two nodes, and the second condition is only checked if the first is true. So the structure is similar. 

So in this setup, if the first condition is met (wage first year >5), then we check the second condition (working hours <=38). If both are true, then 1, else 0. If first is not met (wage <=5), then prediction is 0.

This would give a plausible model where a higher first year wage and reasonable hours lead to a good settlement, otherwise bad.

Alternatively, maybe the second condition is the opposite, such as if the first is true, but the second is false (hours are high), then it's still okay. But according to the code above, it would be 0.

Alternatively, maybe the second condition is if hours are high, then bad. So that's captured.

Alternatively, maybe the first node is on working hours, but let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on 'duration' (longer contracts are better). So:

node[0] = X['duration'] >4 (assuming duration is in years, for example)

Then, if the duration is long, check if contribution to health is full (node[1]).

Thus:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0,0]
    nodes[0] = X['duration'] >4
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X['contribution to health plan'] >=2  # assuming 'full' is 2
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =1
        else:
            prediction=0
    else:
        prediction=0
    return prediction, nodes

This would mean that only contracts with duration over 4 years and full health contribution are good, else bad.

This is plausible, but requires handling categorical variables as numbers. The user's problem mentions that the features might be categorical, but in the example given in the problem statement (the example with HbA1c), the features are numerical. The user hasn't specified how to handle categorical variables, so perhaps we should stick to numerical features for simplicity.

Alternatively, use the 'vacation' feature which is categorical but can be mapped to numbers.

Alternatively, maybe 'standby pay' is a numerical feature. Let's say if the standby pay is above a certain amount, say 100, then it's good.

Alternatively, maybe 'longterm disability assistance' is a binary (0/1) feature. So:

node[0] = X['longterm disability assistance'] ==1

if that's true, then check another feature like 'contribution to dental plan' is 'full' (>=2).

Thus:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [False, False]
    nodes[0] = X['longterm disability assistance'] ==1
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X['contribution to dental plan'] >=2
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =1
        else:
            prediction=0
    else:
        prediction=0
    return prediction, nodes

This way, only contracts with disability assistance and full dental get a good score.

But the problem is that the user expects the code to use the features provided, and perhaps the exact feature names. Since in the features list, there are both categorical and numerical features, but to make it simple, let's choose two numerical features.

Let me pick 'wage increase first year' and 'working hours' as before.

Thus, the code would be as I wrote earlier:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [False, False]
    nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] >5.0
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X['working hours'] <=38.0
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =1
        else:
            prediction =0
    else:
        prediction =0
    return prediction, nodes

This is a simple decision tree with two nodes. The first node checks if the first year wage increase is above 5. If yes, then it checks if the working hours are <=38. If both are true, then good (1), else 0. If the first is false, then it's automatically 0.

Alternatively, maybe the prediction should be 1 in some other cases, but this is a possible structure.

Alternatively, to make it different, suppose:

node[0] = X['wage increase third year'] >5.0

node[1] = X['contribution to health plan'] >=2 (full)

Then:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [False, False]
    nodes[0] = X['wage increase third year'] >5.0
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X['contribution to health plan'] >=2
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =1
        else:
            prediction=0
    else:
        prediction=0
    return prediction, nodes

This way, only if the third year wage is good and health is full, it's good.

Alternatively, maybe the first node is on 'duration' and the second on 'vacation' mapped to numbers.

But perhaps the first approach with wage and working hours is better since they are numerical.

Alternatively, another possibility is using 'standby pay' and 'gnr' vacation.

Assuming 'vacation' is mapped to 0,1,2 for 'ba', 'avg', 'gnr'.

node[0] = X['vacation'] >=2 (i.e., 'gnr')

Then, node[1] = X['standby pay'] > 100 (some value)

But without knowing exact values, it's a bit arbitrary.

Alternatively, perhaps the example should be as simple as possible, using two numerical features with clear thresholds.

Thus, I think the first approach with wage first year and working hours is plausible.

Thus, the code would be:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0,0]
    # First node: wage increase first year >5
    nodes[0] = 1 if X['wage increase first year'] > 5.0 else 0
    # Second node: working hours <=38
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = 1 if X['working hours'] <= 38.0 else 0
    else:
        nodes[1] = 0  # since second node is only checked if first is true
    
    if nodes[0] and nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1
    elif nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0
    else:
        prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but in the initial code structure, the nodes should just be booleans or 0/1, but in the problem's example, they probably expect a list of booleans or 0/1. Also, in the example, the nodes are just conditions stored as booleans.

Wait looking back at the example given in the problem:

In the example, the function returns a prediction and the nodes, which are the results of the conditions. The example's code has:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [False, False]
    # First condition
    nodes[0] = X['HbA1c'] <= 6.5
    if nodes[0]:
        # Second condition only if first is true
        nodes[1] = X['blood_pressure'] <= 130
        if nodes[1]:
            return 0, nodes
        else:
            return 1, nodes
    else:
        return 1, nodes

So the nodes are stored as booleans, and the second node is only evaluated if the first is true. The nodes array is of length two, with each indicating whether the condition was met (True/False).

Following this structure, the code should be:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [False, False]
    # First condition: wage increase first year >5
    nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] > 5.0
    if nodes[0]:
        # Second condition: working hours <=38
        nodes[1] = X['working hours'] <= 38.0
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # good
        else:
            prediction = 0  # bad
    else:
        prediction = 0  # bad
    return prediction, nodes

This fits the structure from the example, with two nodes, each indicating if their respective condition was met. The second node is only evaluated if the first is true, and the nodes array is returned with the results.

Therefore, this seems like a correct approach using two numerical features with clear thresholds.
