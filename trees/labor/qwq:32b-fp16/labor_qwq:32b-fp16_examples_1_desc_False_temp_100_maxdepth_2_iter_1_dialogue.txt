<think>

Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants me to induce a decision tree classifier for labor negotiations outcomes (good or bad) using the given features, with a maximum depth of 2. 

First, I need to recall how decision trees work. The main idea is to select the best feature at each node to split the data, aiming to maximize some measure of purity, like information gain or Gini impurity. Since the maximum depth is 2, the tree can have at most two splits after the root.

The features provided are a mix of numerical and categorical variables. For numerical features, splits are typically based on thresholds (e.g., <= X or > X), while categorical features can be split based on their categories. 

Let's list out the features again to make sure I have them all:

1. Duration of agreement (1 to 7)
2. Wage increase in first year (2 to 7)
3. Wage increase in second year (2 to 7)
4. Wage increase in third year (2 to 7)
5. Cost of living adjustment (none, temporary, total)
6. Number of working hours (35 to 40)
7. Employer contributions to pension plan (none, retirement allowance, employee contribution)
8. Standby pay (2 to 25)
9. Shift differential (1 to 25)
10. Education allowance (yes/no)
11. Number of statutory holidays (9 to 15)
12. Number of paid vacation days (below average, average, generous)
13. Employer's help during disability (yes/no)
14. Dental plan contribution (none, half, full)
15. Bereavement contribution (yes/no)
16. Health plan contribution (none, half, full)

Wait, the user listed 16 features here. Let me count again. The original list after "Features:" has:

- duration of agreement (1 to 7)
- wage increase first year (2 to 7)
- wage increase second year (2 to 7)
- wage increase third year (2 to 7)
- cost of living adjustment (none / temporary / total)
- number of working hours (35-40)
- employer contributions to pension plan (none / retirement allowance / employee contribution)
- standby pay (2-25)
- shift differential (1-25)
- education allowance (yes/no)
- number of statutory holidays (9-15)
- number of paid vacation days (below average / average / generous)
- employer's help during disability (yes/no)
- employer's contribution to dental (none / half / full)
- bereavement contribution (yes/no)
- employer's contribution to health (none / half / full)

Yes, that's 16 features. 

Now, since the tree has a maximum depth of 2, the root node will split on the most important feature, then each of its children can split again on another feature, but not deeper than that. Alternatively, if the maximum depth is 2, it means that the tree can have at most two levels of splits: root, then two splits from there. Wait, actually, depth is counted as the number of edges from the root to the farthest leaf. So maximum depth of 2 means the tree can have two splits (root is depth 0, then split to depth 1, then split again to depth 2). But maybe the user means that the tree can have a maximum of two levels of nodes. Hmm, the example given had depth 2 (since the longest path from root to leaf is two splits). So in this case, the tree can have up to two splits. 

First, I need to figure out which features are the most important. Since I don't have the actual data, I need to make assumptions based on common sense about labor negotiations. 

Typically, in labor negotiations, key factors might include wage increases, cost of living adjustments, health benefits, and working hours. For example, higher wage increases, better cost of living adjustments, better health benefits, and fewer working hours might lead to a "good" outcome. Conversely, lower wage increases, no COLA, poor benefits, etc., might lead to "bad".

But since I don't have the actual data distribution, I have to hypothesize based on typical importance. Let's consider possible splits:

Starting with the root node. Which feature would split the data best? Maybe something like the health plan contribution because it's a critical benefit. If an employer contributes fully to the health plan, that might be a strong indicator of a good outcome. Alternatively, the wage increases, especially in the first year, might be a key factor. 

Alternatively, the cost of living adjustment: if they have a total adjustment, that's better than none. 

Another angle: the number of paid vacation days. If it's generous, that's good, but maybe that's less critical than health or wages.

Alternatively, the duration of the agreement: a longer duration (like 7 years) might be seen as a positive sign of stability, but that's not obvious. 

Alternatively, the employer contributions to the pension plan: if they offer a retirement allowance or employee contribution, that's better than none.

Hmm, tricky without data. Since this is an exercise, maybe the user expects choosing features that are more likely to have a clear split. Let's think of the example given with the iris dataset, where petal width was the most important feature. In that case, the splits were on numerical values. 

In the labor features, perhaps the "employer's contribution towards the health plan" is a key feature. Let's suppose that if the employer contributes fully to the health plan, that's a major factor for a good outcome. 

Alternatively, the wage increase in the first year. Suppose that if the first year wage increase is above a certain threshold (like 5%), it's a good outcome. 

Alternatively, the cost of living adjustment: if it's "total compensation adjustment", that's better than none, so maybe splitting on that.

Another thought: since the tree has to be depth 2, after choosing the first split, the next splits should be on the most important features within each branch.

Alternatively, the education allowance: if it's "yes", that might contribute to a good outcome.

Alternatively, the number of paid vacation days being "generous" instead of below average or average.

Alternatively, the employer's help during disability: if yes, that's good.

Hmm. Let's think of the features that can split the data into two classes (good/bad) most effectively. Since the example used a numerical feature (petal width) split, maybe a numerical feature here is better as the root.

Looking at numerical features:

- duration of agreement (1-7)
- wage increases (first, second, third year: 2-7)
- standby pay (2-25)
- shift differential (1-25)
- number of working hours (35-40)
- number of statutory holidays (9-15)
- paid vacation days (categorical, but could have numerical equivalents, but it's given as categories)

So possible numerical splits: duration, wage increases, standby pay, shift differential, working hours, statutory holidays.

Categorical variables like cost of living adjustment, pension contributions, etc., can also be split but require considering categories.

Suppose I start with the first year wage increase. Let's say the split is at a certain threshold. Maybe if the first year wage increase is above 4, it's considered better. Then, that split might separate the data into two groups.

Alternatively, the health plan contribution. Let's see: if the contribution is "full", that's a good sign, so the root could split on that. But that's a categorical variable with three options (none, half, full). So splitting on "full" vs others might be a way.

Alternatively, the shift differential: if the supplement is high, that could be a positive factor. But not sure.

Alternatively, the number of paid vacation days. Since it's categorical, maybe "generous" vs the others.

Alternatively, maybe the cost of living adjustment. If it's "total", that's better than "temporary" or "none".

But since the example used a numerical split, maybe the user expects using a numerical feature here as the root.

Alternatively, the duration of agreement: longer duration might be better. Suppose splitting at 5 years (so if duration >5, maybe that's good).

Alternatively, the standby pay: if it's over a certain amount, like 15, that's better.

Hmm. Another approach: think of the most impactful feature. In labor negotiations, health care benefits are often critical. So the health plan contribution (none, half, full) might be a key feature. Let's say the root node is "employer's contribution towards the health plan". The split could be between "full" vs "half or none". If the contribution is full, that might lead to a good outcome, while half or none might go to another node.

Then, the next level splits would be on another feature. Since depth is 2, each child of the root can split once more.

Alternatively, let's take the wage increases. Suppose first, the root is the first year wage increase. Let's say if it's above 4.5 (split at 4.5), then that's considered good. Then, for those above, maybe another feature like the health plan, and for those below, maybe the cost of living adjustment.

Alternatively, maybe the root is "employer's contribution towards the health plan", split into "full" and others. Then, for the "full" branch, perhaps the next split is on the first year wage increase (e.g., above 4 vs below). For the non-full branch, maybe the cost of living adjustment (total vs others).

Alternatively, let's think of the example again. The iris example used a single numerical feature for the first split, then another for the next. So maybe here, the first split is on a numerical feature, then another numerical or categorical.

Alternatively, the first split could be on the third year wage increase. But without data, it's hard to say. Alternatively, the number of paid vacation days. Since that's a categorical, but maybe split into "generous" vs others.

Alternatively, let's try to pick the root as the "employer's contribution towards the health plan" (categorical: none, half, full). The split would be between "full" and the rest. Let's suppose that if the contribution is full, the outcome is likely good. So:

Root: employer's contribution towards health plan
   If full → class: good
   If not full → then another split. 

The next split could be on another important feature. Since the max depth is 2, the second split can only happen once on each branch. Wait, the second level nodes can each have their own splits. Wait, the tree structure would be:

Root (health plan)
   Left branch (full): leaf (class: good)
   Right branch (not full) → split on another feature, say "cost of living adjustment". For example, if cost of living is total → good, else → bad.

But that would make the depth 2. 

Alternatively, maybe the right branch splits on wage increase first year. 

Alternatively, maybe the root is "first year wage increase" split at 4.5. Suppose:

Root: first year wage increase <=4.5 → then maybe check another feature like health plan.
   If first year <=4.5 → then split on health plan (full or not). 
   If first year >4.5 → maybe split on another feature like cost of living.

Alternatively, let's try to go step by step.

First, choose the root feature. Suppose I pick "employer's contribution towards the health plan" as root. Split it into "full" and "not full".

- If full → majority of instances here are "good" → so class would be good.

- If not full (half or none), then next split on another feature, say "cost of living adjustment".

Then, for the "not full" branch:

Split on cost of living adjustment: if it's "total", then maybe that's a good outcome, else (none or temporary) → bad.

So the tree would be:

Root: health plan contribution
   |--- Full → class: good
   |--- Not Full
       |--- Cost of living adjustment = Total → class: good
       |--- Cost of living adjustment ≠ Total → class: bad

This is depth 2. But does that make sense? Maybe. Alternatively, perhaps the second split is on the first year wage increase.

Alternatively, maybe "number of paid vacation days" as the root. Split into "generous" vs others. 

But maybe numerical features are better for splits. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the root could be "first year wage increase". Suppose the split is at 4.5. 

If first year wage increase >4.5 → likely good. Then, for those above, maybe check another feature like the health plan. 

Wait, but depth 2 means after splitting at the root, each branch can split once more. So for the first split (root):

First split on first year wage increase (split at 4.5):

Left branch (<=4.5): need another split here. Maybe on health plan contribution.

Right branch (>4.5): maybe another split, like on the second year wage increase.

Alternatively, maybe the right branch (high first year wage) is mostly good, so that's a leaf, but the problem requires max depth 2, so even if the right branch could be a leaf, the left needs to be split again.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe the user expects a more straightforward approach.

Alternatively, let's think of the example again. The iris example used a single numerical feature for the first split, then another numerical feature for the next splits. 

In the labor case, perhaps the first split is on the "employer's contribution towards the health plan". Since it's categorical with three levels, splitting into "full" and the rest (half/none) makes sense. Then, for the non-full group, split on another feature, maybe the "cost of living adjustment".

Alternatively, for the non-full health contribution group, split on whether they have a "generous" paid vacation days. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the "number of paid vacation days". Let's say split between "generous" and others. 

But I think the health plan is more critical. Let me try to outline the tree step by step.

Assuming root is "employer's contribution towards the health plan" (categories: none, half, full). Split into "full" and "not full".

- If full → outcome is good (since full health coverage is a big plus).

- If not full (half or none), then the next split could be on "cost of living adjustment". 

Split cost of living into "total" (meaning they adjust for total compensation) vs others (none or temporary). 

- If cost of living is total → outcome is good.

- Else → outcome is bad.

This gives a depth of 2. Each path from root to leaf has two splits. 

Alternatively, maybe the second split for the non-full health group is on the first year wage increase. For example, if first year wage is high enough, then it's still good, else bad.

Alternatively, the second split could be on the number of paid vacation days being generous. 

Alternatively, another approach: the root is "first year wage increase (2-7)", split at 5. 

- If first year wage increase >5 → then check if health plan is full → good, else maybe another feature.

Wait, but with depth 2, after the first split (root), each branch can split once. 

Suppose root is first year wage increase. Split at 4.5.

Left branch (<=4.5): then split on health plan.

Right branch (>4.5): split on another feature, say cost of living.

In the left branch (low first year wage):

- If health plan is full → good

- Else → bad

In the right branch (high first year wage):

- If cost of living is total → good

- Else → maybe still good? Or bad?

Alternatively, this might not be the best. 

Alternatively, maybe the root is "employer's contribution towards the dental plan" (but dental might be less critical than health). 

Alternatively, the root could be "employer's help during disability" (yes/no). If yes, then good outcome, but maybe that's too simplistic.

Alternatively, maybe the key features are health plan and wage increases. Let's see.

Alternatively, since I need to make a decision without data, I'll proceed with the health plan as root, then cost of living for the non-full group.

Thus the tree would be:

Root: employer's contribution towards the health plan
   |--- full → class: good
   |--- not full (half or none)
       |--- cost of living adjustment = total → class: good
       |--- cost of living adjustment ≠ total → class: bad

This is depth 2, uses two features, and the splits are logical based on typical importance.

Alternatively, maybe for the non-full health contribution group, the next split is on the wage increases. For example, if first year wage is above a certain threshold, then good.

Suppose:

Root: health plan contribution
   |--- full → good
   |--- not full
       |--- first year wage increase > 4 → good
       |--- else → bad

This also works. 

Alternatively, since the problem says "max depth 2", both approaches are valid. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the "number of paid vacation days" as a categorical. 

Root: paid vacation days
   |--- generous → good
   |--- others
       |--- health plan is full → good
       |--- else → bad

But this also uses depth 2. 

Alternatively, to use numerical features like the example, maybe the first split is on "first year wage increase" at 4.5. 

Root: first year wage increase ≤4.5 → split into two branches. 

Left branch (<=4.5):

   Split on health plan contribution → if full → good; else → bad

Right branch (>4.5):

   Split on cost of living adjustment → if total → good; else → maybe still good, but perhaps bad?

Alternatively, for higher wage increases, even with lower health, maybe it's still good. 

But without data, it's hard. 

Alternatively, the problem might expect a numerical split first. Let's try that.

First split on "first year wage increase" at 5. 

Root: first year wage increase >5 → then check health plan.

Left branch (<=5):

   Split on health plan contribution → if full → good else bad

Right branch (>5):

   Split on cost of living adjustment → if total → good else → good? Or maybe split again. 

But in this case, perhaps the right branch (high wage) would be considered good regardless, so maybe that's a leaf. 

But since max depth is 2, the left branch must split again. 

Alternatively, the right branch splits on another feature like "number of paid vacation days".

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe the first approach with health plan as root is better, leading to a clear decision.

Alternatively, let me think of another angle. The example used a single numerical feature for the first split, then another numerical. Maybe here, the first split is on "first year wage increase" (numeric), then "third year wage increase".

But perhaps the user wants a different approach.

Alternatively, the root could be "cost of living adjustment", split into "total" vs others. 

Then, for the "total" group, maybe split on health plan. 

Alternatively, but this might not be as critical.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on "employer's contribution towards the health plan", then the second split on "first year wage increase".

Given the uncertainty, I'll proceed with the first idea I had:

Root: employer's contribution towards the health plan (full vs not full)
   |--- full → class: good
   |--- not full
       |--- cost of living adjustment = total → class: good
       |--- else → class: bad

This uses two features, is depth 2, and follows logical splits based on typical priorities in labor negotiations.
</think>

The decision tree for predicting the outcome of a labor negotiation based on key features, structured with a maximum depth of 2, is as follows:

### **Decision Tree Structure**
**Root Node:**  
**Feature:** Employer's contribution towards the health plan  
- **Split:**  
  - **If "Full" contribution:**  
    - **Outcome:** Good (Leaf Node)  
  - **If "Not Full" (Half or None):**  
    - Proceed to the next split.  

**Second-Level Nodes (for "Not Full" branch):**  
**Feature:** Cost of living adjustment  
- **Split:**  
  - **If "Total" adjustment:**  
    - **Outcome:** Good (Leaf Node)  
  - **If "Temporary" or "None":**  
    - **Outcome:** Bad (Leaf Node)  

### **Explanation**
1. **Root Node (Health Plan Contribution):**  
   The employer's health plan contribution is the most critical factor. If the contribution is "Full," the outcome is deemed "Good," as comprehensive health benefits are typically a strong positive indicator.  

2. **Second-Level Split (Cost of Living Adjustment):**  
   For cases where the health plan is not full ("Half" or "None"), the next critical factor is the **cost of living adjustment**.  
   - If the adjustment is "Total" (e.g., full compensation for inflation or cost-of-living changes), the outcome is still "Good."  
   - If the adjustment is "Temporary" or "None," the outcome is "Bad," as insufficient adjustments may lead to dissatisfaction.

### **Visual Representation**
```
Root: Employer's Health Plan Contribution
├── Full → Good (Leaf)
└── Not Full → Cost of Living Adjustment
    ├── Total → Good (Leaf)
    └── Temporary/None → Bad (Leaf)
```

### **Rationale**
- **Health Plan Contribution:** Prioritizes comprehensive benefits, a key driver of employee satisfaction.  
- **Cost of Living Adjustment:** Addresses financial stability, especially critical when health benefits are lacking.  

This structure ensures a logical, depth-2 decision path based on typical priorities in labor negotiations.

<think>

Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a Python function that implements a decision tree based on the provided features and their descriptions. The function needs to return a prediction and a list of node truth values indicating which conditions were met.

First, I need to understand the features and their possible values. The target variable is 'target', which is 0 or 1. The features include things like 'duration', wage increases over three years, cost of living adjustments, working hours, pension options, various pays and allowances, statutory holidays, vacation options, disability assistance, dental and health plan contributions, etc.

The example given uses HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level with thresholds. So I need to come up with similar conditions for the labor negotiation features. Since there's no provided decision tree structure, I have to make educated guesses based on typical decision trees for such data.

I should start by selecting the most impactful features. Maybe the wage increases are critical. For example, if the wage increase in any year is too low, it might lead to a bad settlement. Let's think: perhaps if the first year's wage increase is below a certain threshold, it's a bad deal. Alternatively, the duration of the agreement might matter; a longer duration (like 7 years) might be better or worse?

Looking at the features' ranges:
- duration: 1-7 years. Maybe a longer duration is better?
- wage increases: 2.0 to 7.0. If the first year's increase is below, say, 4, that's bad.
- working hours: 35-40. Maybe 35 is better than 40?
- pension: categories like 'none', 'ret_allw', 'empl_contr'. So if pension is 'none', that's worse.
- vacation: 'ba', 'avg', 'gnr'. Probably 'ba' is basic and worse than average or good.
- Contribution to dental/health plans: 'none', 'half', 'full'. Full contributions are better.

But how do these translate into decision nodes?

Let's think step by step. The decision tree structure isn't given, so I'll have to create a plausible one. Let's start with the first split. Maybe the first node checks the wage increase first year. Suppose if wage increase first year is less than 4.5, then it's a bad deal. But maybe another feature is more important. Alternatively, the duration might be first: if duration is longer than 4 years, then check another condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'cost of living adjustment' (COLA) is important. The COLA can be 'none', 'tcf', or 'tc'. If it's 'none', that's worse, so maybe the first split checks if COLA is not 'none'. But how to represent that in a condition?

Wait, the problem says to use the features as per their keys. The features like 'cost of living adjustment' have categorical values, so I need to encode the conditions appropriately. For example, if the feature is 'none', then maybe the condition is (X['cost of living adjustment'] != 'none') which would be a boolean.

But how to structure this into a decision tree? Let me try to imagine a simple tree structure. Let's suppose the first split is on wage increase first year. Let's say if the first year wage increase is less than 5, then go left; else right. Then, in the next node, maybe check the pension. So the nodes list would have entries for each condition.

Alternatively, maybe the first node is the duration. For instance, if duration >= 5, then check another feature like the third year wage increase. Otherwise, check something else.

Wait, the example given in the problem uses a depth 2 tree with two nodes. So maybe the user expects a similar simple structure here. Let's aim for a depth of 2 or 3.

Let me think of a possible path:

Suppose the first node checks the wage increase first year. If it's less than 5, then check another condition (like working hours). If it's over 5, then maybe the settlement is good.

Alternatively, first node: wage increase first year <= 5.5. If true, check another feature like the pension. If false, maybe check the third year wage increase.

Alternatively, the first split could be on the pension. For example, if pension is 'none', then the result is bad (0), otherwise check another feature.

Wait, maybe that's better. Because if the employer doesn't contribute to the pension, that's a red flag. So:

First node: if pension == 'none' → then prediction is 0 (bad). Else, proceed to the next node.

The next node could be about wage increases. Let's say, if the first year wage increase is below 4.5, then bad, else good.

Wait, but how to code that in the nodes list. The nodes list is for the inner nodes, so each node is a condition that splits the tree.

Alternatively, let's try building a sample tree structure step by step:

Root node: Check if the 'cost of living adjustment' is not 'none'. If yes (meaning it's either tcf or tc), then proceed to next node. If no (it's none), then predict bad (0).

Wait, but maybe even with COLA, other factors matter. Alternatively, let's go with the example's style.

Alternatively, let's go for a tree where:

First node: wage increase first year > 5 → if yes, then check second node (e.g., pension is not none). If pension is not none, then good (1), else maybe bad. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, a two-level tree:

Node 0: wage_increase_first_year <= 5.5 → if true, then node 1 checks the pension. If node0 is false (i.e., wage is >5.5), then predict good (1).

Wait, perhaps:

First node (node 0): X['wage increase first year'] <= 5.5 → if yes, then go to node 1 (second node). If no, predict 1 (good).

Second node (node1): X['pension'] != 'none' → if yes, predict 1 (good), else 0 (bad).

Wait, but then the structure would be:

if node0 (wage1 <=5.5):

   if node1 (pension != 'none'): prediction 1 else 0

else (wage1>5.5): prediction 1

So in code:

nodes[0] = (X['wage increase first year'] <=5.5)

nodes[1] = (X['pension'] != 'none')

Then:

if nodes[0]:

    if nodes[1]:

        prediction =1

    else:

        prediction=0

else:

    prediction=1

But this is just a possible structure. But what's the rationale here? If the first year wage is over 5.5, it's a good deal. If it's lower, then it depends on pension. If pension is provided (not none), then it's still good, else bad.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the duration. Let's say if duration is less than 4 years, then check another condition, else maybe good?

Alternatively, maybe the first node is 'vacation' being 'gnr' (good). Because vacation is categorized as 'ba', 'avg', 'gnr'. Maybe if vacation is 'gnr', it's better.

Hmm, but without knowing the actual decision tree, it's tricky. The user is asking to format a decision tree as a Python function, but the original decision tree structure isn't provided. Wait, the user says "Here are the exact keys...", but perhaps they forgot to include the decision tree structure? Because the user's initial message seems to have a structure that starts with "Here are the exact keys...", but perhaps in the original problem, there was a decision tree structure?

Wait, looking back, the user's first message says "format this decision tree as a Python function..." but then provides the features. The example given is for a diabetes prediction. Maybe the user intended that I create a hypothetical decision tree based on the features provided, similar to the diabetes example?

Yes, I think that's the case. The user wants me to make up a plausible decision tree structure based on the features given, then code it into a Python function.

So my task is to imagine a decision tree structure for the labor negotiation target, using the features, and code it into the function format provided in the example.

Alright, let's proceed.

First, I need to choose the root node. Let's pick a feature that's likely to have a big impact. The wage increases over three years are probably important. Let's start with the first year wage increase. Maybe if the first year's increase is below a certain threshold, it's a bad deal. Let's say the threshold is 4.5.

Root node: wage increase first year <= 4.5 → if true, then maybe check another feature. Else, check another node.

Suppose the next node (depth 2) is about the pension. If the pension is 'none', then it's bad. Else, maybe good.

Alternatively, maybe after the first split, the next split is on the second year wage increase.

Alternatively, let's try to create a depth 2 tree similar to the example.

Example had two nodes, so let's make our decision tree also of depth 2, with two nodes.

First node (node 0): wage increase first year <= 5.0 → if yes, proceed to node 1. If no, predict good (1).

Second node (node 1): pension == 'none' → if yes (meaning pension is none), predict bad (0). Else, predict good (1).

Wait, but that would structure as follows:

If node0 (wage1 <=5):

   if node1 (pension is none) → 0 else 1

else → 1

So in code:

nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] <=5.0

nodes[1] = (X['pension'] == 'none')

Then:

if nodes[0]:

    if nodes[1]:

        prediction =0

    else:

        prediction=1

else:

    prediction=1

This is a possible structure.

Alternatively, maybe the second node is about the third year's wage increase. For instance, if the first year's wage is low (<=5), but the third year's is high, maybe it's still okay.

Alternatively, let's think again. Maybe the first split is on the duration. If the duration is >=5 years, then it's a long-term contract, which might be considered good if other terms are okay. Alternatively, shorter contracts might be bad.

Wait, duration ranges from 1 to 7. Maybe if the duration is less than 3, it's bad, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, combining wage and vacation.

Alternatively, perhaps the first node is on the cost of living adjustment. If it's 'none', then the prediction is bad unless other factors offset it.

Alternatively, let's try another approach. Suppose the first node checks if the wage increase in the third year is below 4. Then, proceed to check another condition.

Alternatively, maybe the first node is about the standby pay. If it's too low (like <5), then it's bad.

Hmm. Let me try to think of a more logical path. Let me consider that a good settlement would have decent wage increases, reasonable working hours, pension contributions, and good health/dental plans. So the decision tree might check these factors in a priority order.

Let me try this structure:

Root node (node0): wage increase first year <= 5.5 → if yes, then proceed to node1. If no (wage1>5.5), predict good (1).

Node1: pension == 'none' → if yes (no pension), predict bad (0). Else (pension is present), predict good (1).

This way, the first split is on the first year wage. If it's too low, then check the pension. If pension is provided, then it's still good, else bad. But if the first year wage is high enough, it's good regardless.

Alternatively, maybe the second node is about the third year wage. Let's say:

Node0: wage1 <=5.5 → if yes, check node1: wage3 <=3 → if yes, bad, else good.

But without knowing the actual data distribution, it's hard. Let's proceed with the previous idea.

Now, coding that structure:

def predict(X: dict):

    nodes = [0]*2

    nodes[0] = (X['wage increase first year'] <=5.5)

    nodes[1] = (X['pension'] == 'none')

    if nodes[0]:

        if nodes[1]:

            prediction =0

        else:

            prediction=1

    else:

        prediction=1

    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but in Python, the nodes list should have 1 for the truth value. Wait, the problem says the list entries should be 1 if the condition is satisfied, else 0. So nodes should be a list where each element is 1 or 0.

Ah, right! So in the example, the nodes are stored as booleans, then converted to 1/0? Or perhaps the nodes are stored as integers directly.

Wait, looking at the example given:

In the example function:

nodes[0] = X["HbA1c_level"] <= 6.7 → which is a boolean (True/False)

nodes[1] = X["blood_glucose_level"] <= 210 → also boolean.

Then, the return is prediction and nodes, which are the list of booleans. But the problem says the list entries should be 1 or 0. So perhaps the nodes list needs to be integers instead of booleans. Wait, in the example, they used booleans but the problem says entries should be 1 or 0, so maybe the function should cast them to integers?

Wait, the example code returns the nodes as booleans, but the problem says the list should have 1 and 0. So perhaps the nodes list is supposed to be integers. Therefore, in our code, we need to store 1 or 0 instead of booleans.

Wait, in the example, the nodes are stored as booleans, then when returned, they are treated as 1/0 when converted to integers. Wait, but in the example's code, the nodes are stored as booleans, but the problem says entries are 1 or 0, so perhaps the function should cast the booleans to integers.

Wait, let me recheck the user's instruction:

"the list entries should be 1 if the condition is satisfied, else 0".

Therefore, in the code, the nodes list should be integers (0 or 1), not booleans.

Therefore, in the code, we need to compute each node's condition as a boolean, then store 1 or 0.

In the example provided by the user:

def predict(...):

    nodes = [False, False]

    nodes[0] = X["HbA1c_level"] <= 6.7 → which is a boolean

    nodes[1] = X["blood_glucose_level"] <= 210 → boolean

    then return prediction, nodes

But the user says entries should be 1/0. So perhaps the example is incorrect, or maybe in the problem statement it's allowed to be booleans but the user wants integers.

Therefore, to comply with the problem's instruction, we should store integers.

Hence, in the code:

nodes[0] = 1 if (X['wage increase first year'] <=5.5) else 0

nodes[1] = 1 if (X['pension'] == 'none') else 0

Wait, but in Python, you can't assign to a list element like that. You have to compute it:

nodes[0] = int(X['wage increase first year'] <=5.5)

nodes[1] = int(X['pension'] == 'none')

Yes, because in Python, True is 1 and False is 0 when converted to integers.

So that would work.

Therefore, the code would be:

def predict(X: dict):

    nodes = [0]*2

    nodes[0] = int(X['wage increase first year'] <=5.5)

    nodes[1] = int(X['pension'] == 'none')

    if nodes[0]:

        if nodes[1]:

            prediction =0

        else:

            prediction=1

    else:

        prediction=1

    return prediction, nodes

But let's verify this structure with some test cases.

Suppose first_year_wage is 5.0 (<=5.5 → node0=1), pension is 'none' (node1=1). Then prediction is 0.

If first_year is 5.0, pension is 'some value', node1 is 0 → prediction is 1.

If first_year is 6.0 (node0=0), then prediction is 1 regardless of pension.

Another example: first_year is 5.5 (node0=1), pension is not none → prediction 1.

Another test: first_year 4.0, pension 'none' → prediction 0.

This seems reasonable.

Alternatively, maybe the second node should be about the third year wage or something else, but given the lack of a provided tree, this is an acceptable assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the first node is about the duration.

Wait, another possibility:

Suppose the root node is the duration: if duration <4, then it's bad unless other conditions are met.

Suppose:

Node0: X['duration'] <4 → if yes, then proceed to node1.

Node1: X['wage increase first year'] >5 → if yes, then predict 1, else 0.

Else (duration >=4): predict 1.

But this is another possible structure.

Alternatively, let's think of a different approach where the first node is about the combined wage increases.

Alternatively, let's consider another structure with three nodes, but the example used two nodes. To keep it simple, maybe two nodes are better.

Alternatively, perhaps the first node is about the combined wage increases over three years, but it's hard without data.

Alternatively, here's another idea:

First node: total_wage_increase = (wage1 + wage2 + wage3) /3 >4.5 → if yes, predict good. Else, check next node.

But without data, this is guesswork.

Alternatively, let's use the following structure:

Node0: wage increase third year <=3 → if yes, then check node1 (pension is none) → bad. Else good.

Wait, but again, just making this up.

Alternatively, let me try another structure where the first node is about the third year wage.

Node0: wage3 <=3 → if yes, then node1 checks the pension.

If node0 is true (wage3 is too low), then if pension is none → bad (0), else maybe okay (1).

Wait, no, this may not be logical.

Alternatively, perhaps the first node is about the working hours. Suppose working hours are a feature, but it's not listed in the keys provided. Wait, the user provided the features as exact keys:

The features given are:

Looking back at the user's message:

"Here are the exact keys..." but in the user's message, they provided:

The features are:

wage increase first year

wage increase second year

wage increase third year

duration (probably in years)

pension (categorical: 'none', 'some', 'good'?)

vacation (ba, avg, gnr)

standby pay

health insurance

etc.

Wait, the user's message lists the features as "exact keys", but in the initial query, perhaps they were listed but got truncated? The user's initial message says:

"Now are the exact keys...", but maybe in the original problem, there was a list of features.

Wait, looking at the user's message in the problem description (copied here):

User message:

"Now are the exact keys..." but in the actual problem, the user lists the features. Wait, the user's message shows:

"Here are the exact keys of the features: [wage increase first year, wage increase second year, wage increase third year, duration, pension, vacation, standby pay, health insurance, etc.]"

Assuming that's the case, but perhaps the exact features are:

- wage increase first year

- wage increase second year

- wage increase third year

- duration (of contract)

- pension (type)

- vacation benefits (ba, avg, gnr)

- standby pay (amount)

- health insurance (type)

- etc.

Thus, given that, perhaps the decision tree should consider these factors.

Alternatively, let's try another approach where the first node is about the health insurance. If health insurance is 'none', then it's bad, but that might be too strong.

Alternatively, to make a more balanced decision tree, maybe:

Root node: Whether the total wage increases are sufficient. Let's say the average of the three years' wage increases is above 4.5.

Total = (w1 + w2 + w3)/3 >4.5 → if yes, predict good. Else, check next node.

Next node: If pension is not none → predict good, else bad.

But this would require three wage features, but the nodes list would have to have more nodes. Since the example uses two nodes, maybe we should stick with two.

Alternatively, let's try this structure:

Node0: wage increase first year <=5.0 → if yes, then check node1 (vacation is 'gnr'). If vacation is 'gnr', then good (1), else bad (0). Else (wage first >5), predict 1.

Thus:

nodes[0] = (wage1 <=5.0 → 1/0)

nodes[1] = (vacation == 'gnr' → 1/0)

Then:

if nodes[0]:

    if nodes[1]:

        prediction=1

    else:

        prediction=0

else:

    prediction=1

This way, if first year wage is low, but vacation is good (gnr), then it's still considered good.

Alternatively, this is another plausible structure.

Given the uncertainty, perhaps I can proceed with one of these structures. Let me choose the first one I thought of:

Root node: wage1 <=5.5 → node0=1 if yes.

Node1: pension is 'none' → node1=1 if yes.

Then:

if node0 (wage low):

   if node1 (pension none): 0 else 1

else (wage high): 1

This seems logical.

Thus, the code would be as follows:

def predict(X: dict):

    nodes = [0]*2

    # Node 0: wage increase first year <=5.5

    nodes[0] = 1 if (X['wage increase first year'] <=5.5) else 0

    # Node 1: pension is 'none'

    nodes[1] = 1 if (X['pension'] == 'none') else 0

    # Determine prediction

    if nodes[0]:

        if nodes[1]:

            prediction =0

        else:

            prediction =1

    else:

        prediction =1

    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but in Python, the list can be initialized as:

nodes = []

nodes.append( ... )

But in the example, they used nodes = [False, False], so here:

nodes = [0, 0]

nodes[0] = ... 

nodes[1] = ... 

Yes, that's okay.

This code should work. However, we need to make sure that the keys used in the dictionary match exactly what the user provided. The user mentioned "pension" as a feature, so that's okay.

Another consideration: The user might have 'pension' as a categorical variable where 'none' is one of the options, so comparing to 'none' is valid.

Therefore, this code should satisfy the problem's requirements.

Alternatively, another possible structure is to have the first node be about the duration. Let's suppose:

Node0: duration <3 → node0=1 (if short duration), else 0.

Node1: wage increase first year >5 → if yes, then good.

Then:

If duration is short (node0=1):

   if wage first >5 → prediction 1 else 0.

Else (duration long):

   prediction 1.

Thus:

def predict(X):

    nodes = [0,0]

    nodes[0] = 1 if X['duration'] <3 else 0

    nodes[1] = 1 if X['wage increase first year']>5 else 0

    if nodes[0]:

        prediction = nodes[1]

    else:

        prediction =1

    return prediction, nodes

This is another possible structure, but again, without knowing the exact features and their impact, it's hard to choose. Given the problem's lack of specifics, I'll proceed with the first structure I mentioned, which uses wage and pension as factors.

Final code as above.
