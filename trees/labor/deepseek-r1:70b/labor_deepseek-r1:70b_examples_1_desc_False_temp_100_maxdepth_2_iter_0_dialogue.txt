Alright, so I need to build a decision tree classifier using the given features to determine whether labor negotiations are good or bad. The maximum depth is 2, which means the tree can have at most two levels of splits after the root.

First, let me list out all the features provided:

1. Duration of agreement (1 to 7)
2. Wage increase in first year of contract (2 to 7)
3. Wage increase in second year of contract (2 to 7)
4. Wage increase in third year of contract (2 to 7)
5. Cost of living adjustment (none / temporary formula / total compensation adjustment)
6. Number of working hours during week (35 to 40)
7. Employer contributions to pension plan (none / retirement allowance included / employee contribution)
8. Standby pay (2 to 25)
9. Shift differential: supplement for work on 2nd and 3rd shift (1 to 25)
10. Education allowance (yes / no)
11. Number of statutory holidays (9 to 15)
12. Number of paid vacation days (below average / average / generous)
13. Employer's help during employee long-term disability (yes / no)
14. Employer's contribution towards the dental plan (none / half / full)
15. Employer's financial contribution towards bereavement costs (yes / no)
16. Employer's contribution towards the health plan (none / half / full)

Okay, that's a lot of features. Since we need to build a decision tree with max depth 2, I have to select the most important features first.

What defines a "good" or "bad" outcome in labor negotiations? Typically, factors like wage increases, working hours, pension contributions, vacation days, and health benefits are significant. Let's prioritize these.

Wage increase over three years seems crucial because it directly affects employees' financial well-being. A higher increase would likely be seen as a good outcome. Similarly, the number of paid vacation days is important for work-life balance. Generous vacation days would be positive.

Cost of living adjustment (COLA) is another key factor because it helps employees cope with inflation. A total compensation adjustment is better than temporary or none.

Number of working hours is also significant. Fewer hours (like 35) could be better, but I'm not sure if the range is from 35 to 40, so maybe lower within that range is better? Or perhaps it's more about whether it's reasonable, say <=37 vs >37?

Employer contributions to pension and health plans are also important. Full contribution would be best.

Shift differential might matter for those working evenings or nights; higher supplements could make the outcome better.

Education allowance and help during disability are also positives.

So, considering all these, I need to choose two features as the primary splits because of max depth 2.

I think wage increases and vacation days are top priorities. Let's say first split is based on average wage increase over three years.

But wait, each year's wage increase is a separate feature. Maybe I should combine them somehow or take the average? Alternatively, maybe the third year's increase is more indicative of long-term benefits.

Alternatively, total compensation adjustment in COLA might be a strong indicator because it directly affects all employees' financial status beyond just wages.

But considering the features, wage increases are probably more impactful. So perhaps I should use the sum or average of the three wage increases as the first split.

Wait, but each is a separate feature, so maybe using the third year's increase as a key indicator because it shows long-term commitment.

Alternatively, let me think about which single feature best captures the overall benefit. Maybe the total compensation adjustment in COLA is a strong single feature because it affects all employees regardless of their individual circumstances.

So first split: Cost of living adjustment.

If COLA is "total compensation adjustment", that's the best case. If it's "temporary" or "none", then we need to look at other features.

Then, for those with temporary or no COLA, perhaps the next most important feature would be wage increases or vacation days.

But wait, if I choose COLA as the first split, the left branch (total compensation) leads directly to a good outcome. The right branch (temporary or none) would need another split.

In that case, for the right branch, what's the next best feature? Maybe the average wage increase over three years or the third year's wage increase.

Alternatively, number of paid vacation days is a significant factor because it affects work-life balance and employee satisfaction. So perhaps if COLA isn't total, then we check if vacation days are generous.

Putting this together:

First split: Cost of living adjustment.

- If "total compensation adjustment": good outcome.
- Else, check the next feature.

What should be the second feature? Maybe number of paid vacation days because it's a clear indicator. So:

If COLA is not total:
    - Check if vacation days are generous.
        - If yes: good.
        - If no (average or below): bad.

But wait, I need to make sure that this structure uses only two splits, so depth 2.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the sum of wage increases as the first split. Let's say if the total wage increase over three years is above a certain threshold, it's good. Otherwise, check another feature like vacation days.

But since I can't combine features, perhaps focusing on individual ones is better.

Let me try:

First split: Wage increase in third year of contract > 5? (Assuming scale is 2-7, so mid-point around 4.5).

If yes: good outcome.
If no: check another feature like vacation days.

But the user didn't specify target variables, but I'm assuming "good" or "bad". So perhaps using wage increase in third year as first split.

Wait, maybe it's better to use the average of the three years. Let me think about possible thresholds.

Alternatively, considering that higher values are better for all features except working hours (where lower is better), but working hours range from 35-40, which might not be a strong indicator unless it's specifically 35 vs 36+, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, number of statutory holidays could be another factor. Higher is better, so maybe if >=12, but the range is 9-15.

But perhaps focusing on more direct financial benefits like wage increases and COLA is better.

I think the best approach is:

1st split: Cost of living adjustment.
    - If "total compensation": good.
    - Else:
        2nd split: Wage increase in third year > some value, say 5 (since scale is 2-7).
            - If yes: good.
            - Else: bad.

But wait, I need to define the second split as a feature and a threshold. Let me choose the features first.

Alternatively:

1st split: Average of wage increases over three years > let's say 5 (since 2+3+4=9 average is 3, but maybe higher). Wait, but it's three separate features, so I can't combine them. So perhaps just use third year as an indicator.

But I think using COLA as the first split makes sense because it's a comprehensive adjustment.

So:

Decision Tree:
|--- cost of living adjustment == 'total compensation adjustment'
||--- class: good
|--- cost of living adjustment != 'total compensation adjustment'
    |--- wage increase in third year of contract > 5.0
        ||--- class: good
        |--- wage increase in third year of contract <= 5.0
            ||--- class: bad

Wait, but the user's example used <= and > with specific thresholds. So maybe I should define it that way.

But let me check if this makes sense. If COLA is total, it's good. Otherwise, if the third year wage increase is above a certain point (say 5), still good; else bad.

Alternatively, another feature could be number of paid vacation days as the second split.

So:

|--- cost of living adjustment == 'total compensation adjustment'
||--- class: good
|--- cost of living adjustment != 'total compensation adjustment'
    |--- number of paid vacation days == 'generous'
        ||--- class: good
        |--- number of paid vacation days != 'generous'
            ||--- class: bad

That might be better because both COLA and vacation days are strong indicators.

Alternatively, combining wage increases and vacation days. But with max depth 2, I can only have two splits.

I think using COLA as the first split is logical because it's a direct financial benefit affecting all employees. If that's not present, then looking at vacation days (which affect work-life balance) makes sense.

So the tree would look like:

|--- cost of living adjustment == 'total compensation adjustment'
||--- class: good
|--- cost of living adjustment != 'total compensation adjustment'
    |--- number of paid vacation days == 'generous'
        ||--- class: good
        |--- number of paid vacation days != 'generous'
            ||--- class: bad

But I need to represent it with thresholds as in the example, but since some features are categorical, maybe using == and !=.

Alternatively, for numerical features like wage increases, use <= and >, but for categorical, use specific values.

So perhaps:

|--- cost of living adjustment == 'total compensation adjustment'
||--- class: good
|--- cost of living adjustment != 'total compensation adjustment'
    |--- number of paid vacation days == 'generous'
        ||--- class: good
        |--- number of paid vacation days != 'generous'
            ||--- class: bad

Yes, this makes sense. If COLA is total, it's a good outcome regardless of other factors. If not, then if vacation days are generous, still good; otherwise, bad.

Alternatively, another approach could be using wage increases as the first split and COLA as the second, but I think COLA is more impactful because it's an adjustment for all employees.

I think this structure captures the most important features effectively within a max depth of 2.

To classify whether labor negotiations are good or bad based on the given features with a maximum decision tree depth of 2, we prioritize the most significant factors affecting employee well-being and financial stability. The decision tree is constructed as follows:

|--- cost of living adjustment == 'total compensation adjustment'
||--- class: good
|--- cost of living adjustment != 'total compensation adjustment'
    |--- number of paid vacation days == 'generous'
        ||--- class: good
        |--- number of paid vacation days != 'generous'
            ||--- class: bad

**Decision Tree Explanation:**

1. **First Split (Cost of Living Adjustment):**
   - If the agreement includes a "total compensation adjustment," it is classified as a good outcome because this adjustment comprehensively supports all employees financially.
   
2. **Second Split (Number of Paid Vacation Days):**
   - For cases where COLA is not total, we then examine the number of paid vacation days. Generous vacation days enhance work-life balance and employee satisfaction, leading to a good classification. If the vacation days are average or below, it results in a bad outcome.

This tree effectively uses two critical features to determine the negotiation result within the specified depth constraint.

Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, the user wants a Python function that predicts whether labor negotiations are good or bad based on certain features. The decision tree needs to have a maximum depth of 2 and should return both the prediction and a list indicating whether each inner node condition was met.

First, I need to understand the features provided. There's quite an extensive list here, including things like 'cost of living adjustment', 'wage increase first year', 'vacation', etc. Each feature has specific possible values or ranges, so I'll have to handle them appropriately in the function.

The target variable is either 0 (bad) or 1 (good), representing the outcome of the negotiations. The example provided earlier used 'cost of living adjustment' and 'vacation' as the primary features for the decision tree. That makes sense because these factors significantly impact employees' financial stability and overall satisfaction.

So, to structure this, I'll need to create a function that takes a dictionary `X` with all these features. The function will evaluate the conditions based on the decision tree logic.

First, check if 'cost of living adjustment' is 'tc'. If it is, then regardless of other factors, the outcome is good (1). 

If 'cost of living adjustment' is not 'tc', we move to the second condition: checking if 'vacation' is 'gnr'. If it's generous, the outcome is still good; otherwise, it's bad.

Now, I also need to keep track of the inner node conditions in a list. Each condition will be represented as a boolean (1 for True, 0 for False). So, the first element in the nodes list corresponds to whether 'cost of living adjustment' was 'tc', and the second element corresponds to whether 'vacation' was 'gnr'.

I need to make sure that I handle all possible values correctly. For instance, 'cost of living adjustment' can be 'none', 'tcf', or 'tc'. Similarly, 'vacation' can be 'ba', 'avg', or 'gnr'. The function should not throw errors if unexpected values are passed, but ideally, it should be robust enough to handle the specified options.

Also, I have to ensure that the keys in the dictionary `X` exactly match what's expected. The example provided shows that feature names can be quite specific, including spaces and exact cases, so typos could cause issues.

Testing this function with sample data would be a good idea. For example:

- If 'cost of living adjustment' is 'tc', prediction should be 1, and nodes[0] = True (1), nodes[1] might not matter but needs to reflect if it was checked.
- If 'cost of living adjustment' is 'tcf' and 'vacation' is 'gnr', prediction should be 1. Nodes would show False for the first condition and True for the second.
- If both conditions fail, prediction is 0.

I also need to make sure that the return statement correctly returns an integer (0 or 1) for the prediction and a list of integers (1s and 0s) representing the nodes.

Another consideration is how to handle missing data. If any required feature is missing from `X`, the function might throw a KeyError. Maybe adding some error handling would make it more robust, but since the user didn't specify that, I'll proceed under the assumption that all necessary features are present in `X`.

Lastly, ensuring that the code is clean and well-commented will help anyone reading it understand how the decision tree is structured and why certain features were chosen over others.

In summary, I need to:

1. Define the function with appropriate parameters.
2. Extract relevant features from `X`.
3. Implement the decision logic based on the specified conditions.
4. Track the inner node evaluations in a list.
5. Return both the prediction and the nodes list.

Now, putting all this together into code should give me the desired Python function that meets the user's requirements.
</think>

Here is the formatted decision tree as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict) -> tuple[int, list[int]]:
    """
    Predicts whether labor negotiations are good or bad based on the given features.

    Args:
        X (dict): Dictionary containing the feature values for a single instance.

    Returns:
        tuple[int, list[int]]: A tuple where the first element is the prediction (0 for bad, 1 for good)
                              and the second element is a list of integers representing the truth values
                              of the inner nodes in the decision tree.
    """
    
    # Initialize the list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = [None, None]  # We have two inner nodes in this tree

    # First condition: Check if 'cost of living adjustment' is 'tc'
    cost_of_living_adjustment = X['cost of living adjustment']
    nodes[0] = 1 if (cost_of_living_adjustment == 'tc') else 0

    prediction = 0  # Default to bad outcome

    if nodes[0]:  # If the first condition is true
        prediction = 1  # Outcome is good
    else:
        # Second condition: Check if 'vacation' is 'gnr'
        vacation = X['vacation']
        nodes[1] = 1 if (vacation == 'gnr') else 0

        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Outcome is good
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Outcome remains bad

    return prediction, [int(nodes[0]), int(nodes[1])]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values.
   - It returns a tuple with the predicted outcome (0 for bad, 1 for good) and a list of integers representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Extracts `'cost of living adjustment'` and `'vacation'` from the input dictionary `X`.

3. **Decision Tree Logic:**
   - First, it checks if `'cost of living adjustment'` is `'tc'`. If true, the outcome is immediately classified as good (1).
   - If the first condition is not met, it proceeds to check if `'vacation'` is `'gnr'`.
     - If `'vacation'` is `'gnr'`, the outcome is good (1).
     - Otherwise, the outcome is bad (0).

4. **Tracking Inner Nodes:**
   - The truth values of the inner nodes are stored in a list `nodes`. Each entry is converted to an integer (1 for True, 0 for False) before being returned.

This function effectively implements the decision tree logic and provides both the prediction and the evaluation of the inner node conditions.
