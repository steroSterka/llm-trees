Alright, so I need to build a decision tree classifier based on the given features to determine whether labor negotiations are good or bad. Let me start by understanding what each feature represents and how they might relate to the outcome.

First, looking at the features provided:

1. **Duration of Agreement (1 to 7 years)**: A longer agreement might mean more stability but could also delay future negotiations.
2. **Wage Increase in First Year (2 to 7%)**: Higher increases are better for employees.
3. **Wage Increase in Second Year (same scale)**: Consistency is key here; higher is better.
4. **Wage Increase in Third Year (same scale)**: Again, higher percentages benefit employees more.
5. **Cost of Living Adjustment (none / temporary formula / total compensation adjustment)**: Total compensation is the best for employees as it adjusts all earnings.
6. **Number of Working Hours (35 to 40)**: Fewer hours are better for work-life balance.
7. **Employer Pension Contributions (none / retirement allowance / employee contribution)**: Employer contributions are beneficial, so "retirement allowance" is positive.
8. **Standby Pay (2 to 25)**: Higher standby pay is better as it compensates employees for being on call.
9. **Shift Differential (1 to 25)**: Higher differentials mean better pay for less desirable shifts.
10. **Education Allowance (yes / no)**: Yes is positive as it supports employee development.
11. **Number of Statutory Holidays (9 to 15)**: More holidays are beneficial.
12. **Paid Vacation Days (below average / average / generous)**: Generous is best for employees.
13. **Employer Help During Longterm Disability (yes / no)**: Yes indicates better support.
14. **Dental Plan Contribution (none / half / full)**: Full contribution is best.
15. **Bereavement Financial Contribution (yes / no)**: Yes shows employer support during tough times.
16. **Health Plan Contribution (none / half / full)**: Full contribution is beneficial.

Since the goal is to classify negotiations as good or bad, I'll assume that higher values in most features indicate a better outcome for employees, hence a "good" result. So, the decision tree should identify key features that lead to this classification.

I think starting with the most impactful features makes sense. Wage increases and employer contributions are usually significant. Let's consider the wage increase in the first year as the root because it directly affects current compensation. If it's high (above a certain threshold), it might be a good outcome. If not, we can look into other factors like cost of living adjustments or pension contributions.

Wait, but maybe the duration of the agreement is more critical. A longer agreement might mean more job security but could also lock in lower terms for longer. However, wage increases are more directly tied to immediate benefits. So perhaps starting with the first-year wage increase is better.

Suppose we set a threshold at 5% for the first year. If it's above 5%, negotiations are good because employees get a substantial raise immediately. Below that, we need to look deeper. Next, in the sub-tree where first-year wage is <=5%, perhaps looking at the cost of living adjustment makes sense. Having a total compensation adjustment would be better than temporary or none, so if it's present, maybe negotiations are still good.

If there's no cost of living adjustment or only a temporary one, then we might need to check other benefits like pension contributions. If the employer contributes through a retirement allowance, that adds value beyond wages, making the outcome good. Otherwise, perhaps looking at standby pay or shift differentials as additional compensations could help determine if it's still a decent deal.

Alternatively, after wage increases, considering paid vacation days might be another indicator of work-life balance. Generous vacation days would make negotiations good even with slightly lower wage increases.

I think the key is to prioritize features that have the most significant impact on employees' financial and non-financial benefits. Wage increases are primary, followed by cost of living adjustments and employer contributions to benefits like pensions, health plans, etc. Secondary factors might include vacation days, holidays, standby pay, and shift differentials.

So structuring the tree: Start with first-year wage increase. If high (>5%), good. Else, check for total compensation adjustment. If present, good. Else, check if employer pension contributions are through retirement allowance. If yes, good. If not, maybe look at other factors like vacation days or health plan contributions.

Alternatively, using a different feature as the root might yield better results. Maybe the cost of living adjustment is more critical because it affects all earnings, not just the fixed wage increase. So starting with that: if there's a total compensation adjustment, good. If only temporary or none, then check first-year wage increase.

But I'm not sure which approach is better without data. Since this is a hypothetical tree, perhaps prioritizing features based on their perceived importance makes sense. Wage increases are usually the most negotiated item, so starting with that seems logical.

I should also consider how many levels deep the tree needs to be. Too deep might overcomplicate it, but too shallow might not capture all necessary factors. Maybe limiting to three or four levels would make it manageable.

Another thought: perhaps combining multiple wage years could provide a better picture of overall compensation growth. For example, if the total increase over three years is above a certain percentage, that's good. But since each year's increase is a separate feature, maybe aggregating them isn't straightforward without data processing.

In conclusion, I'll structure the decision tree starting with first-year wage increase as the root, then branching into cost of living adjustment, followed by pension contributions, and so on. This way, it prioritizes immediate financial benefits first, then adjusts based on other compensations.

To classify labor negotiations as good or bad, we prioritize features based on their impact on employee benefits. The decision tree is structured to evaluate immediate financial impacts first, followed by additional compensations.

### Decision Tree Structure:

1. **Root Node: Wage Increase in First Year**
   - If > 5%: Negotiations are classified as **Good** (immediate significant benefit).
   - If â‰¤ 5%: Proceed to the next feature for evaluation.

2. **First Sub-Node: Cost of Living Adjustment**
   - If Total Compensation Adjustment is present: Negotiations are **Good**.
   - If only Temporary or None: Continue to next feature.

3. **Second Sub-Node: Employer Pension Contributions**
   - If Retirement Allowance is included: Negotiations are **Good** (indicating employer support).
   - If none or only Employee Contribution: Proceed further.

4. **Third Sub-Node: Paid Vacation Days**
   - If Generous: Classified as **Good** (enhances work-life balance).
   - If Average or Below Average: Continue to next feature.

5. **Fourth Sub-Node: Health Plan Contribution**
   - If Full Contribution: Negotiations are **Good**.
   - If Half or None: May be considered **Bad**, but could explore other features like standby pay, shift differentials, etc., for final classification.

This tree prioritizes immediate financial benefits and then evaluates additional compensations to determine the overall outcome.

Alright, I need to help the user by creating a Python function that implements their decision tree for classifying labor negotiations as good or bad. The function should take a dictionary of features and return both a prediction (0 for bad, 1 for good) and a list of truth values representing the conditions evaluated in each inner node.

First, I'll review the decision tree structure they provided. It seems to prioritize certain features over others:

1. **Root Node:** Wage Increase in First Year. If it's above 5%, negotiations are immediately classified as good.
2. If not, check the Cost of Living Adjustment. If it's a total compensation adjustment, classify as good.
3. If that's not met, look at Employer Pension Contributions. Retirement allowance inclusion means good.
4. Next, evaluate Paid Vacation Days. Generous vacation days lead to a good classification.
5. Finally, assess Health Plan Contribution. Full contribution means good; otherwise, it might be bad.

Now, I need to map these features and their conditions into Python code. Each condition corresponds to an inner node, and the order matters as per the tree structure. 

I'll start by initializing a list of nodes, each representing a boolean value based on the feature's condition. Then, using if-elif statements, I'll navigate through the tree based on these node evaluations.

I should ensure that feature keys are correctly spelled and match the provided list to avoid KeyErrors. For example, 'wage increase first year' is the correct key, not 'wage_increase_first_year'.

Next, for each condition:
- The first node checks if 'wage increase first year' is greater than 5. If true, prediction is 1.
- If false, check the second node: 'cost of living adjustment' equals 'tc'.
- Continue this pattern through all nodes.

Finally, the function should return both the prediction and the list of booleans representing each node's condition.

I also need to make sure that the returned nodes list has 0s and 1s corresponding to whether each condition was met (True or False). So, I'll convert each boolean in the nodes list to an integer before returning it.

Testing with sample data would help ensure correctness. For example, if 'wage increase first year' is 6, the prediction should be 1, and the first node's value should be 1.
</think>

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree logic you described:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5  # Initialize nodes list with None
    
    # Node 0: Wage increase in first year > 5?
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] > 5.0
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
        return prediction, [int(nodes[0]), int(False), int(False), int(False), int(False)]
    
    # Node 1: Cost of living adjustment == 'tc'?
    nodes[1] = X["cost of living adjustment"] == "tc"
    if nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1
        return prediction, [int(nodes[0]), int(nodes[1]), int(False), int(False), int(False)]
    
    # Node 2: Employer pension contributions == 'ret_allw'?
    nodes[2] = X["pension"] == "ret_allw"
    if nodes[2]:
        prediction = 1
        return prediction, [int(nodes[0]), int(nodes[1]), int(nodes[2]), int(False), int(False)]
    
    # Node 3: Paid vacation days == 'gnr'?
    nodes[3] = X["vacation"] == "gnr"
    if nodes[3]:
        prediction = 1
        return prediction, [int(nodes[0]), int(nodes[1]), int(nodes[2]), int(nodes[3]), int(False)]
    
    # Node 4: Contribution to health plan == 'full'?
    nodes[4] = X["contribution to health plan"] == "full"
    if nodes[4]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 0
    
    # Convert all nodes to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- The function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values.
- It initializes a list of nodes to keep track of which conditions are met during the traversal of the decision tree.
- Each condition corresponds to an inner node in your decision tree:
  - Node 0: Wage increase in first year > 5?
  - Node 1: Cost of living adjustment == 'tc'?
  - Node 2: Employer pension contributions == 'ret_allw'?
  - Node 3: Paid vacation days == 'gnr'?
  - Node 4: Contribution to health plan == 'full'?
- The function returns:
  - `prediction`: The predicted class (0 = bad, 1 = good).
  - `nodes`: A list of integers where each element is 1 if the condition for that node was satisfied and 0 otherwise.

This implementation follows your decision tree logic while keeping track of which conditions are met during the prediction process.
