Alright, so I need to build a decision tree classifier that predicts whether labor negotiations will result in a good or bad outcome based on given features. The maximum depth allowed is 2, which means the tree can have at most two levels of splits below the root.

First, let me list out all the features provided:

1. Duration of agreement (1 to 7)
2. Wage increase in first year of contract (2 to 7)
3. Wage increase in second year of contract (2 to 7)
4. Wage increase in third year of contract (2 to 7)
5. Cost of living adjustment (none / temporary formula / total compensation)
6. Number of working hours during week (35 to 40)
7. Employer contributions to pension plan (none / retirement allowance included / employee contribution)
8. Standby pay (2 to 25)
9. Shift differential: supplement for work on 2 and 3 shifts (1 to 25)
10. Education allowance (yes / no)
11. Number of statutory holidays (9 to 15)
12. Number of paid vacation days (below average / average / generous)
13. Employer's help during employee long-term disability (yes / no)
14. Employer's contribution towards the dental plan (none / half / full)
15. Employer's financial contribution towards bereavement costs (yes / no)
16. Employer's contribution towards the health plan (none / half / full)

Since I'm limited to a maximum depth of 2, I need to choose the most important features that can split the data effectively into good or bad outcomes.

I think wage-related features are likely to be significant because they directly affect employees' financial well-being. So, let's consider the first year wage increase as the root node since it's a primary concern in negotiations. If the first year wage increase is high (let's say above 5), that might immediately indicate a good outcome.

For the second split, I need another feature. Maybe cost of living adjustment is important because it affects the real income. If there's no COLA or only temporary, it could lead to a bad outcome even with higher wages if inflation isn't accounted for. Alternatively, a total compensation adjustment would be better, so that might be a good split.

So, the root node splits on first year wage increase <= 5 and >5. Wait, but I need to think about how high is considered good. Maybe splitting at <=5 and >5 makes sense since 7 is the maximum.

Wait, in the example given earlier with the Iris dataset, petal width was split into three categories, but here I can only have two splits because of depth 2. So for each node after the root, it's only one more split.

So if first year wage increase >5 (good), then regardless of other factors, maybe it's a good outcome? That might not capture everything, but with limited depth, we need to prioritize.

Alternatively, let me think about other features that might be important. Maybe employer contributions to health plans or pension plans are also critical. But since I can only have two levels, perhaps the first split should be based on wage increase, then the second on COLA or another financial factor.

I'm a bit confused about how to choose which feature to use at each level. Maybe using Gini impurity or information gain would help, but without data, I have to make educated guesses.

Another approach is to consider that a good outcome likely has higher wage increases and better benefits. So, if the first year wage increase is high (>5), it's probably a good outcome. If it's low (<=5), then check another feature like COLA: if there's a total compensation adjustment, maybe it's still good; otherwise, bad.

Alternatively, after first split on wage, for the second split, use employer contributions to health plans or pension. But since we have limited splits, perhaps focusing on COLA is better because it directly impacts purchasing power.

So, putting this together:

Root: Wage increase in first year <=5 and >5

If >5, then outcome is good.

If <=5, check the next feature, say cost of living adjustment: if total compensation, then maybe still good; else, bad.

Wait, but how does that fit into a decision tree? It would look like:

- Wage increase first year >5: Good
- Wage increase first year <=5:
   - COLA is total compensation: Good
   - Else: Bad

That's within the max depth of 2. So each path from root to leaf is at most two splits.

Alternatively, maybe using another feature for the second split could be better. For example, number of paid vacation days being generous might indicate a good outcome even with lower wages.

But I think COLA is more directly tied to financial outcomes than vacation days. However, without data, it's hard to say which has more impact. But in negotiations, wage increases and cost of living adjustments are often primary concerns, so maybe focusing on those makes sense.

So, the decision tree would first split on wage increase first year >5. If yes, outcome is good. If no, then check COLA: if it's total compensation adjustment, then good; else, bad.

I think this structure captures the most important features effectively within the depth constraint.
</think>

Here is a structured decision tree based on the analysis of labor negotiation features to predict whether the outcome is good or bad:

1. **Root Node**: Wage Increase in First Year of Contract
   - Split at 5: If wage increase > 5, outcome is Good.
   
2. **First Level Nodes**:
   - **Wage Increase <=5**:
     - Second Feature: Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA)
       - If COLA is Total Compensation Adjustment, outcome is Good.
       - Otherwise (None or Temporary), outcome is Bad.

This decision tree prioritizes wage increases and cost of living adjustments as the most critical factors influencing negotiation outcomes.

<think>
Alright, so I need to create a Python function that predicts whether the outcome of labor negotiations is good or bad based on certain features. The decision tree has a maximum depth of two, and I should use the most important features.

First, let's recall what the user provided. They gave me a list of 17 features related to labor negotiations, such as duration of agreement, wage increases over three years, cost of living adjustments, working hours, pension contributions, standby pay, shift differentials, education allowance, statutory holidays, vacation days, longterm disability assistance, contribution to dental plan, bereavement assistance, and contribution to health plan. The target variable is binary: 0 for bad outcomes and 1 for good.

In the previous example, they built a decision tree where the first split was based on wage increase in the first year of the contract (>5 led to a good outcome), and if it's less than or equal to 5, then they looked at the cost of living adjustment. If COLA is "total compensation adjustment," then it's good; otherwise, it's bad.

So, for this new function, I need to follow a similar structure but ensure that the decision tree doesn't exceed depth two. That means after the root node (first feature), there can only be one additional split (second feature).

Given that, I should identify which features are most important or influential in determining the outcome. Wage increases seem critical because they directly impact employees' financial well-being and satisfaction. Cost of living adjustments also play a significant role as they help mitigate inflation's effects on wages.

Other features like pension contributions, standby pay, and vacation days could be important too, but since we need to limit depth, focusing on the most impactful ones is better.

So, let's plan out the decision tree:

1. **Root Node**: Wage increase in the first year of contract.
   - If wage increase > 5, outcome is Good (1).
   - Else, proceed to the next feature.

2. **Second Level Node**: Cost of living adjustment.
   - If COLA is "total compensation adjustment," outcome is Good (1).
   - Otherwise, outcome is Bad (0).

This structure fits within a maximum depth of two and uses what seem to be the most important features based on their impact on negotiation outcomes.

Now, I need to write this as a Python function. The function should take a dictionary `X` containing all the feature values and return both the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values representing the inner nodes' conditions.

I also need to map the features correctly, paying attention to their exact keys and encodings.

So, mapping the features:

- "wage increase first year": This is a numerical value ranging from 2.0 to 7.0.
- "cost of living adjustment": Categorical with options "none," "tcf," "tc."

For the function:

1. Extract the necessary feature values from `X`.
2. Check if wage increase in the first year > 5.
3. If true, set prediction to 1 and nodes accordingly.
4. If false, check the cost of living adjustment.
   - If COLA is "tc," set prediction to 1.
   - Else, set prediction to 0.
5. Return prediction and the list of node truth values.

I also need to ensure that the node list accurately reflects the conditions evaluated, with 1 for True and 0 for False.

Let me draft this:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2
    # First condition: wage increase first year > 5
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] > 5
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        # Second condition: cost of living adjustment == "tc"
        nodes[1] = (X["cost of living adjustment"] == "tc")
        prediction = 1 if nodes[1] else 0

    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but the user's example used a list where each element corresponds to the evaluation of each inner node. In their example, they had two nodes: one for HbA1c_level and another for blood_glucose_level.

In my case, I have two conditions: first on wage increase, then on COLA if needed.

So, the nodes list should reflect both evaluations, but in a depth-two tree, only two inner nodes are considered.

But looking back at their example, they filled `nodes` with evaluations of each condition as they went along. So in my function, I need to evaluate the first condition and then, depending on its result, possibly evaluate the second condition.

However, since we're using a list to represent all inner node conditions, both should be evaluated regardless of the path taken, right? Or is it only evaluating the necessary ones?

Wait, in their example, nodes[0] was set before the if-else, and nodes[1] was set within the else clause. So, for cases where the first condition is true, nodes[1] would not be evaluated.

But in our case, to represent all inner node conditions, regardless of the path, perhaps we should evaluate both upfront.

Alternatively, since it's a decision tree with depth two, and only one path can be taken, but the function needs to return the truth values for all inner nodes that could have been evaluated given the structure, not necessarily following the data path.

Hmm. This is a bit unclear from their example. In their example, if HbA1c_level <=6.7 is true (nodes[0] = True), then blood_glucose_level is checked only if nodes[0] is false.

Wait no, looking at their code:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["HbA1c_level"] <= 6.7
    nodes[1] = X["blood_glucose_level"] <= 210
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes

So regardless of the path taken, both nodes are evaluated. So in our function, we should evaluate both conditions upfront.

Therefore, I need to adjust my earlier approach:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2
    # First condition: wage increase first year > 5
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] > 5
    # Second condition: cost of living adjustment == "tc"
    nodes[1] = (X["cost of living adjustment"] == "tc")
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 1 if nodes[1] else 0

    return prediction, nodes

Yes, this way, both conditions are evaluated and stored in the nodes list regardless of which path is taken. This matches the user's example.

I should also ensure that the feature keys match exactly as provided, including spaces and casing.
</think>

Here is a Python function that predicts whether the outcome of labor negotiations is good (1) or bad (0) based on the given features using a decision tree of maximum depth 2. The function returns both the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2
    
    # Evaluate the first condition: wage increase in the first year > 5
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] > 5
    
    # Evaluate the second condition: cost of living adjustment is "tc"
    nodes[1] = (X["cost of living adjustment"] == "tc")
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 1 if nodes[1] else 0
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Decision Tree Structure:**
  - **Root Node:** `wage increase first year`
    - If `wage increase first year` is greater than 5, the outcome is predicted as good (1).
  - **Second Level Node:** `cost of living adjustment`
    - If `wage increase first year` is 5 or less, check the `cost of living adjustment`. 
      - If it is "tc" (total compensation adjustment), predict a good outcome (1).
      - Otherwise, predict a bad outcome (0).

- **Nodes List:**
  - The list contains boolean values representing the evaluation of each inner node condition. 
    - `nodes[0]` is `True` if `wage increase first year` > 5.
    - `nodes[1]` is `True` if `cost of living adjustment` equals "tc".

This function efficiently classifies the outcome using a shallow decision tree, ensuring clarity and interpretability while adhering to the specified constraints.
