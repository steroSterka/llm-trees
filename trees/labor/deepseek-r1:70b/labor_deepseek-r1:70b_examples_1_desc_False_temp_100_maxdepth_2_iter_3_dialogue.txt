Okay, so I need to build a decision tree classifier to determine whether labor negotiations are good or bad based on the given features. The maximum depth is 2, which means the tree can have at most two levels of splits. 

First, let me list all the features provided:

1. Duration of agreement (1 to 7)
2. Wage increase in first year (2 to 7)
3. Wage increase in second year (2 to 7)
4. Wage increase in third year (2 to 7)
5. Cost of living adjustment (none / temporary formula / total compensation)
6. Number of working hours during week (35 to 40)
7. Employer contributions to pension plan (none / retirement allowance included / employee contribution)
8. Standby pay (2 to 25)
9. Shift differential: supplement for work on shifts 2 and 3 (1 to 25)
10. Education allowance (yes / no)
11. Number of statutory holidays (9 to 15)
12. Number of paid vacation days (below average / average / generous)
13. Employer's help during long-term disability (yes / no)
14. Employer's contribution towards dental plan (none / half / full)
15. Employer's financial contribution towards bereavement costs (yes / no)
16. Employer's contribution towards health plan (none / half / full)

I need to decide which features are the most important for determining a good or bad outcome. Since it's a decision tree, I should choose features that have a strong correlation with the target variable.

Starting with wage increases: Wage increases over three years seem significant because they directly affect employees' financial well-being. A higher increase would likely lead to a good negotiation outcome. 

Next, cost of living adjustment is crucial because it helps protect against inflation, which is a key factor for employees. The type and generosity of this adjustment can significantly impact satisfaction.

Number of paid vacation days: Generous vacation time is often a desirable benefit, so this could be another important feature.

Employer contributions to pension plans: A good pension plan contributes to job satisfaction and security, so this might be a key factor.

Shift differential: Working on shifts 2 and 3 can be less desirable, so a higher supplement might make the negotiation outcome better if it compensates adequately for the inconvenience.

Standby pay is another financial factor that could influence how favorable the negotiations are perceived.

Number of statutory holidays: More days off are generally preferred by employees, so this could be important.

Employer contributions to dental and health plans: Better coverage usually leads to higher satisfaction.

Education allowance: Having an education allowance can be a significant benefit for personal growth.

Employer's help during disability: Support in times of need is crucial and would likely make negotiations seem good.

Financial contribution towards bereavement costs: This shows employer care beyond just financial benefits.

Working hours: The number of hours per week affects work-life balance, so this could influence the outcome.

Duration of agreement: Shorter agreements might allow for more frequent renegotiations, but too long might be seen as inflexible. However, I'm not sure about its importance relative to others.

Now, considering maximum depth of 2, I need to choose up to two features that are most influential.

Looking at the features, wage increase in the first year is a direct and immediate benefit, so it's likely very important. Also, cost of living adjustment has a broad impact on all employees' financial health, so combining these might be effective.

Alternatively, using paid vacation days as the second feature could capture work-life balance aspects. But I think wage increases are more directly tied to satisfaction than vacation days, although both are important.

I'll choose "wage increase in first year" as the first split because immediate financial benefits are a strong indicator of negotiation success.

For the second level, perhaps cost of living adjustment is next because it's another financial factor that affects all employees, regardless of individual circumstances. Alternatively, pension contributions or shift differential could be considered, but I think COLA is more universally impactful.

So, first split: wage increase in first year <= X. Then, within each branch, split based on cost of living adjustment.

But wait, the features are a mix of numerical and categorical variables. For the decision tree, handling both types would require converting categorical to numerical or using surrogate splits. However, since I'm just building the structure, I can denote the splits accordingly.

So, for "wage increase in first year", possible split points could be around 5 (since it's on a scale of 2-7). Then, within each branch, split based on whether COLA is 'total compensation adjustment' or not. Alternatively, create thresholds if treating it as numerical after encoding.

Alternatively, since some features like wage increases are numerical and others are categorical, maybe the most important feature after wage increase is pension contributions, which has three categories: none, retirement allowance, employee contribution. That could be another split point.

But I'm supposed to build a tree with maximum depth 2, so it's root plus two levels. The first split on wage increase in first year, then each branch splits again on another feature. So for the left child (wage <= X), perhaps the second split is based on COLA being 'none' or something else.

Alternatively, for the right child, maybe pension contributions are 'full' vs others.

Wait, but I need to rank the features by importance first. Wage increase in first year is definitely a top feature because immediate financial gains are critical. Then, perhaps cost of living adjustment as it's another financial factor that impacts all employees. Alternatively, shift differential or standby pay could be next because they address specific work conditions.

Alternatively, number of paid vacation days: generous, average, below average. This is also a significant quality-of-life factor.

But considering the weight, I think wage increase and COLA are more critical. So let me structure it that way.

So first split on wage increase in first year, perhaps at 5: if <=5, then proceed to check COLA; if >5, check another feature or classify directly.

Wait, but maximum depth is 2, so each branch can only have one more split. Therefore, after the root node splits into two based on wage increase, each of those nodes can split again once.

So for example:

Root: Wage first year <= X

Left child: COLA type

Right child: Pension contribution type

Each left and right would then classify as good or bad.

Alternatively, it could be structured with the same second feature for both branches, but I think using different features might capture more variance.

But perhaps to simplify, use COLA as the second split for both branches. Let's outline:

If Wage first year <= 5:
    If COLA is total compensation adjustment: Good
    Else: Bad
Else if Wage first year >5:
    If Pension contribution is full: Good
    Else: Bad

Wait, but maybe that doesn't cover all cases optimally.

Alternatively, perhaps using the same second feature for both branches. For example:

Root: Wage first <= 5

Left branch: COLA type splits into two
Right branch: COLA type splits into two

But given it's a maximum depth of 2, each path can only split once after root. So perhaps the tree will have four leaves.

Alternatively, use different features for each branch:

After Wage first year split, in left branch (<=X), use COLA as the second feature; in right branch (>X), use pension contributions as the second feature.

That could make sense because for lower wage increases, COLA becomes more important to offset costs, whereas for higher wages, additional benefits like pension might tip it into a good outcome.

So let's try:

Root: Wage increase first year <=5

Left (<=5): split on COLA:
    If COLA is total compensation adjustment: Good
    Else: Bad

Right (>5): split on Pension contribution:
    If full: Good
    Else: Bad

Alternatively, use more optimal splits based on data distribution. But since I don't have actual data, I'm making educated guesses.

I think this structure makes sense because it addresses both immediate financial gains (wage) and broader compensation factors (COLA and pension).

So the decision tree would look like:

|--- wage increase first year <=5
||--- cost of living adjustment: total compensation
||||--- class: good
||--- else
||||--- class: bad
|--- else
||--- employer contributions to pension plan: full
||||--- class: good
||--- else
||||--- class: bad

Wait, but the user's previous example had two splits after root. So following that structure:

Decision Tree:
|--- wage increase first year of contract <=5
||--- cost of living adjustment == 'total compensation adjustment'
||||--- class: good
||--- else
||||--- class: bad
|--- else
||--- employer contributions to pension plan == 'full'
||||--- class: good
||--- else
||||--- class: bad

I think that's a reasonable approach. It uses the most impactful features first, addressing immediate and broader financial aspects.
</think>

To determine whether labor negotiations are good or bad based on the given features with a maximum decision tree depth of 2, we prioritize the most influential factors. The decision tree is structured as follows:

Decision Tree:
|--- wage increase in first year of contract <=5
||--- cost of living adjustment == 'total compensation adjustment'
||||--- class: good
||--- else
||||--- class: bad
|--- else
||--- employer contributions to pension plan == 'full'
||||--- class: good
||--- else
||||--- class: bad

This tree first splits on the wage increase in the first year, considering immediate financial benefits. For lower wage increases, it further evaluates the cost of living adjustment's comprehensiveness. For higher wages, it assesses pension contributions to determine the negotiation outcome.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to create a Python function that predicts whether labor negotiations are good or bad based on certain features. The decision tree provided earlier splits the data first by the wage increase in the first year of the contract and then by the cost of living adjustment if the wage increase is below a threshold.

First, I need to map this logic into a Python function. The function should take a dictionary of features as input and return both the prediction (0 for bad, 1 for good) and a list of boolean values representing whether each inner node condition was met.

I see that in the example provided, the function uses specific thresholds like HbA1c_level <=6.7 and blood_glucose_level <=210. So I need to define similar meaningful thresholds for my features based on the given ranges.

Looking at the "wage increase first year" feature, it ranges from 2.0 to 7.0. The decision tree splits this into <=5 and >5. That makes sense because 5 is a midpoint in the range, providing a clear division between lower and higher wage increases.

Next, for the "cost of living adjustment," the possible values are 'none,' 'tcf' (temporary cost of living adjustment formula), and 'tc' (total compensation adjustment). The decision tree checks if it's equal to 'total compensation adjustment.' So in the function, I'll need to compare against this exact string.

I also notice that the example uses a list called "nodes" where each index corresponds to an inner node condition. In my case, since the maximum depth is 2, there will be two conditions: one for the wage increase and another for the cost of living adjustment.

I'll start by initializing the nodes list with None or boolean values indicating whether each condition was met. For node 0, I check if "wage increase first year" <=5, and for node 1, I check if "cost of living adjustment" equals 'tc'.

Then, based on these conditions, I determine the prediction. If wage increase is <=5 and cost of living adjustment is 'tc,' it's a good outcome (1). Otherwise, within that branch, it's bad (0). If wage increase >5, then I check if pension contributions are full for a good outcome.

Wait, in the original decision tree, after checking wage increase first year >5, it checks "employer contributions to pension plan" == 'full.' So actually, my function needs to include that as well. Oh, but in my initial mapping, I only considered two nodes. Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust to include both conditions correctly.

Let me reorganize the logic:

1. First condition: if wage increase first year <=5
   a. If true, check cost of living adjustment == 'tc' for prediction.
2. Else (wage increase >5)
   b. Check pension == 'full'

So I need to capture both conditions in the nodes list appropriately.

I think I'll structure it like:

- node[0] = wage_increase_first_year <=5
- if node[0], then node[1] = cost_of_living_adjustment == 'tc'
- else, check pension

Wait, but according to the example, each inner node is represented in the list. So maybe I need two nodes: one for the first split and another for the second split under the first condition.

So, in code:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [None, None]
    
    # First node: wage increase <=5
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <=5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Second node: cost of living adjustment == 'tc'
        nodes[1] = (X["cost of living adjustment"] == 'tc')
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        # Check pension contributions
        if X["pension"] == 'full':
            prediction =1
        else:
            prediction =0
    
    return prediction, [nodes[0], nodes[1]]

Wait, but in this setup, the second node is only evaluated if the first condition is true. So for cases where wage increase >5, nodes[1] remains None, which might not be desired.

To accurately represent both inner nodes regardless of the path taken, I should evaluate them separately and store their boolean values.

Let me adjust:

nodes = [
    X["wage increase first year"] <=5,
    (X["cost of living adjustment"]=="tc") if (X["wage increase first year"]<=5) else False
]

But this might not capture the pension condition correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should structure it to always evaluate both conditions.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to represent each inner node condition as separate checks and store their results in the nodes list regardless of the path taken.

So:

nodes = []
node0 = X["wage increase first year"] <=5
nodes.append(node0)

if node0:
    node1 = (X["cost of living adjustment"]=="tc")
else:
    # If not, node1 is irrelevant, set to False or None?
    node1 = False

But this still leaves the pension condition separate. I think perhaps in a decision tree with max depth 2, there are two splits: first on wage increase, then depending on that, either cost of living adjustment or pension.

So for the nodes list, it should capture both conditions as they represent inner node splits.

Therefore, to accurately reflect this:

nodes = [node0, node1]

Where:
- node0 is wage increase <=5
- node1 is either cost of living == 'tc' if node0 is true, else pension == 'full'

Wait, but that's mixing two different features in node1 based on the path. Perhaps it's better to have separate nodes for each condition.

Alternatively, perhaps I should structure it so that node0 is wage increase <=5 and node1 is cost of living == 'tc', regardless of node0.

But then, when node0 is false, node1 isn't used but still needs a value.

I think the example provided uses two inner nodes, each corresponding to their specific conditions. So in my case, I'll have:

node0: wage increase first year <=5
node1: cost of living adjustment == 'tc'

And based on these, determine the prediction.

But wait, when node0 is true, we use node1; else, we check pension.

So perhaps the nodes list should represent all inner nodes evaluated during the path taken. Therefore:

nodes = []
node0 = X["wage increase first year"] <=5
nodes.append(node0)

if node0:
    node1 = (X["cost of living adjustment"]=="tc")
    nodes.append(node1)
else:
    # For cases where node0 is false, we don't have a second inner node condition; perhaps set to None or False
    node1 = False
    nodes.append(node1)

But I'm not sure if this aligns with the example's structure.

Alternatively, in the function, always evaluate both conditions and store their boolean values:

nodes = [
    X["wage increase first year"] <=5,
    (X["cost of living adjustment"]=="tc")
]

Then, during prediction logic:

if nodes[0]:
    if nodes[1]:
        prediction=1
    else:
        prediction=0
else:
    # Check pension
    if X["pension"]=="full":
        prediction=1
    else:
        prediction=0

But this approach captures both inner node conditions as separate checks, which might be more accurate.

I think this is a better way to structure it, ensuring that all relevant inner nodes are represented in the list regardless of the path taken. So the function would evaluate and store both conditions.

Therefore, the final function should:

1. Check if wage increase first year <=5 → node0
2. Check if cost of living adjustment == 'tc' → node1

Then use these to determine prediction.
</think>

To predict whether labor negotiations are good (1) or bad (0), we will create a Python function that evaluates two key features: the wage increase in the first year and the cost of living adjustment. The decision tree splits first on the wage increase, then checks the cost of living adjustment if the wage increase is below the threshold.

### Approach
1. **Feature Selection**: We use "wage increase first year" and "cost of living adjustment" as the primary features for splitting nodes.
2. **Threshold Determination**: The wage increase in the first year is split at <=5, which is a midpoint in its range (2.0 to 7.0). The cost of living adjustment checks if it equals 'tc' (total compensation).
3. **Decision Logic**:
   - If "wage increase first year" >5, check if "pension" contributions are full for a good outcome.
4. **Nodes Representation**: Each inner node condition is stored in a list to represent the decision path.

### Solution Code
```python
def predict(X: dict) -> tuple[int, list[bool | None]]:
    # Initialize nodes with None (not evaluated)
    nodes = [None, None]
    
    # First condition: wage increase first year <=5
    node0 = X["wage increase first year"] <= 5
    nodes[0] = node0
    
    if node0:
        # Second condition under node0: cost of living adjustment == 'tc'
        node1 = (X["cost of living adjustment"] == 'tc')
        nodes[1] = node1
        
        if node1:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        # Check pension contributions for the other branch
        if X["pension"] == 'full':
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation
- **Node Evaluation**: The function first evaluates whether the wage increase in the first year is <=5. This condition is stored in `node0`.
- **Second Condition Check**: If `node0` is true, it then checks if the cost of living adjustment equals 'tc' and stores this in `node1`. Based on these two conditions, it predicts the outcome.
- **Alternative Path**: If `node0` is false (wage increase >5), the function checks pension contributions to determine the prediction.

This approach ensures that all relevant inner node conditions are evaluated and stored, providing a clear decision path for each prediction.
