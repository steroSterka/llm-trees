Alright, so I need to build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 using the given features to predict whether labor negotiations are good or bad. Let me start by understanding what each feature represents and how they might impact the outcome.

First, looking at the list of features:

1. Duration of agreement (1-7 years)
2. Wage increase in first year (2-7%)
3. Wage increase in second year (2-7%)
4. Wage increase in third year (2-7%)
5. Cost of living adjustment (none, temporary, total)
6. Number of working hours during the week (35-40)
7. Employer contributions to pension plan (none, retirement allowance, employee contribution)
8. Standby pay (2-25)
9. Shift differential supplement (1-25)
10. Education allowance (yes/no)
11. Number of statutory holidays (9-15)
12. Paid vacation days (below average/average/generous)
13. Employer help during long-term disability (yes/no)
14. Dental plan contribution (none/half/full)
15. Bereavement cost contribution (yes/no)
16. Health plan contribution (none/half/full)

I need to determine which two features are most important for determining a good or bad outcome.

Thinking about labor negotiations, the primary concerns usually revolve around financial benefits and work-life balance. So wage increases over the contract term would be critical, as they directly affect employees' immediate finances. Also, cost of living adjustments (COLA) are important because they protect against inflation, which is a significant factor for long-term financial stability.

Looking at other features like pension contributions, health plans, vacation days, etc., these are also important but might be secondary to direct wage increases and COLA. However, since I can only choose two features for a max depth of 2 tree, I should prioritize the most impactful ones.

I think the first split should be based on the average of the three wage increases because it directly reflects the financial gain over the contract's term. The second split could then be on the COLA type because having a total compensation adjustment would provide more security than just temporary or none.

So, the root node will check if the average wage increase is above a certain threshold. If it is, the outcome is likely good. If not, we'll check the COLA to see if it's total, which might still make the outcome good despite lower wage increases.

I need to decide on the thresholds. Since wages range from 2-7%, an average of 4.5% seems reasonable. For COLA, having a total adjustment is better than temporary or none.

Putting this together, the decision tree will first check if the average wage increase is above 4.5%. If yes, it's a good outcome. If not, it checks if COLA is total; if so, still good. Otherwise, bad.

I should make sure that this makes sense logically and covers all possible cases without overcomplicating things since the tree can't be deeper than two levels.

To classify whether the labor negotiations are good or bad based on the provided features, we'll construct a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. The tree will use the most important features to make classifications.

### Decision Tree:
|--- Average wage increase over three years > 4.5%  
||--- class: Good  
|--- Average wage increase over three years <= 4.5%  
||--- Cost of living adjustment == Total compensation adjustment  
||||--- class: Good  
||--- Cost of living adjustment != Total compensation adjustment  
||||--- class: Bad  

### Explanation:
1. **Root Node**: The tree starts by evaluating the average wage increase over the three years of the contract. If the average is greater than 4.5%, it directly leads to a "Good" outcome.
2. **Second Level (Left Child)**: If the average wage increase is 4.5% or less, the tree then examines the type of cost of living adjustment. A total compensation adjustment indicates a more favorable outcome, hence classified as "Good."
3. **Second Level (Right Child)**: If the cost of living adjustment is not a total compensation adjustment, the outcome is determined to be "Bad."

This structure ensures that the decision tree is both simple and effective in classifying negotiation outcomes based on key financial factors.

<think>
Okay, so I need to create a Python function based on the decision tree that was previously described for classifying labor negotiations as good or bad. The function should take a dictionary of features and return both a prediction (0 for bad, 1 for good) and a list of truth values representing the conditions evaluated in the inner nodes of the decision tree.

First, let's recall the structure of the decision tree we're dealing with:

```
|--- Average wage increase over three years > 4.5%
||--- class: Good
|--- Average wage increase over three years <= 4.5%
||--- Cost of living adjustment == Total compensation adjustment
||||--- class: Good
||--- Cost of living adjustment != Total compensation adjustment
||||--- class: Bad
```

So, the root node checks if the average wage increase over three years is greater than 4.5%. If it is, the prediction is 'Good'. If not, we move to the next condition regarding the cost of living adjustment.

Now, I need to map this logic into Python code. The input will be a dictionary `X` containing all the feature values with specific keys as provided. The function needs to compute two main things:

1. Compute the average wage increase over three years.
2. Evaluate the conditions based on this average and the cost of living adjustment.

Let's break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the Average Wage Increase**

The features related to wage increases are:
- 'wage increase first year'
- 'wage increase second year'
- 'wage increase third year'

These values range from 2.0 to 7.0, and they represent percentages. To find the average, I'll sum these three values and divide by 3.

**Step 2: Evaluate the Root Condition**

The root condition is whether this average wage increase is greater than 4.5%. So:

```
average_wage_increase = (X['wage increase first year'] + X['wage increase second year'] + X['wage increase third year']) / 3
condition1 = average_wage_increase > 4.5
```

If `condition1` is True, the prediction is 'Good' (1).

**Step 3: Evaluate the Second-Level Condition**

If `condition1` is False, we need to check the cost of living adjustment:

The feature for this is:
- 'cost of living adjustment'

Its possible values are: 'none', 'tcf', 'tc'. According to the decision tree, if it's equal to 'Total compensation adjustment', which I believe corresponds to 'tc' in the provided keys, then we classify as 'Good'.

So:

```
condition2 = (X['cost of living adjustment'] == 'tc')
```

If `condition2` is True and `condition1` is False, prediction is 'Good' (1). Otherwise, it's 'Bad' (0).

**Step 4: Constructing the Nodes List**

The nodes list should have two elements corresponding to the two conditions evaluated:

- `nodes[0]` corresponds to `condition1`
- `nodes[1]` corresponds to `condition2`

Each element is a boolean (True/False) indicating whether the condition was met.

**Step 5: Handling Data Types and Possible Errors**

I need to ensure that the function handles different data types appropriately. For example, 'cost of living adjustment' might be a string, so comparing it strictly to 'tc' should work as long as the input dictionary provides exactly those strings.

Also, I'll assume that all necessary keys are present in the input dictionary `X`. If any key is missing or if there's a type mismatch, the function might throw an error. For robustness, maybe adding checks would be good, but since it's not specified, I'll proceed without them for simplicity.

**Step 6: Putting It All Together**

Now, let's write the Python function incorporating all these steps.
</think>

```python
def predict(X):
    # Calculate average wage increase over three years
    avg_wage_increase = (X['wage increase first year'] + X['wage increase second year'] + X['wage increase third year']) / 3
    
    # Evaluate conditions for the decision tree nodes
    condition1 = avg_wage_increase > 4.5
    condition2 = (X['cost of living adjustment'] == 'tc')
    
    nodes = [condition1, condition2]
    
    if condition1:
        prediction = 1  # Good
    else:
        if condition2:
            prediction = 1  # Good
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Bad
    
    # Convert boolean values to integers for the nodes list
    nodes_int = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes_int
```

**Explanation:**

- **Step 1:** The function calculates the average wage increase over three years by summing the values of 'wage increase first year', 'wage increase second year', and 'wage increase third year', then dividing by 3.
  
- **Step 2:** It evaluates whether this average is greater than 4.5% (`condition1`).

- **Step 3:** If `condition1` is not met, it checks if the 'cost of living adjustment' is set to 'tc' (`condition2`).

- **Step 4:** The conditions are stored in a list called `nodes`, which is then converted to integers (1 for True, 0 for False) to match the required output format.

- **Step 5:** Based on these conditions, the function determines the prediction. If either condition is met, it predicts 'Good' (1); otherwise, it predicts 'Bad' (0).

This function effectively encapsulates the decision tree logic, providing both a classification and insight into which conditions were satisfied during the evaluation process.
