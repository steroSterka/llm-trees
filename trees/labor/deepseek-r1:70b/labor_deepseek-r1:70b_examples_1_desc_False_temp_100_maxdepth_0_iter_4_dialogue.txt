Alright, so I need to build a decision tree classifier using the provided features to predict whether labor negotiation outcomes are good or bad. Let me start by understanding the problem and the features available.

First, looking at the example given with the Iris dataset, it seems that the decision tree was built by selecting the most important feature first—in this case, petal width—and then further splitting based on other features like petal length. The goal is to classify the species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on these features.

Now, applying this to labor negotiations, I need to determine which features are most indicative of a good or bad outcome. Good outcomes in labor negotiations might mean better wages, more benefits, favorable working conditions, etc., while bad outcomes could be the opposite.

Looking at the features provided:

1. Duration of agreement (1 to 7 years)
2. Wage increase in each of the three contract years (scales from 2 to 7)
3. Cost of living adjustment (three options: none, temporary formula, total compensation)
4. Number of working hours per week (35-40)
5. Employer pension contributions (none, retirement allowance, employee contribution)
6. Standby pay (scale 2-25)
7. Shift differential for shifts 2 and 3 (1-25)
8. Education allowance (yes/no)
9. Number of statutory holidays (9-15 days)
10. Paid vacation days (below average, average, generous)
11. Employer help during long-term disability (yes/no)
12. Dental plan contributions (none, half, full)
13. Bereavement cost coverage (yes/no)
14. Health plan contributions (none, half, full)

I need to determine which of these features are most important for predicting the outcome.

First thought: Wage increases are likely a critical factor. If wage increases in each year are higher, it's more likely the outcome is good. Similarly, cost of living adjustments and pension contributions could be significant because they directly impact employees' financial stability.

Number of working hours might also be important; shorter hours (like 35) could indicate better work-life balance, contributing to a good outcome.

Paid vacation days being generous would likely lean towards a good outcome as well. Similarly, employer contributions to health and dental plans are benefits that would make an agreement favorable.

Standby pay and shift differentials might also play roles, especially in industries where shifts or standby time is common. Higher values here could mean better compensation for less desirable work conditions, leading to a good outcome.

Let me try to rank these features by importance:

1. Wage increases (all three years)
2. Cost of living adjustment
3. Pension contributions
4. Paid vacation days
5. Working hours
6. Health plan contributions
7. Dental plan contributions
8. Standby pay and shift differential
9. Education allowance, holidays, bereavement coverage, disability help

I think wage increases are the most straightforward indicator of a good outcome because higher increases directly benefit employees financially.

So, I'll start by considering the first-year wage increase as the root node. If it's high (say above a certain threshold), the outcome is likely good. Otherwise, we look at the second feature, perhaps the cost of living adjustment or pension contributions.

Wait, but in the Iris example, they used one feature and then split on another. Maybe I should choose the most significant single feature first.

Alternatively, considering that wage increases over three years might be more indicative together than individually. But since each is a separate feature, it's better to consider them individually or as an aggregate.

Perhaps I'll start with the average of the three wage increases or take the sum. Alternatively, I can use the highest among them.

But since in the example, they used a single feature (petal width), maybe I should do the same here. Let me think which single feature is most indicative.

I think the first-year wage increase might set the tone for the agreement. If it's high, employees are likely more satisfied. Alternatively, cost of living adjustments could be very important because they directly tie wages to inflation or cost increases, which is a significant factor.

But perhaps combining multiple features isn't necessary if one strong feature can split the data effectively.

Alternatively, maybe the duration of the agreement is less important than the content. So I'll focus on the wage-related and benefit-related features.

Let me try building the tree step by step:

1. First, check the first-year wage increase. If it's above a certain threshold (say 5 on the scale), outcome is good.
2. If not, then look at the cost of living adjustment. If it's 'total compensation,' outcome is good; else, proceed.
3. Next, consider pension contributions. If employer contributes more (e.g., retirement allowance or full contribution), it's good.
4. Then check paid vacation days—generous means good.
5. Finally, if none of these meet the good criteria, check standby pay and shift differential as additional benefits.

Wait, but perhaps I should structure it differently. Maybe start with cost of living adjustment because that directly affects wage value over time. Or maybe first-year wage increase is more immediate.

Alternatively, considering that higher wage increases in all three years indicate a better agreement, perhaps using the average or sum.

But to keep it simple and similar to the example, I'll choose one feature at each split.

Let me outline possible splits:

Root: First-year wage increase > threshold -> Good

Else,

Check cost of living adjustment. If total compensation adjustment -> Good

Else,

Check pension contributions. If employer contributes (retirement allowance or employee contribution? Wait, need to clarify the options.)

Wait, the pension contributions are: none / retirement allowance included / employee contribution.

Hmm, 'employee contribution' might mean that the employer doesn't contribute, so if it's 'retirement allowance,' that's better than none. So perhaps:

If pension is 'retirement allowance' -> Good

Else,

Check paid vacation days. If generous -> Good

Else,

Check standby pay and shift differential. If they are above a certain value -> Good

Otherwise, Bad.

Alternatively, maybe the structure could be:

First split: wage increase first year > 5 (assuming scale is 2-7, so 5 is mid)

If yes -> Good

If no,

Second split: cost of living adjustment == 'total compensation'

If yes -> Good

Else,

Third split: pension contributions == 'retirement allowance'

If yes -> Good

Else,

Fourth split: paid vacation days == 'generous'

If yes -> Good

Else,

Fifth split: standby pay + shift differential > X (say 20)

If yes -> Good

Else, Bad.

But I need to determine the thresholds. Let's assume that for wage increases, a higher value is better. So maybe if first-year wage increase is above 5 (scale 2-7), it's good.

Similarly, standby pay and shift differential are on scales up to 25; perhaps their sum being over 20 indicates good compensation for those aspects.

But I'm not sure about the exact thresholds. They might need to be determined based on data distribution.

Alternatively, another approach could be:

Root: wage increase first year > 5 -> Good

Else,

Check cost of living adjustment. If 'total compensation' -> Good

Else,

Check pension contributions. If employer contributes (retirement allowance) -> Good

Else,

Check paid vacation days. If generous -> Good

Else,

Check standby pay + shift differential > 20 -> Good

Else, Bad.

This seems logical because each subsequent split looks at the next most important feature if the previous one wasn't met.

Alternatively, perhaps pension contributions should come before cost of living adjustment, but I think cost of living is more directly tied to wage value over time.

Another consideration: standby pay and shift differential might be less critical than other benefits like health insurance. So maybe after checking pension, check health plan contributions (none, half, full). If it's 'full,' that's a good indicator.

So perhaps adjust the tree:

After pension, if health plan is 'full' -> Good

Else,

Check paid vacation days: generous -> Good

Then standby pay + shift differential >20.

But I think in the example, they only used a couple of features, so maybe it's better to keep it concise and use the top few most important ones.

In summary, my approach is:

1. Start with first-year wage increase as the root.
2. If high, outcome is good.
3. Else, check cost of living adjustment.
4. Then pension contributions.
5. Then paid vacation days.
6. Finally, standby and shift compensation.

Each step checks for a 'good' condition; if not met, it proceeds to the next feature.

To classify whether the outcome of labor negotiations is good or bad based on the given features, we can construct a decision tree that evaluates key factors in sequence. The tree starts with the most impactful features and progresses to less significant ones. Here's how the decision tree would look:

1. **First-Year Wage Increase**: 
   - If the wage increase in the first year is greater than 5 (on a scale from 2-7), classify the outcome as **Good**.
   
2. **Cost of Living Adjustment**:
   - If the first-year wage increase is 5 or less, check the cost of living adjustment. 
     - If it's "total compensation adjustment," classify as **Good**.

3. **Employer Pension Contributions**:
   - If the cost of living adjustment is not "total compensation," examine pension contributions.
     - If the employer contributes through a retirement allowance, classify as **Good**.

4. **Paid Vacation Days**:
   - If pension contributions are not favorable, check the number of paid vacation days.
     - If they are "generous," classify as **Good**.

5. **Standby Pay and Shift Differential**:
   - If vacation days are not generous, evaluate standby pay and shift differential combined.
     - If their sum exceeds 20 (on a scale up to 25 each), classify as **Good**.

6. **Default Classification**:
   - If none of the above conditions are met, classify the outcome as **Bad**.

This structured approach ensures that each subsequent check is only performed if the previous condition isn't satisfied, efficiently narrowing down the classification based on the most significant factors first.

Decision Tree:

|--- wage increase in first year of contract > 5  
||--- class: Good  
|--- wage increase in first year of contract <= 5  
||--- cost of living adjustment == "total compensation adjustment"  
||||--- class: Good  
|||--- cost of living adjustment != "total compensation adjustment"  
|||||--- employer contributions to pension plan == "retirement allowance included"  
||||||--- class: Good  
|||||||--- employer contributions to pension plan != "retirement allowance included"  
||||||||--- number of paid vacation days == "generous"  
|||||||||--- class: Good  
||||||||||--- number of paid vacation days != "generous"

Okay, I need to create a Python function that predicts whether the outcome of labor negotiations is good or bad based on a decision tree. The function should take a dictionary of features as input and return both the prediction (0 for bad, 1 for good) and a list of truth values representing the inner nodes of the decision tree.

First, I'll review the decision tree structure provided earlier. It starts with the wage increase in the first year. If it's greater than 5, the outcome is good. Otherwise, it checks the cost of living adjustment. If that's "total compensation adjustment," it's also good. Then, it looks at pension contributions and vacation days. Finally, if none of these conditions are met, it considers standby pay and shift differential.

I need to map this logic into Python code. I'll start by defining the function `predict` which takes a dictionary `X`. Inside the function, I'll initialize a list called `nodes` with five elements since there are four inner nodes in the tree, but I see that the example had five nodes, so I'll adjust accordingly.

Next, for each condition in the decision tree, I'll assign a boolean value to the corresponding index in `nodes`. For instance, the first node checks if 'wage increase first year' is greater than 5. The second node checks the cost of living adjustment against "total compensation adjustment." Similarly, I'll set up the other nodes based on pension contributions and vacation days.

After setting all the nodes, I'll structure the conditional statements to determine the prediction. Starting from the first condition, if it's true, predict 1 (good). If not, check the second node, and so on until the final condition regarding standby pay and shift differential.

I need to ensure that the keys in the dictionary match exactly as provided, including spaces and cases. Also, I'll handle the encoding correctly—for example, "total compensation adjustment" is abbreviated as "tc" according to the feature description, but wait, checking back, it says 'tcf' for temporary cost of living formula and 'tc' for total compensation adjustment. Wait, no—the user later provided a more detailed list where 'cost of living adjustment' has values: none, tcf (temporary), tc (total). So I should use "tc" to check against.

Wait, the feature description says:
- cost of living adjustment: [none, tcf, tc]

So in the function, when checking X['cost of living adjustment'], it's comparing to 'tc'.

Similarly, for pension contributions, the options are none, ret_allw (retirement allowance), empl_contr.

For vacation days, the options are ba (below average), avg, gnr (generous).

Now, I'll write each condition step by step. After assigning all nodes, I'll structure nested if-else statements to follow the decision tree flow and assign prediction accordingly.

Finally, after determining the prediction, I'll return it along with the list of node truth values converted to integers (1 for True, 0 for False).

I should also make sure that any division or conditions that involve numbers are correctly handled. For example, standby pay and shift differential summing up—since both can range from 2-25 each, their sum ranges from 4 to 50. The condition is if the sum exceeds 20.

Putting it all together, I'll write the function carefully, ensuring each step aligns with the decision tree structure.
</think>

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree logic for predicting labor negotiation outcomes:

```python
def predict(X: dict) -> tuple[int, list[int]]:
    # Initialize the nodes list to store truth values of inner nodes
    nodes = [None] * 5  # Adjusted to match the example's node count

    # Define each node condition based on features
    nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] > 5.0
    nodes[1] = (X['cost of living adjustment'] == 'tc')
    nodes[2] = (X['pension'] == 'ret_allw')
    nodes[3] = (X['vacation'] == 'gnr')
    nodes[4] = (X['standby pay'] + X['shift differential']) > 20

    # Determine the prediction based on node conditions
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1
                    else:
                        prediction = 0

    # Convert boolean nodes to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes_int = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes_int
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes Initialization:** The `nodes` list is initialized with five elements to capture the truth values of each inner node condition in the decision tree.

- **Condition Checks:** Each node corresponds to a specific feature check as per the decision tree:
  - Node 0 checks if the first-year wage increase exceeds 5.
  - Node 1 verifies if the cost of living adjustment is set to "tc" (total compensation).
  - Node 2 checks for retirement allowance in pension contributions.
  - Node 3 determines if vacation days are generous ('gnr').
  - Node 4 assesses whether the combined standby pay and shift differential exceed 20.

- **Prediction Logic:** The function uses nested conditional statements to traverse the decision tree, starting from the most significant feature (wage increase) down to the least. If any condition is met, it predicts a good outcome (1); otherwise, it defaults to bad (0).

- **Conversion to Integers:** Boolean values in `nodes` are converted to integers for clarity, where 1 represents True and 0 represents False.

This function efficiently classifies labor negotiation outcomes using the decision tree's hierarchical structure, ensuring each condition is evaluated in sequence until a prediction is reached.
