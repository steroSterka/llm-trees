Alright, so I need to build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 using the given features. The goal is to classify whether labor negotiations have a good or bad outcome.

First, let me list out all the features provided:

1. Duration of agreement (1 to 7)
2. Wage increase in first year of contract (2 to 7)
3. Wage increase in second year of contract (2 to 7)
4. Wage increase in third year of contract (2 to 7)
5. Cost of living adjustment (none / temporary formula / total compensation)
6. Number of working hours during week (35 to 40)
7. Employer contributions to pension plan (none / retirement allowance included / employee contribution)
8. Standby pay (2 to 25)
9. Shift differential: supplement for work on shifts 2 and 3 (1 to 25)
10. Education allowance (yes / no)
11. Number of statutory holidays (9 to 15)
12. Number of paid vacation days (below average / average / generous)
13. Employer's help during employee long-term disability (yes / no)
14. Employer's contribution towards the dental plan (none / half / full)
15. Employer's financial contribution towards bereavement costs (yes / no)
16. Employer's contribution towards the health plan (none / half / full)

Okay, that's a lot of features. Since I can only have a maximum depth of 2, I need to choose the two most important features.

I think about what makes labor negotiations good or bad. Typically, wage increases are crucial because they directly affect employees' financial well-being. So, maybe the first feature is one of the wage increase years.

Looking at the data, perhaps the third year's wage increase might be a significant indicator because it shows long-term commitment. Alternatively, the first year sets the tone. Maybe I should go with the average or total of all three years? But since each is separate, maybe selecting the most recent or the highest impact one.

Alternatively, cost of living adjustment is another important factor because it affects the real income. If there's a good cost of living adjustment, that might make negotiations better.

Also, the number of working hours is a key aspectâ€”fewer hours are generally better for work-life balance, so perhaps that's an important feature too.

But given I can only use two features, I need to pick the top two. Wage increase in the first year and cost of living adjustment might be the most significant because they directly impact current financial conditions.

Alternatively, maybe the number of paid vacation days is another strong indicator because it affects work-life balance and employee satisfaction.

Wait, but wage increases are more tangible benefits that employees might prioritize over other factors. So perhaps I'll choose "wage increase in first year" as the root node because immediate financial gains are critical.

Then for the second level, maybe cost of living adjustment to see how well the contract keeps up with inflation or living expenses.

Alternatively, standby pay or shift differential could be important, but I think those might be less impactful compared to wages and COLA.

So my initial thought is:

Root node: Wage increase in first year.

If it's high (say above a certain threshold), then outcome is good. If not, look at cost of living adjustment.

Wait, but maybe the second feature should be something that adds more value beyond just wage increases. For example, if wages are low but COLA is good, that might still be a good outcome.

Alternatively, if the first split is on COLA, which has three categories: none, temporary formula, total compensation. Maybe this can be a better initial split because it's categorical and could have clearer divisions.

But since I need to build a decision tree with maximum depth 2, perhaps using two features in a hierarchical way.

Let me consider the possible splits.

Option 1:

Root: Wage increase first year <= X

If yes -> good outcome

Else -> look at COLA:

   - If COLA is 'total compensation', then good
   - else if COLA is 'temporary formula' or 'none', bad

But I need to define what the thresholds are. Since wage increases range from 2-7, maybe a threshold of 5. So if first year's increase is >5, it's good.

If <=5, then check COLA: if total compensation adjustment, then good; else, bad.

Option 2:

Root: COLA

If 'total compensation' -> good outcome

Else, look at wage increase first year:

   If > threshold (say 5) -> good
   Else -> bad

This might be better because COLA being total compensation is a strong indicator of good negotiations.

Alternatively, perhaps combining both would yield better results. But since we can only use two features and max depth 2, I think Option 1 or 2 are feasible.

I think starting with COLA makes sense because it's a categorical variable that might have more distinct splits.

So:

Root node: Cost of living adjustment

If 'total compensation', outcome is good.

Else, look at wage increase first year. If > X (let's say 5), then good; else bad.

But I need to decide what the threshold for wage increase is. Maybe use the middle value or higher since it's from 2-7. Let's choose 5 as a reasonable cutoff.

Alternatively, if COLA is 'total compensation', regardless of wages, it's good because it ensures that employees' purchasing power is maintained.

If COLA is only temporary or none, then we look at the wage increase in the first year. If it's above a certain level (say 5), negotiations are still good; otherwise, bad.

So the tree would be:

|--- cost of living adjustment == 'total compensation adjustment' => class: good

|--- cost of living adjustment != 'total compensation adjustment'

     |--- wage increase in first year of contract > 5 => class: good

     |--- wage increase in first year of contract <= 5 => class: bad

Alternatively, I can structure it as:

Root: COLA.

If not total compensation, check wage increase. If high enough, still good; else bad.

I think this makes sense because COLA directly impacts the real income growth, and a total compensation adjustment is likely better for employees.

Therefore, the decision tree would first split on COLA being 'total compensation'. If yes, good outcome. Otherwise, it checks if the wage increase in the first year is above 5; if so, still good. Else, bad.

I think this structure captures two of the most impactful features and fits within a maximum depth of 2.
</think>

Here's the decision tree based on the thought process:

|--- cost of living adjustment == 'total compensation adjustment'  
|    |--- class: good  
|--- cost of living adjustment != 'total compensation adjustment'  
|    |--- wage increase in first year of contract > 5  
|    |    |--- class: good  
|    |--- wage increase in first year of contract <= 5  
|    |    |--- class: bad  

This tree prioritizes the cost of living adjustment as the primary feature, ensuring that if it's comprehensive ('total compensation'), negotiations are classified as good. If not, it then evaluates the wage increase in the first year to determine the outcome.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to create a Python function that predicts whether the outcome of labor negotiations is good or bad based on certain features and also returns the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.

First, I need to understand the structure of the decision tree we built earlier. It has a maximum depth of 2, which means there are two levels of conditions. The primary feature is 'cost of living adjustment', and if that's not 'total compensation adjustment', then we look at the 'wage increase first year'.

So, for the function `predict`, I'll need to take a dictionary `X` containing all the features as input. My goal is to evaluate each condition in order and return both the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of boolean values representing whether each node's condition was met.

I should start by initializing a list called `nodes` with two elements, since there are two inner nodes in the tree. Each element will be a boolean indicating whether that node's condition is satisfied.

The first condition checks if 'cost of living adjustment' is equal to 'total compensation'. If it is, then the prediction is good (1). So, I'll set `nodes[0]` to this condition and make the prediction 1. If not, we move to the second condition.

For the second condition, I need to check if 'wage increase first year' is greater than a certain threshold. Earlier, I used 5 as a placeholder, but looking back at the data ranges, it seems that using 5 makes sense since the wage increases range from 2.0 to 7.0. So, setting the threshold at 5 allows for a balanced evaluation.

If 'wage increase first year' is greater than 5, then the prediction is good (1); otherwise, it's bad (0). I'll set `nodes[1]` to this condition and assign the prediction accordingly.

It's important to ensure that all feature keys are correctly spelled as per the user's list. Any typo here could lead to errors in the function. Also, since some features have specific encodings or ranges, like 'cost of living adjustment' having ['none', 'tcf', 'tc'], I need to make sure that the condition checks for exact matches.

Once both conditions are evaluated and `nodes` is populated with booleans, the function will return the prediction as an integer (0 or 1) and the list of nodes converted to integers (1 for True, 0 for False).

I should also test this function with sample data to ensure it works correctly. For example, if 'cost of living adjustment' is 'tc', then regardless of other features, it should return a prediction of 1 with `nodes` being [1, None]. If not, and the first year wage increase is above 5, it should predict 1; otherwise, 0.

Finally, I'll write out the function step by step, making sure each part aligns with the decision tree logic and that all feature keys are correctly referenced.
</think>

Based on your request, here's a Python function that implements the decision tree you described. The function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features as input and returns both a prediction (0 for bad, 1 for good) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None, None]  # Two inner nodes in this tree
    
    # First condition: cost of living adjustment == 'total compensation'
    nodes[0] = (X['cost of living adjustment'] == 'tc')
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        # Second condition: wage increase first year > 5
        nodes[1] = (X['wage increase first year'] > 5)
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    
    # Convert the boolean values in nodes to integers for output
    nodes_int = [int(nodes[0]), int(nodes[1])]
    
    return prediction, nodes_int
```

### Explanation of the Function:

1. **Input:** The function takes a dictionary `X` containing all the features.

2. **Nodes List:** The list `nodes` is initialized to keep track of whether each inner node's condition is satisfied (True/False). Since the tree has a maximum depth of 2, there are two inner nodes.

3. **First Condition:** Checks if the "cost of living adjustment" feature is equal to 'tc' ('total compensation'). If true:
   - The prediction is set to 1 (good outcome).
   
4. **Second Condition:** If the first condition is false, it checks if the "wage increase first year" is greater than 5. If true:
   - The prediction is set to 1 (good outcome).
   - Otherwise, the prediction is set to 0 (bad outcome).

5. **Output:** The function returns a tuple containing the prediction and a list of integers representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input dictionary X
X = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 6,  # >5
    'wage increase second year': 4,
    'wage increase third year': 3,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'tc',  # Total compensation adjustment
    'working hours': 38,
    'pension': 'ret_allw',
    'standby pay': 10,
    'shift differential': 5,
    'education allowance': True,
    'statutory holidays': 12,
    'vacation': 'gnr',  # Generous
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'full',
    'bereavement assistance': True,
    'contribution to health plan': 'half'
}

# Make prediction and get node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Inner node conditions met: {nodes}")
```

This function aligns with the decision tree structure you provided while ensuring that the feature keys match exactly as specified.
