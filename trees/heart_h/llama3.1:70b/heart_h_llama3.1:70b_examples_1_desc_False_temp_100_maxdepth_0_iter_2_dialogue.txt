Based on the provided features, I will induce a decision tree classifier to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not. After analyzing the features, I have selected the most important ones to build the decision tree.

Here is the induced decision tree:

|--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) <= 140
||--- class: No heart disease
|--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) > 140
||--- Chest Pain Type == Typical angina
|||--- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest > 1
||||--- class: Heart disease
|||--- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest <= 1
||||--- class: No heart disease
||--- Chest Pain Type != Typical angina
|||--- Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy > 0
||||--- class: Heart disease
|||--- Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy == 0
||||--- Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg) > 120
|||||--- class: Heart disease
|||||--- Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg) <= 120
||||||--- class: No heart disease

The decision tree uses the following features:

1. Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm)
2. Chest Pain Type
3. ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest
4. Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
5. Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg)

These features are selected based on their importance in predicting heart disease, as determined by various studies and analyses.

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* If the maximum heart rate achieved is less than or equal to 140 bpm, the patient is likely to not have heart disease.
* If the maximum heart rate achieved is greater than 140 bpm, we consider the chest pain type. If it's typical angina, we look at the ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest. If it's greater than 1, the patient is likely to have heart disease.
* If the chest pain type is not typical angina, we consider the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy. If it's greater than 0, the patient is likely to have heart disease.
* If the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy is 0, we look at the resting blood pressure. If it's greater than 120 mmHg, the patient is likely to have heart disease.

Note that this decision tree is a simplified representation and may not capture all the complexities of predicting heart disease. In practice, more features and complex models may be used for accurate predictions.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) <= 140
    nodes[0] = X["thalach"] <= 140
    
    # Node 1: Chest Pain Type == Typical angina
    nodes[1] = X["chest_pain"] == 3
    
    # Node 2: ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest > 1
    nodes[2] = X["oldpeak"] > 1
    
    # Node 3: Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy > 0
    nodes[3] = X["ca"] > 0
    
    # Node 4: Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg) > 120
    nodes[4] = X["trestbps"] > 120

    if not nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
    else:
        prediction = 0
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values. It returns a tuple containing the predicted target variable value (1 if the patient has heart disease, 0 otherwise) and a list of truth values representing the inner nodes of the decision tree.

Note that I've used the exact spelling and case of the feature names as specified in your description. Also, I've assumed that the `target` variable is encoded as 1 for "yes" (patient has heart disease) and 0 for "no".
