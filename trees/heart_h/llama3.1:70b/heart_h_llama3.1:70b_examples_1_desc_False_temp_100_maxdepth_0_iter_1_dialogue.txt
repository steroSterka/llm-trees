Based on the provided features, I'll build a decision tree to classify whether a patient has heart disease or not. I'll use the most important features to construct the tree.

After analyzing the features, here's the induced decision tree:

|--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) <= 120
||--- class: No Heart Disease
|--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) > 120
||--- Chest Pain Type = Typical angina
|||--- class: Heart Disease
||--- Chest Pain Type != Typical angina
|||--- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest > 1
||||--- class: Heart Disease
||||--- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest <= 1
|||||--- Age (years) > 55
||||||--- class: Heart Disease
||||||--- Age (years) <= 55
|||||||--- class: No Heart Disease

Here's a brief explanation of the tree:

* The first split is based on the Maximum Heart Rate Achieved, which is a strong indicator of cardiovascular health. Patients with a maximum heart rate above 120 are more likely to have heart disease.
* For patients with a maximum heart rate above 120, the next split is based on Chest Pain Type. Those with typical angina are more likely to have heart disease.
* For patients without typical angina, the next split is based on ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest. Patients with significant ST depression (>1) are more likely to have heart disease.
* Finally, for patients with less severe ST depression (<= 1), the tree splits based on Age. Older patients (above 55) are more likely to have heart disease.

Note that this decision tree is not exhaustive and may not cover all possible scenarios. Additionally, the feature importances might vary depending on the specific dataset used to train the model.

Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree for heart disease classification:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) <= 120
    nodes[0] = X["thalach"] <= 120
    
    # Node 1: Chest Pain Type == Typical angina
    nodes[1] = X["chest_pain"] == 3
    
    # Node 2: ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest > 1
    nodes[2] = X["oldpeak"] > 1
    
    # Node 3: Age (years) > 55
    nodes[3] = X["age"] > 55
    
    if not nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        elif nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1
        elif nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
            
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values. The function returns a tuple containing the predicted target value (0 or 1) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Note that I've used integer values to represent the boolean values in the `nodes` list, where 1 corresponds to True and 0 corresponds to False.
