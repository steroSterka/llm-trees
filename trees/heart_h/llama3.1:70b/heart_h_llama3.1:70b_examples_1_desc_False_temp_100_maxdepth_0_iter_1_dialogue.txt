Based on the provided features, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not. Please note that this is a simplified example and may not reflect real-world complexity.

Here's the induced decision tree:

|--- Chest Pain Type = Typical angina
||--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved <= 120 bpm
|||--- class: No heart disease
||--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved > 120 bpm
|||--- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest >= 2
||||--- class: Heart disease
||||--- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest < 2
|||||--- class: No heart disease

|--- Chest Pain Type != Typical angina
||--- Age > 55 years
|||--- Serum Cholesterol > 240 mg/dl
||||--- class: Heart disease
||||--- Serum Cholesterol <= 240 mg/dl
|||||--- Resting Blood Pressure > 140 mmHg
||||||--- class: Heart disease
||||||--- Resting Blood Pressure <= 140 mmHg
|||||||--- class: No heart disease

The decision tree uses the following features in order of importance:

1. Chest Pain Type
2. Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
3. ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest
4. Age
5. Serum Cholesterol
6. Resting Blood Pressure

This tree suggests that patients with typical angina and a maximum heart rate achieved greater than 120 bpm are more likely to have heart disease, especially if they also exhibit significant ST depression during exercise.

For patients without typical angina, the tree considers age, serum cholesterol levels, and resting blood pressure. Patients over 55 years old with high serum cholesterol (>240 mg/dl) or elevated resting blood pressure (>140 mmHg) are more likely to have heart disease.

Keep in mind that this is a simplified example and real-world decision trees may involve more features and complex relationships.

Here is the Python function that represents the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Chest Pain Type == Typical angina
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 3
    
    # Node 1: Maximum Heart Rate Achieved <= 120 bpm
    nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 120
    
    # Node 2: ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest >= 2
    nodes[2] = X["oldpeak"] >= 2
    
    # Node 3: Age > 55 years (Threshold value, may need to adjust)
    nodes[3] = X.get("age", 0) > 55
    
    # Node 4: Serum Cholesterol > 200 mg/dl (Threshold value, may need to adjust)
    nodes[4] = X["chol"] > 200
    
    # Node 5: Fasting Blood Sugar == True
    nodes[5] = X["fbs"] == 2
    
    # Node 6: Exercise Induced Angina == Yes
    nodes[6] = X["exang"] == 2

    if nodes[0]:
        if not nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                if nodes[3] or nodes[4] or nodes[5] or nodes[6]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[3] or nodes[4] or nodes[5] or nodes[6]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    
    # Map the decision to the target variable (yes = 1, no = 0)
    prediction_map = {True: 1, False: 0}
    
    return prediction_map[prediction], nodes
```
Please note that you may need to adjust some of the threshold values used in this function according to your dataset. Also, the decision tree was simplified by considering only a subset of features and rules from the provided data description. This implementation assumes binary classification (yes/no) for heart disease diagnosis.

Also, make sure that all the keys used in this code (e.g., "chest_pain", "thalach", etc.) exactly match those in your input dictionary X.

You can use this function as follows:

```python
input_data = {
    "age": 60,
    "sex": 1,
    "cp": 3,
    "trestbps": 110,
    "chol": 240,
    "fbs": 0,
    "restecg": 0,
    "thalach": 160,
    "exang": 0,
    "oldpeak": 1.8,
    "slope": 2,
    "ca": 0,
    "thal": 3
}

prediction, nodes = predict(input_data)
print("Heart Disease Prediction:", prediction)
print("Decision Tree Nodes:", nodes)
```
