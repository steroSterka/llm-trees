Based on the provided features, I will build a decision tree to classify whether a patient has heart disease or not. Here's the induced decision tree:

|--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) <= 140
||--- Chest Pain Type == Non-anginal pain
|||--- class: No Heart Disease
||--- Chest Pain Type != Non-anginal pain
|||--- Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg) <= 130
||||--- class: No Heart Disease
||||--- Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg) > 130
|||||--- Serum Cholesterol (mg/dl) <= 240
||||||--- class: No Heart Disease
||||||--- Serum Cholesterol (mg/dl) > 240
|||||||--- class: Heart Disease
|--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) > 140
||--- Exercise Induced Angina == yes
|||--- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest >= 2
||||--- class: Heart Disease
||||--- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest < 2
|||||--- Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment == Downsloping
||||||--- class: Heart Disease
||||||--- Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment != Downsloping
|||||||--- class: No Heart Disease
||--- Exercise Induced Angina == no
|||--- Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy >= 1
||||--- class: Heart Disease
||||--- Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy < 1
|||||--- Thalassemia != Normal
||||||--- class: No Heart Disease
||||||--- Thalassemia == Normal
|||||||--- class: Heart Disease

This decision tree uses the following features in order of importance:

1. Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm)
2. Chest Pain Type
3. Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg)
4. Serum Cholesterol (mg/dl)
5. Exercise Induced Angina
6. ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest
7. Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment
8. Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
9. Thalassemia

Note that this is just one possible decision tree, and there may be other trees that are equally effective or more accurate.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 8 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["thalach"] <= 140
    nodes[1] = X["trestbps"] > 120
    nodes[2] = X["chol"] <= 200
    nodes[3] = X["oldpeak"] > 1.5
    nodes[4] = X["exang"] == 2
    nodes[5] = X["slope"] == 1
    nodes[6] = X["ca"] >= 2
    nodes[7] = X["thal"] != 2

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        elif nodes[4]:
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:
            if nodes[6]:
                prediction = 1
            elif nodes[7]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```
This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values as input and returns the predicted target value (`0` or `1`) along with the boolean values of the decision tree nodes. The node values are used to determine the predicted class label.

Note that I've assumed the encoding for the categorical features as follows:

* `sex`: 0 = female, 1 = male
* `chest_pain`: 3 = Typical angina, 0 = Asymptomatic, 2 = Non-anginal pain, 1 = Atypical angina
* `exang`: 1 = no, 2 = yes
* `slope`: 3 = Upsloping, 2 = Flat, 1 = Downsloping
* `thal`: 2 = Normal, 1 = Fixed defect, 3 = Reversible defect

Please adjust the encoding if it differs from your dataset.
