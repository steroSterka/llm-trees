I'll induce a decision tree classifier using the provided features. Please note that I'll use my discretion to select the most important features and create the tree.

After analyzing the features, I've decided to focus on the following key features:

1. Chest Pain Type
2. Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg)
3. Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm)
4. ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest

Here's the decision tree:
```
|--- Chest Pain Type = Asymptomatic
||--- class: No heart disease
|--- Chest Pain Type != Asymptomatic
||--- Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg) <= 120
|||--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) <= 150
||||--- class: No heart disease
|||--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) > 150
||||--- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest >= 2
|||||--- class: Heart disease
||||--- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest < 2
|||||--- class: No heart disease
||--- Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg) > 120
|||--- Chest Pain Type = Typical angina
||||--- class: Heart disease
|||--- Chest Pain Type != Typical angina
||||--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) <= 150
|||||--- class: No heart disease
||||--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) > 150
|||||--- class: Heart disease
```
This decision tree uses a combination of features to classify patients into two categories: "Heart disease" and "No heart disease". The tree starts by checking the Chest Pain Type, which is a strong indicator of heart disease. If the patient has asymptomatic chest pain, they are likely not to have heart disease.

For patients with non-asymptomatic chest pain, the tree checks their Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg). If it's below 120 mmHg, the tree checks their Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) and ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest. Patients with a high maximum heart rate or significant ST depression are more likely to have heart disease.

If the patient has a high resting blood pressure (> 120 mmHg), the tree re-checks the Chest Pain Type. If it's typical angina, the patient is likely to have heart disease. Otherwise, the tree checks their Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) again, and patients with a high maximum heart rate are more likely to have heart disease.

Please note that this decision tree is just one possible interpretation of the data and might not be optimal. In practice, you would want to validate this tree using techniques like cross-validation or by consulting with medical experts.

Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree for heart disease classification:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: chest_pain == Asymptomatic (0)
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0
    
    # Node 2: trestbps <= 120
    nodes[1] = X["trestbps"] <= 120
    
    # Node 3: thalach <= 150
    nodes[2] = X["thalach"] <= 150
    
    # Node 4: oldpeak >= 2
    nodes[3] = X["oldpeak"] >= 2
    
    # Node 5: chest_pain == Typical angina (3)
    nodes[4] = X["chest_pain"] == 3
    
    # Node 6: trestbps > 120 and thalach > 150
    nodes[5] = (X["trestbps"] > 120) and (X["thalach"] > 150)

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart disease
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # No heart disease
            else:
                if nodes[5]:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart disease
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
            else:
                if nodes[2]:
                    prediction = 0  # No heart disease
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart disease

    # Convert boolean values to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```
This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the patient's features and returns a tuple with two elements: the predicted target value (`prediction`) and a list of boolean values representing the inner nodes of the decision tree (`nodes`). The `nodes` list is then converted to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0) for easier interpretation.

You can use this function by creating a dictionary `X` with the patient's features and passing it as an argument:

```python
X = {
    "chest_pain": 2,
    "trestbps": 110,
    "thalach": 160,
    "oldpeak": 1.5,
    # ... other features ...
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```
