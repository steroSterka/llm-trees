I'll induce a decision tree classifier using the provided features. Please note that I'll use my discretion to select the most important features and create the tree.

After analyzing the features, I've decided to focus on the following key features:

1. Chest Pain Type
2. Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg)
3. Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm)
4. ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest

Here's the decision tree:
```
|--- Chest Pain Type = Asymptomatic
||--- class: No heart disease
|--- Chest Pain Type != Asymptomatic
||--- Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg) <= 120
|||--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) <= 150
||||--- class: No heart disease
|||--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) > 150
||||--- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest >= 2
|||||--- class: Heart disease
||||--- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest < 2
|||||--- class: No heart disease
||--- Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg) > 120
|||--- Chest Pain Type = Typical angina
||||--- class: Heart disease
|||--- Chest Pain Type != Typical angina
||||--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) <= 150
|||||--- class: No heart disease
||||--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) > 150
|||||--- class: Heart disease
```
This decision tree uses a combination of features to classify patients into two categories: "Heart disease" and "No heart disease". The tree starts by checking the Chest Pain Type, which is a strong indicator of heart disease. If the patient has asymptomatic chest pain, they are likely not to have heart disease.

For patients with non-asymptomatic chest pain, the tree checks their Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg). If it's below 120 mmHg, the tree checks their Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) and ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest. Patients with a high maximum heart rate or significant ST depression are more likely to have heart disease.

If the patient has a high resting blood pressure (> 120 mmHg), the tree re-checks the Chest Pain Type. If it's typical angina, the patient is likely to have heart disease. Otherwise, the tree checks their Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) again, and patients with a high maximum heart rate are more likely to have heart disease.

Please note that this decision tree is just one possible interpretation of the data and might not be optimal. In practice, you would want to validate this tree using techniques like cross-validation or by consulting with medical experts.
=======
Based on the provided features, I will build a decision tree to classify whether a patient has heart disease or not. Here's the induced decision tree:

|--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) <= 140
||--- Chest Pain Type == Non-anginal pain
|||--- class: No Heart Disease
||--- Chest Pain Type != Non-anginal pain
|||--- Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg) <= 130
||||--- class: No Heart Disease
||||--- Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg) > 130
|||||--- Serum Cholesterol (mg/dl) <= 240
||||||--- class: No Heart Disease
||||||--- Serum Cholesterol (mg/dl) > 240
|||||||--- class: Heart Disease
|--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) > 140
||--- Exercise Induced Angina == yes
|||--- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest >= 2
||||--- class: Heart Disease
||||--- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest < 2
|||||--- Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment == Downsloping
||||||--- class: Heart Disease
||||||--- Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment != Downsloping
|||||||--- class: No Heart Disease
||--- Exercise Induced Angina == no
|||--- Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy >= 1
||||--- class: Heart Disease
||||--- Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy < 1
|||||--- Thalassemia != Normal
||||||--- class: No Heart Disease
||||||--- Thalassemia == Normal
|||||||--- class: Heart Disease

This decision tree uses the following features in order of importance:

1. Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm)
2. Chest Pain Type
3. Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg)
4. Serum Cholesterol (mg/dl)
5. Exercise Induced Angina
6. ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest
7. Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment
8. Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
9. Thalassemia

Note that this is just one possible decision tree, and there may be other trees that are equally effective or more accurate.

Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree for heart disease classification:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: chest_pain == Asymptomatic (0)
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0
    
    # Node 2: trestbps <= 120
    nodes[1] = X["trestbps"] <= 120
    
    # Node 3: thalach <= 150
    nodes[2] = X["thalach"] <= 150
    
    # Node 4: oldpeak >= 2
    nodes[3] = X["oldpeak"] >= 2
    
    # Node 5: chest_pain == Typical angina (3)
    nodes[4] = X["chest_pain"] == 3
    
    # Node 6: trestbps > 120 and thalach > 150
    nodes[5] = (X["trestbps"] > 120) and (X["thalach"] > 150)

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart disease
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # No heart disease
            else:
                if nodes[5]:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart disease
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
            else:
                if nodes[2]:
                    prediction = 0  # No heart disease
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart disease

    # Convert boolean values to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```
This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the patient's features and returns a tuple with two elements: the predicted target value (`prediction`) and a list of boolean values representing the inner nodes of the decision tree (`nodes`). The `nodes` list is then converted to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0) for easier interpretation.

You can use this function by creating a dictionary `X` with the patient's features and passing it as an argument:

```python
X = {
    "chest_pain": 2,
    "trestbps": 110,
    "thalach": 160,
    "oldpeak": 1.5,
    # ... other features ...
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```
=======
Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 8 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["thalach"] <= 140
    nodes[1] = X["trestbps"] > 120
    nodes[2] = X["chol"] <= 200
    nodes[3] = X["oldpeak"] > 1.5
    nodes[4] = X["exang"] == 2
    nodes[5] = X["slope"] == 1
    nodes[6] = X["ca"] >= 2
    nodes[7] = X["thal"] != 2

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        elif nodes[4]:
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:
            if nodes[6]:
                prediction = 1
            elif nodes[7]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```
This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values as input and returns the predicted target value (`0` or `1`) along with the boolean values of the decision tree nodes. The node values are used to determine the predicted class label.

Note that I've assumed the encoding for the categorical features as follows:

* `sex`: 0 = female, 1 = male
* `chest_pain`: 3 = Typical angina, 0 = Asymptomatic, 2 = Non-anginal pain, 1 = Atypical angina
* `exang`: 1 = no, 2 = yes
* `slope`: 3 = Upsloping, 2 = Flat, 1 = Downsloping
* `thal`: 2 = Normal, 1 = Fixed defect, 3 = Reversible defect

Please adjust the encoding if it differs from your dataset.
