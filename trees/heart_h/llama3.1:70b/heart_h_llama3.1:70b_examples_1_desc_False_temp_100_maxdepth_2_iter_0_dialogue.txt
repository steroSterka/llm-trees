I'll build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 using the most important features. Since I don't have the actual data, I'll use my discretion to select the top features based on their relevance to heart disease.

After analyzing the features, I've selected the following top features:

1. **Chest Pain Type**: This feature is highly relevant to heart disease, as different types of chest pain can indicate various levels of risk.
2. **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm)**: A lower maximum heart rate achieved during exercise can be an indicator of heart disease.
3. **ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest**: ST depression is a significant indicator of ischemia, which can lead to heart disease.

Here's the decision tree:
```
|--- Chest Pain Type = Typical angina
||--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) <= 120
|||--- class: Has Heart Disease
||--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) > 120
|||--- class: No Heart Disease
|--- Chest Pain Type != Typical angina
||--- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest >= 2
|||--- class: Has Heart Disease
||--- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest < 2
|||--- class: No Heart Disease
```
This decision tree uses the Chest Pain Type as the primary feature to split the data. If the chest pain type is Typical angina, it further splits based on the Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm). If the maximum heart rate achieved is low (<= 120), it indicates a higher risk of heart disease.

If the chest pain type is not Typical angina, it splits based on the ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest. A value of 2 or more indicates a higher risk of ischemia and therefore heart disease.

Note that this decision tree is a simplified example and may not accurately represent the complex relationships between these features in real-world data. Additionally, other features like age, sex, and serum cholesterol levels can also be important indicators of heart disease, but are not included in this example due to the maximum depth constraint.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a patient has heart disease or not based on their characteristics.

    Args:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the patient's characteristics.
              The keys are: 'age', 'sex', 'chest_pain', 'trestbps', 'chol',
                           'fbs', 'restecg', 'thalach', 'exang', 'oldpeak',
                           'slope', 'ca', 'thal'

    Returns:
    prediction (int): 0 if the patient does not have heart disease, 1 otherwise
    nodes (list): A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Node 0: Is chest pain type typical angina?
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 3
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Is maximum heart rate achieved <= 160?
        nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 160
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        # Node 1: Is oldpeak value >= 2?
        nodes[1] = X["oldpeak"] >= 2
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, which contains the patient's characteristics. The keys in the dictionary are the same as those listed in your problem statement.

The function implements the decision tree by evaluating two inner nodes:

1. Node 0: Is chest pain type typical angina? (i.e., `chest_pain` == 3)
2. Node 1: Depending on the value of Node 0, either:
   * If chest pain type is typical angina, is maximum heart rate achieved <= 160?
     (i.e., `thalach` <= 160)
   * Otherwise, is oldpeak value >= 2?

The function then uses these node values to make a prediction about whether the patient has heart disease or not. The prediction and the node values are returned as output.

You can use this function like this:
```python
X = {
    'age': 55,
    'sex': 1,
    'chest_pain': 3,
    'trestbps': 140,
    'chol': 200,
    'fbs': 2,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 170,
    'exang': 2,
    'oldpeak': 1.5,
    'slope': 3,
    'ca': 0,
    'thal': 2
}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Node values:", nodes)
```
