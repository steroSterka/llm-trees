Based on the provided features, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not. Here's the tree:

|--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) <= 140
||--- class: No heart disease
|--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) > 140
||--- Chest Pain Type = Typical angina
|||--- Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg) <= 120
||||--- class: No heart disease
|||--- Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg) > 120
||||--- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest >= 2
|||||--- class: Heart disease
|||||--- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest < 2
||||||--- class: No heart disease
||--- Chest Pain Type != Typical angina
|||--- Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy > 0
||||--- class: Heart disease
|||--- Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy = 0
||||--- Age (years) <= 55
|||||--- class: No heart disease
|||||--- Age (years) > 55
||||||--- Sex = Male
|||||||--- class: Heart disease

This decision tree uses the following features:

1. Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm)
2. Chest Pain Type
3. Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg)
4. ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest
5. Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
6. Age (years)
7. Sex

The tree splits the data into two main branches based on the maximum heart rate achieved. If the patient's maximum heart rate is less than or equal to 140, they are classified as not having heart disease.

If the maximum heart rate is greater than 140, the tree further splits the data based on chest pain type. If the patient has typical angina, their resting blood pressure and ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest are considered. If these values indicate a high risk, the patient is classified as having heart disease.

For patients with non-typical angina or other types of chest pain, the tree considers the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy. If more than one vessel is affected, the patient is classified as having heart disease.

Finally, for patients with no significant vessel blockage, age and sex are considered. Older male patients are classified as having heart disease, while younger female patients or those without other risk factors are classified as not having heart disease.

Note that this decision tree is a simplified representation of the relationships between features and may not capture all complexities present in the data.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    
    # Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) <= 140
    nodes[0] = X["thalach"] <= 140
    
    # Chest Pain Type == Typical angina (3)
    nodes[1] = X["chest_pain"] == 3
    
    # Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg) > 120
    nodes[2] = X["trestbps"] > 120
    
    # ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest >= 2
    nodes[3] = X["oldpeak"] >= 2
    
    # Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy > 0
    nodes[4] = X["ca"] > 0
    
    # Age (years) <= 55
    nodes[5] = X["age"] <= 55
    
    # Sex == Male (1)
    nodes[6] = X["sex"] == 1

    if not nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1
            elif not nodes[5]:
                if nodes[6]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 0
                
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input and returns the predicted class label (0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease) along with a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.
