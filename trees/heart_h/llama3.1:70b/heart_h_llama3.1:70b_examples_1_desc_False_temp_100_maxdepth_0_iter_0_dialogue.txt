Based on the provided features, I will build a decision tree to classify whether a patient has heart disease or not. Here is the induced decision tree:

|--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) <= 149
||--- class: no heart disease
|--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) > 149
||--- Chest Pain Type = Typical angina
|||--- class: heart disease
||--- Chest Pain Type != Typical angina
||||--- Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg) <= 120
|||||--- class: no heart disease
||||--- Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg) > 120
|||||--- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest > 1
||||||--- class: heart disease
|||||--- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest <= 1
||||||--- class: no heart disease

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* The first split is based on Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm), which is a strong indicator of cardiovascular health. If the maximum heart rate is less than or equal to 149, the patient is likely not to have heart disease.
* If the maximum heart rate is greater than 149, we look at Chest Pain Type. Typical angina is a strong indicator of heart disease, so if the patient has typical angina, they are classified as having heart disease.
* If the patient does not have typical angina, we examine Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg). A resting blood pressure greater than 120 mmHg indicates potential cardiovascular issues. 
* Finally, if the patient's resting blood pressure is high, we look at ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest. This feature measures the degree of heart muscle ischemia during exercise. If this value is greater than 1, it indicates a higher risk of heart disease.

Note that this decision tree is not exhaustive and may not capture all possible scenarios or interactions between features. However, based on the provided features, this tree should provide a reasonable classification accuracy.

Here is the decision tree function in Python that predicts whether a patient has heart disease or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) <= 149
    nodes[0] = X["thalach"] <= 149
    
    # Node 1: Chest Pain Type == Typical angina
    nodes[1] = X["chest_pain"] == 3
    
    # Node 2: Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg) > 120
    nodes[2] = X["trestbps"] > 120
    
    # Node 3: ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest > 1.5
    nodes[3] = X["oldpeak"] > 1.5
    
    # Node 4: Serum Cholesterol (mg/dl) > 200
    nodes[4] = X["chol"] > 200

    if not nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    elif nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1
    elif nodes[2]:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        prediction = 0
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

You can call this function with a dictionary `X` that contains the patient's data. The function returns the predicted outcome (1 for heart disease, 0 for no heart disease) and a list of boolean values representing the state of each node in the decision tree.

Example usage:
```python
patient_data = {
    "thalach": 170,
    "chest_pain": 3,
    "trestbps": 140,
    "oldpeak": 2.5,
    "chol": 220
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(prediction)  # Output: 1 (heart disease predicted)
```
Note that the decision tree is based on the rules you provided earlier. The function uses these rules to make a prediction about whether the patient has heart disease or not.
