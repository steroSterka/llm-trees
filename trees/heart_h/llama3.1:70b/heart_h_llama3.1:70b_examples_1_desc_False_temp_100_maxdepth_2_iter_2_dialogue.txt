To build a decision tree for classifying whether a patient has heart disease or not, based on the provided features and with a maximum depth of 2, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Feature Selection**: Identify the most important features from the given set.
2. **Building the Decision Tree**: Use the selected features to construct the decision tree.

### Feature Selection

Given the complexity and the number of features, selecting the most relevant ones is crucial for an accurate model. However, without access to specific data or results from feature selection methods (like mutual information, correlation analysis, or recursive feature elimination), we'll rely on general medical knowledge and the nature of the features provided.

**Selected Features**:

1. **Chest Pain Type**: This can be a strong indicator of heart disease as different types of chest pain are associated with varying levels of cardiac risk.
2. **ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest**: Significant ST depression is often indicative of ischemia and thus could be a good predictor for heart disease.

### Building the Decision Tree

**Decision Tree (Maximum Depth = 2)**:

|--- Chest Pain Type in ("Typical angina", "Atypical angina")
||--- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest > 1
|||--- class: Heart Disease Present
||--- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest <= 1
|||--- class: No Heart Disease
|--- Chest Pain Type in ("Non-anginal pain", "Asymptomatic")
||--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved < 140
|||--- class: No Heart Disease (Assuming lower heart rate might indicate less stress on the heart, but this is a simplistic assumption without considering other factors like fitness level)
||--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved >= 140
|||--- class: Heart Disease Present

**Note**: This decision tree simplifies complex medical diagnostics into binary decisions. In reality, diagnosing heart disease involves more nuanced assessments and often requires additional testing (e.g., echocardiograms, stress tests, angiography) beyond the initial clinical evaluation.

### Limitations

1. **Oversimplification**: Heart disease diagnosis is complex and multifactorial.
2. **Lack of Data Analysis**: Without actual data, feature importance cannot be accurately determined.
3. **Depth Limitation**: A maximum depth of 2 might not fully capture the complexity of heart disease predictors.

In clinical practice, decision-making for diagnosing heart disease would involve a comprehensive evaluation considering all provided features and possibly more, along with patient history and additional diagnostic tests as needed.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree based on the provided features and target variable:


```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Node 0 checks if chest pain type is Typical angina or Atypical angina
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] in [3, 1]
    
    # Node 1 checks the ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest
    nodes[1] = X["oldpeak"] > 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        if X["thalach"] <= 120: # Additional check based on Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm)
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, which contains the feature values for a patient. It returns a tuple containing the predicted target value (`prediction`) and a list of boolean values representing the outcome of each node in the decision tree (`nodes`).
