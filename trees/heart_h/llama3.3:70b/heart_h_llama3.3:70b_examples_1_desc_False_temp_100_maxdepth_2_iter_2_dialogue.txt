Based on the provided features, I will induce a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 to classify whether a patient has heart disease or not. Here's the decision tree:

|--- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest > 1
    |--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) <= 150
        |--- class: Heart Disease (yes)
    |--- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) > 150
        |--- class: No Heart Disease (no)
|--- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest <= 1
    |--- Chest Pain Type = Typical angina
        |--- class: Heart Disease (yes)
    |--- Chest Pain Type != Typical angina
        |--- class: No Heart Disease (no)

The decision tree uses the following features:

1. ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest: This feature is used as the root node, as it has a strong correlation with heart disease.
2. Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm): This feature is used in the left subtree to further classify patients with high ST depression.
3. Chest Pain Type: This feature is used in the right subtree to classify patients with low ST depression.

Note that this decision tree is not optimized for accuracy and is based on a simple analysis of the provided features. In practice, you may want to use more advanced techniques, such as cross-validation and feature selection, to improve the performance of the classifier.

Also, note that the classes are labeled as "Heart Disease (yes)" and "No Heart Disease (no)", but in your original message, you mentioned that the tree should classify whether a patient has heart disease or not. I assume this means that the target variable is binary (0/1 or yes/no), where 1 or "yes" indicates the presence of heart disease.

Here's a Python code snippet using scikit-learn to induce the decision tree:
```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load your dataset into a Pandas dataframe (df)

X = df.drop(['target'], axis=1)  # features
y = df['target']  # target variable (0/1 or yes/no)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("Decision Tree:")
print(clf.tree_)
```
Make sure to replace `df` with your actual dataframe and adjust the code according to your specific needs.

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. The function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features as input and returns a tuple where the first element is the predicted target variable (`0` for no heart disease and `1` for heart disease) and the second element is a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a patient has heart disease or not based on their features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the features. The keys are 'age', 'sex', 'chest_pain', 
              'trestbps', 'chol', 'fbs', 'restecg', 'thalach', 'exang', 'oldpeak', 'slope', 
              'ca', and 'thal'.
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple where the first element is the predicted target variable (0 for no heart disease, 
           1 for heart disease) and the second element is a list representing the truth values of 
           the inner nodes.
    """
    
    # Define the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] > 1.5  # Node 1: ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest > 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 150 and X["chest_pain"] == 3  # Node 2: Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) <= 150 and Chest Pain Type is Typical angina
    
    # Make predictions based on the inner nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Patient has heart disease if ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest > 1.5
    elif nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1  # Patient has heart disease if Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm) <= 150 and Chest Pain Type is Typical angina
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Patient does not have heart disease otherwise
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function first defines the inner nodes based on the features. Then it makes predictions based on these nodes. If `oldpeak` is greater than 1.5, the patient has heart disease. Otherwise, if `thalach` is less than or equal to 150 and `chest_pain` is Typical angina (i.e., `chest_pain` equals 3), the patient also has heart disease. In all other cases, the patient does not have heart disease.

The function returns a tuple where the first element is the predicted target variable and the second element is a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The truth values are converted to integers (0 for False and 1 for True) before being returned.

Here's an example usage of this function:

```python
X = {
    "age": 60,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 3,  # Typical angina
    "trestbps": 120,
    "chol": 200,
    "fbs": 1,  # False
    "restecg": 2,  # Normal
    "thalach": 140,  # Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm)
    "exang": 2,  # Yes
    "oldpeak": 2.0,  # ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest
    "slope": 3,  # Upsloping
    "ca": 1,  # Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
    "thal": 2  # Normal
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```
