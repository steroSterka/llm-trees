To build a decision tree classifier for heart disease diagnosis based on the given features, we will follow these steps:

1. **Feature Selection**: Identify the most important features that contribute to the classification of heart disease.
2. **Tree Construction**: Construct the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 using the selected features.

Given the complexity and variety of the features provided, it's essential to note that without actual data (e.g., a dataset), we can't perform statistical analysis or feature selection using techniques like mutual information, correlation analysis, or recursive feature elimination. However, based on clinical knowledge and general understanding of cardiovascular health factors, we can hypothesize which features might be most relevant for diagnosing heart disease.

**Feature Selection Hypothesis**:
- **Age**: Older individuals are at a higher risk of heart disease.
- **Sex**: There's evidence to suggest differences in heart disease risk between males and females, with males generally being at higher risk at younger ages.
- **Chest Pain Type**: This can be indicative of the presence and type of heart disease.
- **Resting Blood Pressure**: High blood pressure is a significant risk factor for heart disease.
- **Serum Cholesterol**: High levels of certain types of cholesterol are associated with increased risk of heart disease.

**Decision Tree Construction**:
Given the maximum depth constraint of 2, our tree will have one root node and up to four leaf nodes. For simplicity, let's select "Age" as the first feature (root node) because it's a strong predictor for many health conditions, including heart disease. Then, we'll use "Chest Pain Type" as the second-level feature, considering its direct relation to symptoms of heart disease.

**Decision Tree**:
|--- Age <= 50
||--- Chest Pain Type: Typical angina / Atypical angina
|||--- class: Heart Disease Present
||--- Chest Pain Type: Non-anginal pain / Asymptomatic
|||--- class: Heart Disease Absent
|--- Age > 50
||--- Chest Pain Type: Typical angina / Atypical angina
|||--- class: Heart Disease Present
||--- Chest Pain Type: Non-anginal pain / Asymptomatic
|||--- class: Heart Disease Less Likely but Possible (consider further testing)

**Note**: This decision tree is a simplified example based on hypothetical feature selection and does not reflect real clinical guidelines or the complexity of diagnosing heart disease. Actual diagnosis involves comprehensive medical evaluation, including patient history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests.

In practice, building an accurate decision tree for heart disease diagnosis would require:
- Access to a detailed dataset containing patient information and outcomes.
- Application of feature selection techniques to identify the most predictive features.
- Possibly using more advanced machine learning models or ensemble methods that can handle complex interactions between multiple variables.

Here's how you could implement the decision tree as a Python function based on your description:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a patient has heart disease or not based on their features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the patient's features.
              Keys should include 'age', 'sex', 'chest_pain', etc.

    Returns:
    prediction (int): 1 if the patient has heart disease, 0 otherwise.
    nodes (list): A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
                  1 represents True and 0 represents False.
    """
    # Initialize nodes with None
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Define the first node based on age
    nodes[0] = X["age"] > 50

    # Define the second node based on chest pain type (Typical angina or Atypical angina)
    nodes[1] = X["chest_pain"] in [3, 1]

    # Make prediction based on nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease present
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Heart disease less likely but possible (consider further testing)
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease present
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Heart disease absent

    # Convert boolean nodes to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0) for output
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes


# Example usage:
patient_features = {
    "age": 55,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 3,  # Typical angina
    "trestbps": 120,
    "chol": 200,
    "fbs": 2,  # True
    "restecg": 2,  # Normal
    "thalach": 150,
    "exang": 2,  # Yes
    "oldpeak": 1.5,
    "slope": 3,  # Upsloping
    "ca": 1,
    "thal": 2,  # Normal
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This code defines a function `predict` that takes in a dictionary of patient features and returns a prediction (0 or 1) along with the truth values of the inner nodes. The first node checks if the patient's age is greater than 50, and the second node checks if the chest pain type is either Typical angina (3) or Atypical angina (1). The prediction is then made based on these two conditions. Finally, the function converts the boolean values of the nodes to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0) before returning them along with the prediction.
