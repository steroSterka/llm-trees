To build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 that classifies whether a patient has heart disease or not, we'll use the provided features. Given the complexity and variety of the features, we'll focus on the most relevant ones for heart disease diagnosis based on general medical knowledge.

1. **Age (years)**: Older age is associated with a higher risk of heart disease.
2. **Sex (male / female)**: Males are generally at higher risk than females.
3. **Chest Pain Type**: Indicates potential issues with the heart, with typical angina being more directly related to heart disease.
4. **Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg)** and **Serum Cholesterol (mg/dl)**: High values are associated with increased risk of heart disease.
5. **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm)**: Lower maximum heart rates during exercise can indicate poorer cardiovascular health.

However, to simplify the decision tree and focus on a maximum depth of 2, we'll prioritize features that directly indicate heart issues or risk factors commonly associated with heart disease in medical literature:

- **Chest Pain Type**: As it directly relates to symptoms that could indicate heart disease.
- **Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg)**: High blood pressure is a significant risk factor for heart disease.

Given these considerations, here's a simplified decision tree structure. Note that this is an illustrative example based on the provided features and general knowledge about factors contributing to heart disease. Actual diagnosis would require more detailed medical evaluation and potentially different features based on current research and clinical guidelines.

```
|--- Chest Pain Type == Typical angina
    |--- Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg) > 140
        |--- class: Heart Disease Present
    |--- Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg) <= 140
        |--- class: Heart Disease Absent or Less Likely

|--- Chest Pain Type != Typical angina
    |--- Chest Pain Type == Atypical angina / Non-anginal pain
        |--- Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg) > 160
            |--- class: Heart Disease Present
        |--- Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg) <= 160
            |--- class: Heart Disease Absent or Less Likely
    |--- Chest Pain Type == Asymptomatic
        |--- class: Heart Disease Absent or Less Likely
```

This decision tree attempts to classify patients based on their chest pain type and resting blood pressure, two critical factors in assessing heart disease risk. However, real-world diagnosis involves more complex evaluations, including additional tests (like stress tests, echocardiograms) and considering other risk factors (family history, smoking status, obesity, etc.), which are not included in the provided features.

**Important Note**: This is a simplified example for educational purposes and should not be used for actual medical diagnosis. Heart disease diagnosis involves comprehensive clinical evaluation and should only be performed by qualified healthcare professionals.

Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree based on the provided features and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a patient has heart disease or not based on their features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the patient's features.
            - age (int): Age in years.
            - sex (str): Sex of the patient (male, female).
            - chest_pain (int): Chest pain type (3 = Typical angina, 0 = Asymptomatic, 2 = Non-anginal pain, 1 = Atypical angina).
            - trestbps (int): Resting blood pressure in mmHg.
            - chol (int): Serum cholesterol in mg/dl.
            - fbs (int): Fasting blood sugar (1 = false, 2 = true).
            - restecg (int): Resting electrocardiographic results (2 = Normal, 3 = Having ST-T wave abnormality, 1 = Showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria).
            - thalach (int): Maximum heart rate achieved in bpm.
            - exang (int): Exercise induced angina (1 = no, 2 = yes).
            - oldpeak (float): ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (0 to 5).
            - slope (int): Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (3 = Upsloping, 2 = Flat, 1 = Downsloping).
            - ca (int): Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0, 1, 2, 3).
            - thal (int): Thalassemia (2 = Normal, 1 = Fixed defect, 3 = Reversible defect).

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of boolean values representing the inner nodes.
    """

    # Initialize the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Node 0: Chest pain type is Typical angina (3)
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 3

    # Node 1: Resting blood pressure is greater than 140 mmHg
    nodes[1] = X["trestbps"] > 140

    # Make the prediction based on the inner nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        # If chest pain type is Typical angina, check the resting blood pressure
        if nodes[1]:
            # If resting blood pressure is high, predict heart disease (1)
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # If resting blood pressure is not high, predict no heart disease (0)
            prediction = 0
    else:
        # If chest pain type is not Typical angina, predict no heart disease (0) unless the resting blood pressure is very high (> 160 mmHg)
        if X["trestbps"] > 160:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    # Convert the boolean values of the inner nodes to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

You can use this function by passing a dictionary containing the patient's features as an argument. The function returns a tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of integers representing the inner nodes.

Example usage:
```python
patient_features = {
    "age": 60,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 3,
    "trestbps": 150,
    "chol": 200,
    "fbs": 2,
    "restecg": 2,
    "thalach": 120,
    "exang": 2,
    "oldpeak": 1.5,
    "slope": 3,
    "ca": 2,
    "thal": 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Inner nodes:", nodes)
```
