To induce a decision tree classifier for predicting whether a patient has heart disease or not based on the provided features, we'll follow a general approach to selecting the most important features and structuring the tree. However, without actual data, we can't perform statistical analysis or use algorithms like CART (Classification and Regression Trees) directly. Instead, we'll rely on clinical knowledge and the nature of the variables to propose a decision tree structure.

Given the complexity and the mix of categorical and numerical variables, here's a simplified approach:

1. **Selecting Initial Features**: Clinically relevant features that are often associated with heart disease include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise, slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and thalassemia.

2. **Root Node**: Start with a feature that has strong clinical relevance to heart disease diagnosis. Age is a significant risk factor for heart disease, so it's reasonable to start with this.

3. **Decision Tree Structure**:
    - **Age (years)**: Given its significance as a risk factor, let's use age as our initial split.
        - For simplicity, let's assume the cut-off could be around 50 years old, though in practice, this would depend on the data distribution and clinical guidelines.
        
|--- Age <= 50
||--- Next feature to consider: Chest Pain Type. This is because chest pain type directly relates to symptoms of heart disease.
    - Typical angina is more indicative of heart disease than non-anginal pain or asymptomatic presentations.
        |--- Chest Pain Type == Typical angina
        |||--- class: Heart Disease Likely
        |--- Chest Pain Type != Typical angina
            - Next feature: Resting Blood Pressure. High blood pressure is a risk factor for heart disease.
                |--- Resting Blood Pressure > 130 mmHg (using a general guideline for hypertension)
                |||--- class: Heart Disease Possible
                |--- Resting Blood Pressure <= 130 mmHg
                    - Next feature: Serum Cholesterol. High cholesterol levels are associated with increased risk of heart disease.
                        |--- Serum Cholesterol > 200 mg/dl (using a general guideline for high cholesterol)
                        |||--- class: Heart Disease Possible
                        |--- Serum Cholesterol <= 200 mg/dl
                            - class: Heart Disease Unlikely

|--- Age > 50
    - At this age, the risk of heart disease increases, so we might be more inclined to classify based on fewer or less severe symptoms.
        - Next feature: Exercise Induced Angina. This is a direct indicator of ischemia during physical exertion.
            |--- Exercise Induced Angina == yes
            |||--- class: Heart Disease Likely
            |--- Exercise Induced Angina == no
                - Next feature: ST Depression Induced by Exercise. This indicates ischemia and potential heart disease.
                    |--- ST Depression > 1 (indicating some level of ischemia)
                    |||--- class: Heart Disease Possible
                    |--- ST Depression <= 1
                        - class: Heart Disease Unlikely

This decision tree is highly simplified and based on general clinical knowledge rather than specific data analysis. In practice, constructing an accurate decision tree would require analyzing a dataset containing these features and the corresponding heart disease status (positive or negative) for each patient. Techniques such as cross-validation would be used to evaluate the tree's performance and prevent overfitting.

Remember, this is a conceptual approach and real-world application requires actual data analysis, likely involving more complex decision-making processes and potentially the inclusion of additional features not listed here.

Here's how you could implement the decision tree in Python based on the provided features and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to store the truth values of inner nodes
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Age <= 50
    nodes[0] = X["age"] <= 50
    
    # If age is less than or equal to 50, consider chest pain type
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Chest Pain Type == Typical angina (3)
        nodes[1] = X["chest_pain"] == 3
        
        # If chest pain type is typical angina, predict heart disease likely
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # Consider resting blood pressure
            # Node 2: Resting Blood Pressure > 130 mmHg
            nodes[2] = X["trestbps"] > 130
            
            # If resting blood pressure is high, predict heart disease possible
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                # Consider serum cholesterol level
                # Node 3: Serum Cholesterol > 200 mg/dl
                nodes[3] = X["chol"] > 200
                
                # If serum cholesterol is high, predict heart disease possible
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    # Predict no heart disease
                    prediction = 0
                    
    # If age is greater than 50, consider exercise induced angina
    else:
        # Node 4: Exercise Induced Angina == yes (2)
        nodes[4] = X["exang"] == 2
        
        # If exercise induced angina is yes, predict heart disease likely
        if nodes[4]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # Consider ST depression induced by exercise
            # Node 5: ST Depression > 1
            nodes[5] = X["oldpeak"] > 1
            
            # If ST depression is high, predict heart disease possible
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                # Predict no heart disease
                prediction = 0
                
    # Node 6: Not used in this simplified example
    nodes[6] = None
    
    # Convert boolean values to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) if node is not None else 0 for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
example_input = {
    "age": 55,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 3,
    "trestbps": 140,
    "chol": 220,
    "fbs": 1,
    "restecg": 2,
    "thalach": 160,
    "exang": 2,
    "oldpeak": 2.5,
    "slope": 3,
    "ca": 2,
    "thal": 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_input)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Inner node truth values:", nodes)

This function implements a simplified decision tree based on the provided features and target variable. It uses age as the initial feature and then considers chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, exercise induced angina, and ST depression induced by exercise to make predictions about heart disease likelihood.

Please note that this is a simplified example, and in practice, you may need to consider more features, thresholds, and interactions between features to improve the accuracy of your decision tree. Additionally, this function assumes that the input dictionary contains all the necessary features with valid values. You may want to add error handling code to handle missing or invalid inputs.

In terms of feature encoding or ranges, here are some notes:
* `age`: Age in years (integer)
* `sex`: Sex ("male" or "female")
* `chest_pain`: Chest pain type (0 = Asymptomatic, 1 = Atypical angina, 2 = Non-anginal pain, 3 = Typical angina)
* `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure in mmHg (integer)
* `chol`: Serum cholesterol level in mg/dl (integer)
* `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar (1 = false, 2 = true)
* `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results (0 = Normal, 1 = Showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria, 2 = Having ST-T wave abnormality)
* `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved in bpm (integer)
* `exang`: Exercise induced angina (1 = no, 2 = yes)
* `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (0 to 5, float)
* `slope`: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1 = Downsloping, 2 = Flat, 3 = Upsloping)
* `ca`: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0, 1, 2, 3)
* `thal`: Thalassemia (1 = Fixed defect, 2 = Normal, 3 = Reversible defect)
