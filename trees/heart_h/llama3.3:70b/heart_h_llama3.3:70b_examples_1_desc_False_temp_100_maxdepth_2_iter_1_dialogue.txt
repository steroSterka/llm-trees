To build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 for predicting heart disease based on the provided features, we first need to identify the most important features. Since the actual importance of features can be determined through techniques like recursive feature elimination or by analyzing the dataset (which isn't directly provided here), I'll make an educated guess based on common medical knowledge about factors influencing heart disease.

1. **Age**: Generally, older individuals are at a higher risk for heart disease.
2. **Serum Cholesterol**: High levels of serum cholesterol are associated with increased risk of heart disease.
3. **Chest Pain Type**: Different types of chest pain can indicate different risks and types of cardiac issues.
4. **Resting Blood Pressure**: Hypertension is a known risk factor for heart disease.

Given these features, a simplified decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 could look like this:

- **Decision Node 1:** Age (years) <= 55
  - **Left Child (Age <= 55):**
    - **Decision Node 2:** Serum Cholesterol (mg/dl) <= 200
      - **Left Child (Serum Cholesterol <= 200):** Class: No Heart Disease
      - **Right Child (Serum Cholesterol > 200):** Class: Heart Disease
  - **Right Child (Age > 55):**
    - **Decision Node 2:** Chest Pain Type == Typical angina
      - **Left Child (Typical Angina):** Class: Heart Disease
      - **Right Child (Not Typical Angina):** Class: No Heart Disease

This simplified tree makes the following assumptions:
- Younger individuals (<= 55 years) with lower serum cholesterol levels are less likely to have heart disease.
- Older individuals (> 55 years) experiencing typical angina symptoms are more likely to have heart disease.

Please note, this is a highly simplified example and real-world decision trees would require analysis of actual data to determine the most predictive features and their thresholds. Additionally, clinical judgment and comprehensive evaluation of all relevant factors (including those not listed here) are essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning in medicine. 

Here's how you might implement such a tree using Python with Scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'data' is your DataFrame containing the features and target variable
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Age': [40, 50, 60, 70],
    'Serum Cholesterol': [180, 220, 200, 240],
    'Chest Pain Type': ['Atypical angina', 'Typical angina', 'Non-anginal pain', 'Typical angina'],
    # Other features...
    'Heart Disease': [0, 1, 0, 1]  # Target variable
})

# One-hot encoding for categorical variables (e.g., Chest Pain Type)
data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['Chest Pain Type'])

X = data.drop('Heart Disease', axis=1)  # Features
y = data['Heart Disease']  # Target variable

clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2)
clf.fit(X, y)

# Now you can use clf to predict heart disease for new patients
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to prepare your data and fit a decision tree classifier. Remember, the performance of such models heavily depends on the quality and quantity of the training data.

Here is a Python function representing the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 for predicting heart disease based on the provided features:

```python
def predict_heart_disease(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a patient has heart disease or not based on their features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing the patient's features.
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease)
           and a list of truth values representing the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    
    # Initialize the nodes with None
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Decision Node 1: Age
    nodes[0] = X["age"] <= 55
    
    # Decision Node 2: Serum Cholesterol
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["chol"] <= 200
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["chest_pain"] == 3  # Typical angina
    
    # Make the prediction based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease (typical angina)
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    
    # Convert the boolean values to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
patient_features = {
    "age": 60,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 3,
    "trestbps": 120,
    "chol": 220,
    "fbs": 1,
    "restecg": 2,
    "thalach": 150,
    "exang": 1,
    "oldpeak": 2,
    "slope": 3,
    "ca": 2,
    "thal": 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict_heart_disease(patient_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This function uses the age and serum cholesterol features to make predictions about heart disease. If the patient is younger than or equal to 55 years old, it checks their serum cholesterol level. If the patient is older than 55 years old, it checks for typical angina (chest pain type 3). The function returns a prediction (0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease) and a list of truth values representing the inner nodes of the decision tree.
