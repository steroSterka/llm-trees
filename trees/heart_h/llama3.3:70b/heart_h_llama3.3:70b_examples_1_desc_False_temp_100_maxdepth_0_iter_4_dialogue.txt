To induce a decision tree classifier for predicting whether a patient has heart disease or not based on the provided features, we'll follow a general approach since the actual data and the specific algorithm's output are not provided. The decision tree will be structured based on the importance of features typically considered in medical diagnoses related to heart disease.

Given the complexity and the number of features, the most critical step is determining which features are most predictive of heart disease. Typically, features like Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, Serum Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, Resting Electrocardiographic Results, Maximum Heart Rate Achieved, Exercise Induced Angina, ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest, Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment, Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy, and Thalassemia are directly related to cardiovascular health.

Here's a simplified example of how a decision tree might look, prioritizing features that are commonly associated with heart disease risk:

1. **Chest Pain Type**:
   - If **Typical angina**, proceed to evaluate the severity of symptoms and other risk factors.
   - If **Atypical angina** or **Non-anginal pain**, consider these as potential indicators of heart disease but less directly related than typical angina.
   - If **Asymptomatic**, the patient might still be at risk due to other factors like high blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.

2. **Serum Cholesterol (mg/dl)**:
   - High levels (> 200 mg/dl) could indicate an increased risk of heart disease.
   - Lower levels (< 200 mg/dl) might suggest a lower risk but should be considered in conjunction with other factors.

3. **Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg)**:
   - Elevated blood pressure (> 130/80 mmHg) is a significant risk factor for heart disease.

4. **Fasting Blood Sugar** and **Exercise Induced Angina**:
   - Presence of diabetes (indicated by Fasting Blood Sugar = true) or Exercise Induced Angina (yes) increases the risk of heart disease.

5. **ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest**:
   - Significant ST depression (> 1 mm) during exercise is indicative of ischemia and increased risk of heart disease.

6. **Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment**:
   - Downsloping or flat ST segments are more concerning for ischemia than upsloping.

7. **Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy**:
   - Fewer vessels colored (0, 1) may indicate more severe coronary artery disease.

A simplified decision tree based on these considerations might look like this:

- **Root Node**: Chest Pain Type
  - Typical angina: Proceed to Serum Cholesterol
    - High (> 200 mg/dl): Heart Disease Likely
    - Low (≤ 200 mg/dl): Evaluate Resting Blood Pressure
      - Elevated (> 130/80 mmHg): Heart Disease Possible
      - Normal (≤ 130/80 mmHg): Consider other factors like Fasting Blood Sugar, Exercise Induced Angina
  - Atypical angina or Non-anginal pain: Evaluate Serum Cholesterol and Resting Blood Pressure together
    - If either is abnormal, consider heart disease possible and evaluate further with ST Depression Induced by Exercise and Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment
  - Asymptomatic: Evaluate Risk Factors (Serum Cholesterol, Resting Blood Pressure, Fasting Blood Sugar)
    - Presence of multiple risk factors: Heart Disease Possible

- **Leaf Nodes**:
  - Heart Disease Likely: Indicates a high probability based on symptoms and risk factors.
  - Heart Disease Possible: Suggests the need for further evaluation or monitoring.
  - Low Risk: Indicated by absence of significant risk factors and symptoms.

This is a highly simplified example. Actual decision trees used in medical diagnoses are more complex, consider interactions between variables, and are typically derived from large datasets using machine learning algorithms like CART (Classification and Regression Trees), C4.5, or random forests, which can handle both categorical and numerical data effectively.

Here's how you can implement the decision tree as a Python function. The function `predict_heart_disease` takes in a dictionary of features and returns a tuple containing the predicted target variable (presence or absence of heart disease) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict_heart_disease(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a patient has heart disease based on their features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary of patient features, including 'age', 'sex', 'chest_pain', 
              'trestbps', 'chol', 'fbs', 'restecg', 'thalach', 'exang', 'oldpeak', 
              'slope', 'ca', 'thal'.
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the predicted target variable (0 = no heart disease, 1 = heart disease)
           and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """

    # Initialize the list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = [None] * 7
    
    # Node 0: Chest pain type is Typical angina (3)
    nodes[0] = X['chest_pain'] == 3
    
    # If chest pain type is not Typical angina, consider other factors
    if not nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Resting Blood Pressure is elevated (> 130 mmHg)
        nodes[1] = X['trestbps'] > 130
        
        # Node 2: Serum Cholesterol is high (> 200 mg/dl)
        nodes[2] = X['chol'] > 200
        
        # Node 3: Fasting Blood Sugar indicates diabetes (2 = true)
        nodes[3] = X['fbs'] == 2
        
        # Node 4: Exercise Induced Angina is present (2 = yes)
        nodes[4] = X['exang'] == 2
        
        # Node 5: ST Depression Induced by Exercise is significant (> 1)
        nodes[5] = X['oldpeak'] > 1
        
        # Node 6: Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy indicates severe disease (0 or 1)
        nodes[6] = X['ca'] <= 1
        
    else:
        # If chest pain type is Typical angina, prioritize it over other factors
        nodes[1:] = [False] * 6
    
    # Predict heart disease based on the nodes
    prediction = 0  # Assume no heart disease by default
    if nodes[0]:  # Typical angina
        prediction = 1
    elif any([nodes[1], nodes[2], nodes[3], nodes[4], nodes[5], nodes[6]]):  # Other risk factors present
        prediction = 1
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This implementation prioritizes the chest pain type as a key indicator of heart disease. If the patient has Typical angina (chest pain type 3), it predicts heart disease regardless of other factors. Otherwise, it considers other risk factors such as elevated resting blood pressure, high serum cholesterol, diabetes, exercise-induced angina, significant ST depression, and severe coronary artery disease indicated by fluoroscopy.

You can use the function like this:

```python
patient_features = {
    'age': 55,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 3,  # Typical angina
    'trestbps': 140,
    'chol': 220,
    'fbs': 2,  # Diabetes present
    'restecg': 2,  # Normal rest ECG
    'thalach': 160,
    'exang': 2,  # Exercise-induced angina present
    'oldpeak': 2.5,
    'slope': 1,  # Downsloping ST segment
    'ca': 1,  # One major vessel colored by fluoroscopy
    'thal': 2  # Normal thalassemia
}

prediction, nodes = predict_heart_disease(patient_features)
print(f"Predicted heart disease: {prediction}")
print(f"Inner node truth values: {nodes}")
```
