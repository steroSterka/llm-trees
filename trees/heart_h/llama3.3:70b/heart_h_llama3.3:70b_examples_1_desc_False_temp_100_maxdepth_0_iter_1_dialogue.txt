To induce a decision tree classifier for heart disease based on the given features, I'll follow a step-by-step approach. Since we're not working with actual data but rather feature names, I'll apply general knowledge about how these features relate to heart disease and use them to construct a logical decision tree.

### Step 1: Identify Key Features
- **Age (years)**: Older patients are more likely to have heart disease.
- **Sex**: Males generally have a higher risk of heart disease than females, especially at younger ages.
- **Chest Pain Type**: Typical angina is a strong indicator of heart disease.
- **Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg)** and **Serum Cholesterol (mg/dl)**: High values are associated with increased risk of heart disease.
- **Fasting Blood Sugar (true / false)**: Diabetes (implied by true) increases the risk of heart disease.
- **Resting Electrocardiographic Results**: Abnormalities indicate potential heart issues.
- **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm)** and **ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest**: These can indicate how the heart responds under stress, with significant ST depression being a concern.
- **Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment**: Downsloping is often associated with ischemia.
- **Exercise Induced Angina (yes / no)**: Presence indicates potential coronary artery disease.
- **Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy**: Lower numbers indicate more severe blockages, suggesting higher risk.
- **Thalassemia**: Indicates heart disease severity or potential for myocardial perfusion defects.

### Step 2: Construct Decision Tree
Given the complexity and the number of features, we'll prioritize those most directly related to heart disease diagnosis:

1. **Chest Pain Type**:
   - If Typical angina, proceed with suspicion of heart disease.
   - If Atypical angina or Non-anginal pain, consider other factors.
   - If Asymptomatic, still evaluate other risk factors.

2. **Exercise Induced Angina (yes / no)** and **ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest**:
   - Presence of induced angina or significant ST depression suggests heart disease.

3. **Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy**:
   - Lower numbers indicate more severe coronary artery disease.

4. **Resting Electrocardiographic Results** and **Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment**:
   - Abnormalities or downsloping suggest ischemia, indicating heart disease.

5. **Age (years)**, **Sex**, **Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg)**, **Serum Cholesterol (mg/dl)**, and **Fasting Blood Sugar (true / false)**:
   - These factors contribute to the overall risk profile but are less directly diagnostic than symptoms and test results.

### Decision Tree

|--- Chest Pain Type == Typical angina
||--- class: Heart Disease

|--- Exercise Induced Angina == yes OR ST Depression Induced by Exercise > 1
||--- class: Heart Disease

|--- Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy < 2
||--- class: Heart Disease

|--- Resting Electrocardiographic Results != Normal OR Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment == Downsloping
||--- class: Heart Disease

|--- Age > 60 AND (Sex == male OR Serum Cholesterol > 200 mg/dl)
||--- Consider further testing for heart disease, but lean towards possible heart disease

|--- All other conditions
||--- class: No Heart Disease

### Note:
This decision tree simplifies the complex interactions between these features and heart disease. In practice, a combination of features, possibly weighted by their importance as determined through statistical analysis or machine learning algorithms on actual patient data, would provide a more accurate diagnosis. The tree above is based on general medical knowledge and might not perfectly classify every patient without considering all nuances and combinations of risk factors.

Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree based on the provided features and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a patient has heart disease or not based on their characteristics.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the patient's characteristics.
              The keys are 'age', 'sex', 'chest_pain', 'trestbps', 'chol', 
              'fbs', 'restecg', 'thalach', 'exang', 'oldpeak', 'slope', 'ca', 'thal'.

    Returns:
    prediction (int): 1 if the patient has heart disease, 0 otherwise.
    nodes (list): A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """

    # Initialize the list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = [None] * 7

    # Node 1: Chest Pain Type == Typical angina
    nodes[0] = X['chest_pain'] == 3

    # Node 2: Exercise Induced Angina == yes OR ST Depression Induced by Exercise > 1
    nodes[1] = (X['exang'] == 2) or (X['oldpeak'] > 1)

    # Node 3: Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy < 2
    nodes[2] = X['ca'] < 2

    # Node 4: Resting Electrocardiographic Results != Normal OR Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment == Downsloping
    nodes[3] = (X['restecg'] != 2) or (X['slope'] == 1)

    # Node 5: Age > 60 AND Sex == male
    nodes[4] = (X['age'] > 60) and (X['sex'] == 'male')

    # Node 6: Serum Cholesterol > 200 mg/dl OR Fasting Blood Sugar == true
    nodes[5] = (X['chol'] > 200) or (X['fbs'] == 2)

    # Node 7: Maximum Heart Rate Achieved < 120 bpm
    nodes[6] = X['thalach'] < 120

    # Make the prediction based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    elif nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1
    elif nodes[2]:
        prediction = 1
    elif nodes[3]:
        prediction = 1
    elif nodes[4] and (nodes[5]):
        prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 0

    # Convert the boolean values to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

You can use this function by passing a dictionary `X` containing the patient's characteristics as follows:

```python
patient_characteristics = {
    'age': 65,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 3,
    'trestbps': 120,
    'chol': 220,
    'fbs': 2,
    'restecg': 1,
    'thalach': 110,
    'exang': 2,
    'oldpeak': 2,
    'slope': 1,
    'ca': 1,
    'thal': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_characteristics)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```
