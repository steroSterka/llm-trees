<think>

Okay, so I need to create a decision tree classifier for heart disease based on the given features, and the maximum depth is 2. Let me start by understanding the problem. The user provided an example with the Iris dataset and a decision tree built using petal width. Now, I need to do something similar but with the heart disease features.

First, I should list all the features again to make sure I have them right:

- age (years)
- sex (male/female)
- Chest Pain Type (four categories)
- Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg)
- Serum Cholesterol (mg/dl)
- Fasting Blood Sugar (true/false)
- Resting Electrocardiographic Results (three categories)
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm)
- Exercise Induced Angina (yes/no)
- ST Depression Induced by Exercise (0 to 5)
- Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (three categories)
- Number of Major Vessels Colored (0-3)
- Thalassemia (three categories)

The goal is to classify whether a patient has heart disease or not. Since it's a decision tree with max depth 2, each decision node can split on a feature, and after two splits, we have leaves with classes.

In the example, the first split was on petal width, then another split on the same feature. But for max depth 2, the tree can have two levels of splits. Wait, actually, a depth of 2 means the root is depth 1, then its children are depth 2. So the maximum number of splits is two levels. So the tree can have up to four leaves (if two splits), but maybe fewer if some branches stop earlier.

But how do I choose the best features? Since I don't have the actual data, I need to make an educated guess based on common knowledge or typical features that are important for heart disease. Alternatively, maybe the example is structured in a way that the most important features are at the top.

In real scenarios, we'd use information gain or Gini impurity to select the best features. But without data, I have to think which features are most critical.

Common risk factors for heart disease include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, diabetes (fasting blood sugar), ECG results, exercise-induced symptoms, etc.

Looking at the features:

- Chest Pain Type: Different types might correlate with heart disease. For example, asymptomatic might be worse?

- Fasting Blood Sugar: If >120 mg/dl, it's considered true, indicating diabetes, a risk factor.

- ST Depression: Higher values might indicate ischemia.

- Number of Major Vessels Colored: More blockages (higher number) could indicate disease.

- Thalassemia: A blood disorder, but maybe not as directly related, though some categories might be markers.

- Resting ECG Results: Abnormalities here could be a sign.

- Exercise Induced Angina: If yes, might be a sign.

- Maximum Heart Rate: Lower heart rate during exercise might be a sign of heart issues.

So, the first split should be on the feature that best separates the data. Let me think of the top candidates.

Perhaps "Number of Major Vessels Colored" (0-3). Since this directly relates to the number of blocked vessels. If someone has 0, maybe less likely, while higher numbers (2 or 3) might indicate disease. Alternatively, maybe Thalassemia, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, "Exercise Induced Angina" (yes/no) could be important. If exercise causes angina, that's a common symptom.

Alternatively, "ST Depression" (continuous value) could be a good split. Higher ST depression might indicate ischemia.

Wait, but in the example, the first split was on a continuous feature (petal width). Maybe here, using a continuous variable first might make sense. Let me think again.

Alternatively, "Chest Pain Type" is categorical with four options. Maybe splitting on that first, but with four categories, it might not be the best for a decision tree's first split unless one category is highly indicative.

Alternatively, Fasting Blood Sugar: if true (high sugar), that's a diabetes indicator, which is a known risk factor.

Alternatively, "Resting ECG Results": if normal vs abnormal.

Hmm. Alternatively, "ST Depression Induced by Exercise" is a continuous value from 0 to 5. Maybe splitting on that first. For instance, if ST depression is above a certain threshold, it's more likely heart disease.

Alternatively, the number of major vessels. Let me think of possible splits.

Alternatively, let's think of typical features in heart disease decision trees. In some datasets, the number of vessels colored and thallium stress test results (thalassemia here?) are important. Maybe Thalassemia has categories: Normal, Fixed defect, Reversible defect. Fixed defect might indicate worse condition.

Alternatively, maybe "Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment" where downsloping is worse.

Alternatively, "Age" might be important, but it's continuous. Maybe splitting on age over 50 or something.

Wait, but the user's example used a continuous feature first. Let me try to pick the most significant features.

Suppose I start with "Number of Major Vessels Colored". Let's say the split is if vessels > 0. So, if the number is 0, maybe lower risk; higher numbers indicate disease.

Alternatively, "Thalassemia" with fixed defect being a strong indicator.

Alternatively, "Exercise Induced Angina" (yes/no). If yes, then higher chance.

Alternatively, "ST Depression" as a continuous. Let's say if ST depression is greater than 1, then more likely.

Alternatively, "Chest Pain Type" as a categorical variable. For example, if the pain is non-anginal or asymptomatic, that might be more severe.

Alternatively, maybe "Fasting Blood Sugar" (if true, indicating diabetes) is a good first split.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky without data. Let's try to structure it step by step.

First, choose the root node feature. Let's pick "Number of Major Vessels Colored (0,1,2,3)". Suppose that if the number is 0, maybe lower chance, but higher numbers (like 2 or 3) indicate disease. So split at 1.5 (so vessels >1.5 is 2 or 3). So:

Root split: Number of Major Vessels Colored > 1.5?

If yes (>=2), then more likely to have heart disease.

If no (0 or 1), then check another feature.

Alternatively, maybe the split is between 0 and others? Maybe 0 vs 1-3.

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on Thalassemia. Suppose the second level after root splits is on Thalassemia's fixed defect.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on ST Depression.

Wait, let me think of another approach. Let's consider that the most predictive features in heart disease are often the ST depression induced by exercise, number of vessels, thalassemia, and chest pain type.

Alternatively, maybe starting with "Thalassemia" as the root node.

Suppose root is Thalassemia:

- If Thalassemia is "Normal" → lower risk

- If "Fixed defect" → higher risk

- "Reversible defect" → maybe intermediate.

But with max depth 2, after splitting on Thalassemia, each branch can split again.

Alternatively, another feature for the second split.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on the "Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment". For example, if the slope is Downsloping, that's worse.

Hmm, I might need to make some assumptions here.

Alternatively, let me think of the features that have been most commonly used in similar datasets. In the UCI Heart Disease dataset, for example, features like number of vessels, thal, slope, ST depression are important.

Let me try to structure a tree with two splits.

First, root node: Number of Major Vessels Colored (0-3). Let's split at 1.5 (so vessels >1.5 means 2 or 3). 

So:

Root: Number of Major Vessels Colored >1.5?

If yes (2 or 3), maybe the class is "has heart disease".

If no (0 or 1), then next split might be on another feature like Thalassemia.

So for the left branch (<=1.5 vessels), we split again on Thalassemia.

Suppose Thalassemia is "Normal" vs others. 

So, if Thalassemia is "Normal", then class is "no heart disease".

If Thalassemia is "Fixed defect" or "Reversible defect", then maybe "has heart disease".

Alternatively, maybe split on ST Depression. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on ST Depression. Let's say split at 1.5. If ST depression >1.5, then more likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on "Exercise Induced Angina" (yes/no). If yes, then higher chance. Then, the second split could be on "ST Depression".

Alternatively, let me think of the example given. They used petal width twice, but with max depth 2, so two splits. The first split was petal width <=0.8, then the other branch split again on petal width but higher threshold.

In our case, maybe the root is on a continuous feature like ST Depression, split at a certain value. Then the second split could be another feature.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on "Number of Major Vessels Colored", then the next split on "Thalassemia".

Alternatively, here's a possible structure:

Root: Number of Major Vessels Colored > 1.5?

- Yes (2 or 3): Class = Heart Disease

- No (0 or 1): Split on Thalassemia:

   - Thalassemia = "Normal": Class = No Heart Disease

   - Thalassemia = "Fixed defect" or "Reversible defect": Class = Heart Disease

Wait, but then the maximum depth would be 2. So that works. The first split (depth 1) is on Number of Vessels, then the second split on Thalassemia for the left branch. The right branch (vessels >1.5) is a leaf. The left branch splits again.

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on another feature. Let me see.

Alternatively, the root is on Thalassemia:

Root: Thalassemia = "Normal"?

- Yes: Then, perhaps split on another feature like ST Depression.

- No (Fixed or Reversible): Then maybe split on something else.

But maybe this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, here's another approach. Let me pick the two most important features. Suppose that the number of vessels and ST depression are the top two. So first split on vessels, then on ST.

Alternatively, maybe first split on ST Depression (split at 1.5), then split on vessels.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on "Exercise Induced Angina" (yes/no). If yes, then higher chance. Then split on ST Depression.

Wait, but without data, this is all guesswork.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on "Chest Pain Type" being Asymptomatic. Because asymptomatic might be a red flag.

Alternatively, "Fasting Blood Sugar" (if true, higher risk). So first split on FBS true?

Hmm.

Alternatively, let's think of common splits. In the UCI dataset, the number of vessels is a good predictor, and thalassemia. So here's a possible decision tree:

Root: Number of Major Vessels Colored > 1.5 (i.e., 2 or 3)?

- If yes → Class: Heart Disease

- If no → Split on Thalassemia:

   - If Thalassemia is "Normal" → Class: No Heart Disease

   - If Thalassemia is "Fixed defect" or "Reversible defect" → Class: Heart Disease

This way, the depth is 2, and uses two important features. That might be a reasonable structure.

Alternatively, maybe the second split on Thalassemia can be more nuanced. For instance, if Thalassemia is "Fixed defect", then yes, but "Reversible" might be split further, but given depth 2, they have to be leaves.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Thalassemia:

Root: Thalassemia = "Normal"?

- If yes → Split on another feature like ST Depression.

- If no → Split on something else.

Wait, but this might not be as effective.

Alternatively, here's another possibility. First split on "Number of Major Vessels Colored" as before, then for the <=1.5 group, split on "ST Depression Induced by Exercise" (split at 1.5):

- If ST Depression >1.5 → Heart Disease

- Else → No Heart Disease

So the tree would be:

Root: Vessels >1.5 → Yes: Heart Disease

No:

   ST Depression >1.5? 

      Yes: Heart Disease

      No: No Heart Disease

This also gives depth 2, and uses two important features.

Alternatively, combining these ideas, perhaps the first split is on vessels, then on ST depression.

Alternatively, another approach: The first split could be on "Exercise Induced Angina" (yes/no). 

If Exercise Angina is yes → Split on ST Depression:

   If ST Depression >2 → Heart Disease

   Else → Maybe no?

But that's a possible structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the most straightforward is to take the two most important features. Let's assume the number of vessels and thalassemia.

So the tree would be:

Root: Number of Major Vessels Colored > 1.5?

- Yes → Heart Disease

- No → Split on Thalassemia:

   - Thalassemia = "Normal" → No Heart Disease

   - Otherwise → Heart Disease

This way, it's simple and uses two features that are known to be important.

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on ST Depression. Let's say for the vessels <=1.5 group, split on ST Depression >1.5:

   ST Depression >1.5 → Heart Disease

   Else → No

This uses ST Depression as the second feature.

Alternatively, the first split is on ST Depression. Let's say split at 2.

Root: ST Depression >2?

- Yes → Heart Disease

- No → Split on Number of Vessels:

   Vessels >1 → Heart Disease

   Else → No

Hmm, but this might not be as accurate.

Alternatively, let's consider the example given. In the Iris example, they used a single feature (petal width) for both splits, but in a way that created a path. Maybe here, using a continuous feature first, then another.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on "ST Depression" (split at 1.5), then the next split on "Number of Vessels" (split at 1.5). But that might not be better.

Alternatively, maybe "Chest Pain Type" being "Asymptomatic" could be a first split:

Root: Chest Pain Type = Asymptomatic?

- Yes → Class: Heart Disease

- No → Split on another feature, like "ST Depression".

Alternatively, maybe "Fasting Blood Sugar" is a good first split because it's a binary feature.

Root: Fasting Blood Sugar = true (indicating high sugar)?

- Yes → Split on something else (like vessels?)

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think of possible splits where the majority of features would lead to a clear classification.

Perhaps the most straightforward is to use Number of Major Vessels Colored and Thalassemia as the two splits.

So, finalizing:

Decision Tree:

Root node: Number of Major Vessels Colored (0-3) >1.5?

- If yes → Class: Heart Disease

- If no → Split on Thalassemia:

   - Thalassemia = Normal → Class: No Heart Disease

   - Thalassemia = Fixed defect or Reversible defect → Class: Heart Disease

This way, the depth is 2, and uses two key features. Alternatively, maybe the second split uses ST Depression instead of Thalassemia.

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on ST Depression:

Root: Number of Major Vessels Colored >1.5 → Yes: Heart Disease

No → Split on ST Depression (exceeding, say, 1.5):

   ST Depression >1.5 → Heart Disease

   Else → No

This might also be good.

Alternatively, another possible split is on "Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment":

If the slope is Downsloping → more likely to have disease.

So:

Root: Slope is Downsloping?

- Yes → Heart Disease

- No → Split on another feature like vessels.

Hmm.

Since the user's example used a continuous feature split, perhaps I should pick a continuous feature first.

So, let's try:

Root: ST Depression Induced by Exercise >1.5?

- Yes → Heart Disease

- No → Split on Number of Major Vessels Colored >1.5:

   Yes → Heart Disease

   No → No Heart Disease

This way, two features, depth 2.

Alternatively, this might be better.

Alternatively, the first split on ST Depression, then on vessels.

Alternatively, the first split on vessels, then ST Depression.

Either way, this seems plausible.

But which features are the most important? Since I don't have the data, I'll have to make an educated guess.

In many heart disease datasets, the number of vessels and thalassemia are important. ST depression is also important. So perhaps combining those.

Alternatively, let's go with the first tree I thought of:

Root: Number of Major Vessels Colored >1.5?

- Yes → Heart Disease

- No → Split on Thalassemia:

   Thalassemia is Normal → No Heart Disease

   Else → Heart Disease

This uses two features and makes sense because having more vessels blocked (higher count) indicates disease. For those with fewer blocked vessels, thalassemia status (which relates to blood flow) might be a deciding factor.

Alternatively, if Thalassemia is "Normal", maybe the person doesn't have heart disease, but if it's abnormal, they do.

Alternatively, maybe the split on Thalassemia is more nuanced, but given depth, it has to be a binary split.

Alternatively, perhaps the second split should be on ST Depression.

Alternatively, here's another structure:

Root: Thalassemia is Normal?

- Yes → Split on Number of Vessels:

   Vessels >1 → Heart Disease

   No → No

- No → Split on ST Depression >1.5?

   Yes → Heart Disease

   No → Maybe No

But this complicates.

Alternatively, given the time I've spent, I'll go with the first structure I had, using Number of Vessels and Thalassemia.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the most predictive features.

Wait, perhaps the first split should be on "Exercise Induced Angina" (yes/no). Let's try that.

Root: Exercise Induced Angina = Yes?

- Yes → Split on ST Depression >1.5 → Yes: Heart Disease, No: Maybe No

- No → Split on something else.

This might also work.

Alternatively, perhaps the most important feature is ST depression. Let me think.

Alternatively, to align with common practice, the number of vessels and thalassemia are key.

So, I'll proceed with the first proposed tree:

Decision Tree:

Root node: Number of Major Vessels Colored >1.5?

- If yes → Class: Heart Disease

- If no → Split on Thalassemia:

   - Thalassemia = Normal → Class: No Heart Disease

   - Thalassemia = Fixed defect or Reversible defect → Class: Heart Disease

This seems logical and uses two important features with a depth of 2.

Alternatively, maybe the split on Thalassemia should be "Fixed defect", considering that "Reversible defect" might not be as bad. But without data, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the second split is on ST Depression.

Alternatively, let's see another possibility where the root is on ST Depression:

Root: ST Depression >2?

- Yes → Heart Disease

- No → Split on Number of Vessels >1.5 → Yes: Heart Disease, No: No

This also works and is depth 2.

I think either of these are acceptable. Since the user's example used a single feature twice, perhaps using ST Depression first and then Number of Vessels, or vice versa.

Alternatively, the first split could be on both ST Depression and Number of Vessels.

But given the requirement of depth 2, two splits.

Alternatively, here's another structure:

Root: ST Depression >1.5?

- Yes → Heart Disease

- No → Split on Thalassemia:

   - Thalassemia = Normal → No

   - Else → Heart Disease

This also works.

Hmm, I think I need to make a decision here. Since the user's example used the same feature twice in different paths, perhaps using a continuous feature first, then another.

Alternatively, to ensure that the maximum depth is two, the tree must have two splits. So the root is the first split, and one of its branches splits again, while the other is a leaf.

Thus, the structure is:

Root (split 1) → Left branch (split 2) → two leaves, Right branch is a leaf.

Therefore, the tree would look like:

Root: Feature A (split into two)

Left branch → split on Feature B into two leaves

Right branch → leaf.

So, the two features are Feature A and Feature B.

To choose Feature A and Feature B, pick the two most important.

Given that, let's go with:

Feature A: Number of Major Vessels Colored >1.5?

Feature B: Thalassemia status.

So the tree is as I first thought.

Alternatively, to use ST Depression as the second split:

Root: Number of Vessels >1.5 → Yes: HD

No → Split on ST Depression >1.5 → Yes: HD, No: No HD.

This also works.

Either way, both are valid. Since I can't verify which is better, I'll proceed with one.

Perhaps the most straightforward is:

Root: Number of Major Vessels Colored >1.5 → HD

Else → Split on ST Depression >1.5 → HD if yes, else No HD.

This uses two features and is depth 2.

Alternatively, another common feature might be "Chest Pain Type", but it's categorical with more categories.

Alternatively, given that in many cases, ST depression and number of vessels are key, I'll go with that.

Final Answer:

The decision tree with maximum depth 2 is structured as follows:

1. **Root Node**: If the patient has **Number of Major Vessels Colored > 1.5** (i.e., 2 or 3 vessels):
   - **Class**: Heart Disease (HD).

2. **Left Branch** (if ≤1.5 vessels):
   - **Split on ST Depression Induced by Exercise > 1.5**:
     - **Yes**: **Class**: HD.
     - **No**: **Class**: No Heart Disease (NHD).

Thus, the final decision tree is:

\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Root: } \text{Number of Major Vessels Colored} > 1.5? \\
&\quad \text{Yes} \rightarrow \text{Heart Disease} \\
&\quad \text{No} \rightarrow \text{ST Depression > 1.5?} \\
&\quad\quad \text{Yes} \rightarrow \text{Heart Disease} \\
&\quad\quad \text{No} \rightarrow \text{No Heart Disease}
\end{aligned}
}

<think>
Okay, so I need to create a Python function that acts as a decision tree for predicting heart disease based on the given features. The function should return a prediction (0 or 1) and a list of node truth values indicating which conditions were met. The user provided an example of such a function, so I should follow that structure.

First, I need to understand the features and their encodings because that's crucial for setting up the conditions in the decision tree. Let me go through each feature again to make sure I get the details right.

The features are:
- age (years)
- sex (male/female)
- chest_pain (encoded as 3, 0, 2, 1 for different types)
- trestbps (resting blood pressure in mmHg)
- chol (serum cholesterol in mg/dl)
- fbs (fasting blood sugar: 1 = false, 2 = true)
- restecg (ECG results: 2=normal, 1=left ventricular hypertrophy, 3=ST-T abnormality)
- thalach (max heart rate achieved in bpm)
- exang (exercise-induced angina: 1=no, 2=yes)
- oldpeak (ST depression, 0-5)
- slope (slope of peak ST segment: 3=upsloping, 2=flat, 1=downsloping)
- ca (number of colored vessels, 0-3)
- thal (thalassemia: 2=normal, 1=fixed defect, 3=reversible defect)
- target is the output (0=no, 1=yes).

The example given was a depth 2 tree, so maybe I need to think of a similar structure here. Since the user mentioned "if your decision tree has placeholders, fill with meaningful values," perhaps I can come up with a reasonable decision tree based on these features. 

Let me think of possible splits. The target is to predict heart disease. Common features used in such models include age, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, maximum heart rate, etc.

Let me start by choosing the first split. Maybe age? Let's say if age is over 50, that's a risk factor. But maybe the first node could be something like age > 50? Wait, but in the example, the decision tree's nodes are stored in a list, and each node is a condition. Let me think of a possible decision tree structure.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is based on chest pain. Since chest_pain has different values (3, 0, 2, 1), maybe if the chest_pain is 0 (asymptomatic) or 2 (non-anginal) it could be a risk factor. Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on thalach (max heart rate). People with lower max heart rates might be at higher risk?

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on oldpeak. Higher oldpeak (ST depression) could indicate issues. For example, if oldpeak > 1.5, then that's a risk. 

Alternatively, let's think of a possible decision tree structure. Let me try to come up with a simple one.

Suppose the first node is whether the patient's age is over 50. If yes, then check another condition. Let's say the second node is whether the thalach (max heart rate) is below a certain threshold. Maybe if age >50, and thalach < 130, then predict 1 (heart disease). Or something like that.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the conditions are based on the encoded features correctly. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on chest_pain. For instance, if the chest pain type is asymptomatic (0) or non-anginal (2), that might be a higher risk. Suppose the first condition is chest_pain <= 1 (since 0 and 1 are asymptomatic and atypical angina?), but I need to check the encoding again. The chest_pain feature's encoding is: 3 = Typical angina, 0 = Asymptomatic, 2 = Non-anginal pain, 1 = Atypical angina. So the values are 0,1,2,3. So if the chest_pain is 0 (asymptomatic) or 1 (atypical), maybe that's a risk. So perhaps the first condition is chest_pain <= 1?

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the thalassemia (thal) feature. Thal values: 2 is normal, 1 is fixed defect, 3 is reversible. Maybe if thal is 1 (fixed defect) or 3 (reversible), that's a risk. So, thal != 2?

Hmm, perhaps building a decision tree based on medical knowledge. Let me think of some splits:

1. If thalach (max heart rate) is less than 120, then higher risk (since lower heart rate could indicate issues).
2. Or, if oldpeak is greater than 2, indicating significant ST depression.
3. Also, exang (exercise induced angina): if yes (exang=2), that's a risk factor.

Alternatively, maybe the decision tree structure would be like this (depth 2):

First split on age > 50:
- If yes, then split on thalach < 130 → predict 1 (heart disease)
- Else, maybe check another condition like oldpeak > 2?

Alternatively, let's think of an example. Let me try to come up with a plausible decision tree. Suppose the first node is oldpeak > 2. If yes, then predict 1. If no, then check another condition like slope (slope of ST segment). For example, if slope is downsloping (1) then predict 1, else 0.

But I need to structure this as a depth 2 tree. The example given had two nodes, so perhaps the function's nodes list is of length equal to the number of internal nodes. The example had nodes[0] and nodes[1], so two nodes. The first node is the root, then the second is a child of the root.

Alternatively, let me try to design a simple decision tree with two splits. Let's say the first split is on chest_pain being asymptomatic (0) or non-anginal (2). Wait, chest_pain's encoding: 3 is typical angina (maybe lower risk?), 0 asymptomatic (higher?), 2 non-anginal, 1 atypical. So maybe if chest_pain is 0 or 2 (i.e., chest_pain <= 2?), then proceed to another condition.

Alternatively, first split on the presence of exercise-induced angina (exang). If exang is yes (value 2), then predict 1. Else, check another condition like oldpeak.

Wait, here's a possible decision tree structure:

Root node: exang == 2 (exercise-induced angina present). 

If yes (exang is 2), then predict 1. 

If no (exang is 1), then check another condition, like oldpeak > 1.5. 

If oldpeak >1.5, predict 1, else 0.

Wait, but then the nodes would be two: the first condition is exang ==2 (or exang >=2?), but in the features, exang is 1= no, 2= yes. So exang is 2 would be yes. So the first condition could be X['exang'] == 2?

Wait, but in code, conditions are usually using comparisons. So maybe the first node is X['exang'] >= 2, which is equivalent to exang being 2 (since it's either 1 or 2).

So nodes[0] = (X['exang'] >=2). 

Then, if that is true, prediction is 1 (since they have exercise-induced angina, which is a risk factor for heart disease).

If the first condition is false (exang is 1), then check another node, say oldpeak > 1.5. 

So nodes[1] = X['oldpeak'] >1.5 

So then, the prediction would be:

if nodes[0] is True (exang is 2), then prediction is 1.

else, if nodes[1] (oldpeak>1.5) is True, predict 1, else 0.

Wait, but in the example given, the structure was nested ifs. Let me structure it as follows.

def predict(X):
    nodes = [None, None]
    nodes[0] = (X['exang'] >= 2)
    nodes[1] = (X['oldpeak'] > 1.5)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but that would have two nodes. The first node is exang >=2 (root), then the second node (for the left branch?) is oldpeak. 

Alternatively, maybe the second node is under the else path of the first node. 

Hmm, that's a possible structure. But I need to make sure that the nodes are stored in the list in the order of their positions in the tree. The example had nodes[0] as the root and nodes[1] as the next node in the first branch.

Alternatively, perhaps another structure. Let me think of another example. Maybe the first split is on age > 50, then the second split on cholesterol level.

Alternatively, here's another approach: Let's choose a decision tree with two splits. The first split is on the chest_pain value being asymptomatic (0) or non-anginal (2). So, if chest_pain is 0 or 2 (i.e., chest_pain <=2?), then proceed to check another condition. Let's say the next condition is thalach < 120. 

So nodes[0] = (X['chest_pain'] <= 2)

Then, if that's true, check if thalach < 120 (nodes[1] = X['thalach'] <120). 

Then, the prediction would be:

if nodes[0] is True, then:

   if nodes[1] (thalach <120) is True → predict 1,

   else predict 0

else (chest_pain >2 → which is 3, typical angina), predict 0?

Hmm, but maybe that's not the best. Alternatively, maybe the second node is oldpeak > 1.5. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first node is thalassemia being abnormal (thal !=2). So nodes[0] = (X['thal'] != 2). Then, if true, predict 1. Else, check another condition like age > 60.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the conditions are based on the feature encodings. Let me think again.

Alternatively, let's think of a medical perspective. For example:

- If the person has a high cholesterol (chol) level, say over 250 mg/dl, that's a risk. 

- Or, if the ST depression (oldpeak) is over 2, indicating significant depression.

Perhaps the first split is on oldpeak >2. If yes → predict 1. If not, check another condition like slope. For example, if slope is downsloping (slope=1), predict 1, else 0.

So the nodes would be:

nodes[0] = X['oldpeak'] >2

nodes[1] = X['slope'] ==1 

Then, the code would be:

if nodes[0] → prediction is 1.

else:

   if nodes[1] → prediction is 1 else 0.

So the function would look like:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [None, None]
    nodes[0] = X['oldpeak'] > 2
    nodes[1] = X['slope'] ==1
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction =1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction=1
        else:
            prediction=0
    return prediction, nodes

This is a depth-2 tree, with two nodes. That seems plausible. The features used are oldpeak and slope. 

Alternatively, another example: first split on thalach (max heart rate) < 120. Then, if yes, check exang (exercise induced angina) being present (exang=2).

So nodes[0] = X['thalach'] <120

nodes[1] = X['exang'] ==2 

Then, if thalach<120 and exang is 2 → predict 1. Or, if thalach<120 but exang is 1 → maybe still 1? Wait, perhaps the structure:

if nodes[0] (thalach <120):

   if nodes[1] (exang is 2), then predict 1,

   else (exang is 1), predict 0?

Wait, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps:

if thalach <120 → predict 1 regardless of other factors. But then the second node is redundant. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the second node is part of the else path. For example:

if thalach <120 → predict 1,

else (thalach >=120):

   if slope is downsloping (slope=1) → predict 1,

   else → 0.

Thus, nodes[0] = X['thalach'] <120,

nodes[1] = X['slope'] ==1 

Then the code:

if nodes[0] → prediction 1.

else:

   if nodes[1] → 1 else 0.

This is also a valid structure.

I need to choose a structure that uses the given features properly, ensuring that the conditions are based on their encodings. 

Alternatively, let's think of another approach. Let's say the first split is on the chest_pain being asymptomatic (0). So nodes[0] = X['chest_pain'] ==0.

If yes, then predict 1.

Else, check another condition like oldpeak >1.5.

So nodes[1] = X['oldpeak']>1.5 

Thus, the code would be:

if nodes[0] → predict 1,

else:

   if nodes[1] → predict 1,

   else → 0.

This is a depth-2 tree. But maybe that's plausible.

Alternatively, let's go with the first example I thought of with oldpeak and slope.

Alternatively, another possibility: the first node is exang (exercise-induced angina present) → if yes, predict 1. Else, check oldpeak.

Because exercise-induced angina is a strong indicator.

So nodes[0] = X['exang'] ==2.

If yes → predict 1,

else → check oldpeak>1.5 → nodes[1] = X['oldpeak']>1.5 → if yes predict 1, else 0.

This seems reasonable.

So, in code:

nodes[0] = (X['exang'] ==2)

nodes[1] = (X['oldpeak']>1.5)

Then:

if nodes[0]:

   prediction =1

else:

   if nodes[1]:

       prediction=1

   else:

       prediction=0

This would be a valid tree.

Alternatively, perhaps using the slope and oldpeak together.

Alternatively, I can choose another feature combination. Let me pick this structure as the example.

Proceeding with that structure, the code would be as follows:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [None, None]
    nodes[0] = (X['exang'] == 2)
    nodes[1] = (X['oldpeak'] > 1.5)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes

This uses exang and oldpeak. 

Alternatively, the first condition could be on age. For example, age>60 → then check another condition.

Alternatively, perhaps using the chest_pain and slope.

Another example: first split on chest_pain ==0 (asymptomatic), then if yes, predict 1. Else, check if slope is downsloping (slope=1). 

nodes[0] = (X['chest_pain'] ==0),

nodes[1] = (X['slope'] ==1),

Thus, the code would be:

if nodes[0] →1,

else:

   if nodes[1] →1,

   else →0.

This is also plausible.

Now, I need to decide which one to use. Since the user is asking for a sample, any plausible structure is okay. Let me choose the first one I thought of with exang and oldpeak.

Alternatively, to ensure the nodes are in order and the code structure is similar to the example given, perhaps I can proceed with that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the following:

Root node: if oldpeak > 2 → predict 1.

Else, check if slope is downsloping (slope ==1) → predict 1 else 0.

Thus, nodes[0] = X['oldpeak']>2,

nodes[1] = X['slope'] ==1.

So the code would be:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [None, None]
    nodes[0] = (X['oldpeak'] > 2)
    nodes[1] = (X['slope'] == 1)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes

This is another possible structure.

Alternatively, maybe use the maximum heart rate (thalach). Let's see:

First node: thalach <120 → predict 1,

Else → check slope ==1 → predict 1 else 0.

nodes[0] = (X['thalach'] <120),

nodes[1] = (X['slope'] ==1).

Thus:

if nodes[0] →1,

else:

   if nodes[1] →1 else 0.

This is also okay.

I think any of these would work. To pick one, let me go with the exang and oldpeak example.

Thus, the final code would be:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [None, None]
    nodes[0] = (X['exang'] == 2)  # Exercise-induced angina present?
    nodes[1] = (X['oldpeak'] > 1.5)  # Oldpeak value higher than 1.5?
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # If exercise angina present, predict heart disease
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # If oldpeak >1.5, predict heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Else, no heart disease
    return prediction, nodes

This code uses the features 'exang' and 'oldpeak', both of which are relevant to heart disease.

Alternatively, the user may have different features, but since the question is general, this should be okay.
