<think>

Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants me to create a decision tree classifier for heart disease using the given features, with a maximum depth of 2. They provided an example using the Iris dataset, so I need to follow a similar structure but apply it to the heart disease features.

First, I need to understand the features provided for the heart disease classification. Let me list them out again to make sure I have them all:

- Age (years)
- Sex (male/female)
- Chest Pain Type (four categories)
- Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg)
- Serum Cholesterol (mg/dl)
- Fasting Blood Sugar (boolean: true/false)
- Resting Electrocardiographic Results (three categories)
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm)
- Exercise Induced Angina (yes/no)
- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest (0 to 5)
- Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (three categories)
- Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (0-3)
- Thalassemia (three categories: Normal, Fixed defect, Reversible defect)

The goal is to classify whether a patient has heart disease (probably a binary classification, but the problem doesn't specify if it's binary or multi-class. However, given the example, I'll assume binary: has heart disease or not).

The user wants a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. That means the root node splits on one feature, then each of those branches can split again on another feature, but no further splits after that. The leaves will be the classes (heart disease present or not).

Now, the key here is to choose the most important features for splitting. Since I don't have the actual data, I need to rely on domain knowledge or common important features in heart disease prediction. Alternatively, maybe the example uses certain criteria, like information gain or Gini impurity, but since I can't compute that without data, I'll have to make educated guesses based on medical knowledge.

Let's think about which features are most critical in heart disease diagnosis. 

1. **Chest Pain Type**: Different types of chest pain can be indicative. For example, non-anginal pain or asymptomatic might be less likely, while typical angina might be more common in heart disease. But I'm not sure of the exact associations.

2. **ST Depression Induced by Exercise**: ST depression during exercise is a key indicator of ischemia, which is related to heart disease.

3. **Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment**: An upsloping slope is more likely benign, while flat or downsloping might indicate issues.

4. **Number of Major Vessels Colored**: If the vessels are blocked (higher number?), maybe that's a sign. Wait, actually, the number of major vessels colored (0-3) could be an indicator of coronary artery disease. More blockage (higher numbers?) might be worse, but I need to recall: typically, in angiography, the number of vessels with significant stenosis is counted, so higher numbers would indicate worse disease. But the feature here is the number colored by fluoroscopy. Maybe higher numbers indicate more blockages, so if someone has 2 or 3 vessels colored, that's worse.

5. **Thalassemia**: Thalassemia is a blood disorder, but in heart disease datasets, Thalassemia status (Normal, Fixed defect, Reversible defect) might be a significant predictor. Fixed defect might indicate a prior heart attack or blockage.

6. **Exercise Induced Angina**: If angina occurs during exercise, that's a classic sign of coronary artery disease.

7. **Fasting Blood Sugar**: High fasting blood sugar (true) might be a risk factor for heart disease.

8. **Resting Blood Pressure and Cholesterol**: High levels are risk factors, but maybe not as strong as the exercise-related features.

9. **Age and Sex**: Older individuals and males are at higher risk.

Given that the tree can only have a maximum depth of 2, I need to choose the top 2 features that split the data best. Let's try to think of the best splits.

Starting with the root node: The most important feature. In many heart disease models, features like ST depression, chest pain type, or number of vessels are often important. Alternatively, maybe thalassemia or exercise-induced angina.

Suppose the root node is "ST Depression Induced by Exercise" because it's a direct measure of ischemia during stress. Let's say the split is at a certain value. The example uses a threshold (<=0.8). Since ST depression is a continuous variable here (0 to 5), perhaps splitting at a certain point like 1.0 or 2.0.

Then, the second level splits would be on another feature, maybe "Number of Major Vessels Colored" or "Thalassemia".

Alternatively, maybe "Chest Pain Type" as the root, but that's categorical with four options, which might split into multiple branches, but depth 2 could allow that. However, in the example, they used a continuous feature first, so maybe better to pick a continuous variable first.

Alternatively, "Thalassemia" is categorical, but maybe "Normal" vs "Defects" could be a split. Let's see.

Alternatively, "Exercise Induced Angina" (yes/no) is a boolean. If the root is "Exercise Induced Angina", then split into yes/no. Then, each of those branches can split again. For example, if yes, then split on "ST Depression" or "Number of Vessels".

But let me try to think of a possible decision tree structure.

First, let's try to think of possible splits:

Suppose the root is "ST Depression Induced by Exercise (mm) > 1.5". If ST depression is high, that's bad.

Then, for the left branch (<=1.5), maybe split on "Number of Major Vessels Colored". If vessels are 0-1, maybe lower risk; 2-3 higher.

Alternatively, the right branch (>1.5) could split on another feature, like "Thalassemia".

Alternatively, maybe the root is "Chest Pain Type". For example, if the chest pain is "Non-anginal" or "Asymptomatic", maybe lower risk, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, "Thalassemia" is a good split. For instance, if Thalassemia is "Normal", then maybe lower risk, while "Fixed defect" might indicate higher risk. But since it's a three-way split (Normal, Fixed defect, Reversible defect), that might complicate the depth.

Wait, but the maximum depth is 2. So the root is one feature, then each of its branches can split again. So if the root is a categorical feature with three options, then each of those three branches could split again, but that would still be depth 2. But maybe the user expects binary splits? The example uses binary splits (<= vs >), even on a categorical feature. Wait, in the example, the petal width is continuous, but when splitting on categorical features, you have to split into groups. For example, if the feature is categorical, you can split into two groups (e.g., grouping some categories together).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to pick continuous features first to keep splits binary.

Let me try to think of possible splits step by step.

Starting with the root node. The most important feature might be "ST Depression Induced by Exercise". Let's use that.

Root Node: ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest <= X.

Suppose the threshold is 1.0. So:

- If ST Depression <=1.0: then classify or split further.

- If ST Depression >1.0: then classify or split further.

Then, for the left branch (<=1.0), perhaps split on "Number of Major Vessels Colored". Let's say if vessels are 0-1 vs 2-3.

For the right branch (>1.0), maybe split on "Thalassemia" (Normal vs Defects).

Alternatively, for the left branch, maybe split on "Exercise Induced Angina".

Alternatively, maybe "Chest Pain Type".

Alternatively, maybe "Thalassemia" is better.

Alternatively, if the root is "Thalassemia", splitting into Normal vs others (Fixed or Reversible defect). Then, in each of those branches, split on another feature like ST Depression.

But perhaps the first approach is better. Let me try to outline it.

Root: ST Depression Induced by Exercise > 1.5?

Wait, let me think of possible values. The feature is ST Depression from 0 to 5. Suppose the split is at 1.5. Then:

Left branch: ST Depression <=1.5

Right branch: ST Depression >1.5

At the right branch, which is higher ST depression (indicative of heart disease), perhaps the next split is on something like "Number of Major Vessels Colored". Let's say if vessels are 2 or 3, indicating more blockages, then higher risk. So split at 1.5 vessels? Wait, the number is 0-3. So maybe split at 1.5: vessels <=1 vs >1.

Alternatively, split at 2. So if vessels are 2 or 3, that's higher.

Alternatively, maybe split on "Thalassemia" (Normal vs defect). If Thalassemia is normal, then maybe lower risk, but combined with high ST depression, maybe still high risk.

Alternatively, for the right branch (ST Depression >1.5), maybe split on "Exercise Induced Angina" (yes/no). If yes, then higher risk.

Alternatively, perhaps "Chest Pain Type" as the second split.

Alternatively, the left branch (ST Depression <=1.5) could split on "Exercise Induced Angina" (no angina may mean lower risk, but not sure).

Alternatively, maybe the left branch splits on "Number of Vessels". If vessels are 0-1, classify as no disease, else yes.

But this is getting a bit vague without data. Let me try to make a plausible tree.

Alternatively, maybe the root node is "Thalassemia". Let's see:

Root: Thalassemia = Normal vs (Fixed defect or Reversible defect)

If Normal, maybe lower risk. If defect, higher risk. Then, each branch splits again.

For the Normal branch (Thalassemia normal), maybe split on "ST Depression". If ST Depression is high, then despite normal Thalassemia, there's disease.

Alternatively, the other way around.

Alternatively, maybe "Chest Pain Type" is better as root. Let's consider:

Root: Chest Pain Type = Asymptomatic vs others. Because asymptomatic might have different risks.

Alternatively, maybe "Exercise Induced Angina" as the root. If yes, then higher risk.

Hmm, this is tricky without data. Let me think of common decision trees in heart disease.

In some studies, features like ST depression, number of vessels, thalassemia, and chest pain type are important. Let me look up typical splits (but since I can't, I'll proceed).

Alternatively, let's pick "ST Depression Induced by Exercise" as root, split at 1.5. Then:

Left branch (<=1.5):

Maybe split on "Number of Major Vessels Colored" (split at 1.5: <=1 vs >1)

Right branch (>1.5):

Split on "Thalassemia" (Normal vs others)

So:

Root: ST Depression Induced by Exercise <= 1.5?

Left (<=1.5):

Split on Number of Major Vessels Colored <=1?

If yes (<=1 vessels), then maybe class: no heart disease.

If no (>1 vessels), then class: yes.

Right (>1.5 ST Depression):

Split on Thalassemia Normal vs others.

If Normal, maybe still class: yes (since high ST depression), but maybe not? Or maybe if Thalassemia is normal, then lower risk?

Alternatively, if Thalassemia is not normal (Fixed or Reversible defect), then higher risk.

Alternatively, perhaps:

Right branch (ST>1.5):

Split on Exercise Induced Angina (yes/no). If yes, then higher risk.

But perhaps:

Right (ST>1.5):

Split on Thalassemia Normal vs others. If Thalassemia is normal, perhaps class: yes, but maybe the presence of high ST depression overrides Thalassemia.

Alternatively, maybe:

Right (ST>1.5):

Split on Number of Vessels. If vessels are high, then yes.

Alternatively, maybe:

Right (ST>1.5):

Split on Chest Pain Type. For example, if it's typical angina, then yes.

This is getting too speculative. Let me try to structure a plausible decision tree with depth 2.

Another approach: use the example's structure. In the example, the root was a continuous feature (petal width), split into <=0.8, then for the >0.8 branch, another split on petal width again (<=1.75). But since depth is 2, the second split could be on another feature. Wait, in the example, after the first split (petal width <=0.8), the left branch is a leaf (setosa). The right branch splits again on petal width >1.75, leading to virginica, else versicolor.

So in the example, depth 2 allows one split on the root, then another split on the same or another feature on one of the branches.

So in our case, maybe the root is a feature, and then each branch can split on another feature, but not both branches need to split again. Wait, depth is the maximum depth. So if one branch splits again, and the other doesn't, that's okay as long as the maximum depth is 2.

Alternatively, both branches split again, so depth is 2.

Let me try to structure it as follows:

Root node: ST Depression Induced by Exercise (continuous) <= X. Let's choose X as 1.5.

Left branch (<=1.5):

Split on Number of Major Vessels Colored (0-3). Let's say split at 1.5 (so <=1 vs >1). So:

Left branch (ST Depression <=1.5) -> split on Vessels:

- Vessels <=1: class No Heart Disease

- Vessels >1: class Yes

Right branch (ST Depression >1.5):

Split on Thalassemia:

- Thalassemia Normal: class Maybe No?

But if ST Depression is high, maybe even with normal Thalassemia, it's Yes. Hmm, maybe instead split on another feature here.

Alternatively, split on Exercise Induced Angina (yes/no):

- If yes, then class Yes.

- If no, then class Maybe No? Not sure.

Alternatively, split on Fasting Blood Sugar (true/false). If high blood sugar (true), then yes.

Alternatively, maybe:

Right branch (ST Depression >1.5):

Split on Number of Vessels again, but that's redundant.

Alternatively, split on Chest Pain Type. For example, if Chest Pain is Asymptomatic, then lower risk? Not sure.

Alternatively, let's think of the other direction:

Root node: Thalassemia (categorical). Split into Normal vs others (Fixed defect or Reversible defect). Since it's a categorical feature, we can have two branches.

Left branch (Thalassemia Normal):

Split on ST Depression (maybe >1.5 again).

Right branch (Thalassemia not Normal):

Split on another feature, like ST Depression.

But this might not be as straightforward.

Alternatively, let's try another approach. Let me pick the two most important features as root and next level.

Suppose the most important is "ST Depression", then the next is "Number of Major Vessels Colored".

So:

Root: ST Depression >1.5?

Left (<=1.5):

Then split on Vessels:

Vessels >1?

If yes (Vessels >1): Yes heart disease.

If no (Vessels <=1): No.

Right (>1.5 ST Depression):

Then split on Thalassemia (Normal vs others). Since Thalassemia is a categorical variable with three options, splitting into two groups (Normal vs others) is acceptable.

If Thalassemia is Normal: Maybe the class is Yes (since high ST depression but normal thalassemia?), but not sure. Alternatively, maybe the presence of high ST depression plus non-normal thalassemia is worse.

Alternatively, if Thalassemia is not Normal (Fixed or Reversible defect), then class Yes. Otherwise, maybe class Yes anyway because ST is high.

Hmm, this is tricky. Alternatively, maybe the second split on Thalassemia for the right branch could lead to:

If Thalassemia is Normal: class No (since maybe high ST but thalassemia is normal? Not sure)

But that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe regardless of Thalassemia, if ST is high, class is Yes, but the split is to refine.

Alternatively, maybe for the right branch (ST>1.5):

Split on Exercise Induced Angina (Yes/No):

- Yes: Yes heart disease

- No: Maybe No?

Alternatively, maybe the second split on the right is on another feature like Chest Pain Type.

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on a different feature.

Alternatively, let's try to make the tree as follows:

Root: ST Depression Induced by Exercise > 1.5?

Yes -> Right branch

No -> Left branch

Left branch (ST <=1.5):

Split on Number of Major Vessels Colored >1?

Yes -> Yes heart disease

No -> No

Right branch (ST >1.5):

Split on Thalassemia Normal?

Yes (Normal) -> No heart disease

No (Defect) -> Yes heart disease

This way, the logic is:

If ST is high but Thalassemia is normal, then maybe it's not heart disease, but that might not be accurate. Alternatively, maybe even with normal Thalassemia, high ST indicates disease.

Alternatively, flip the classification for the Thalassemia split:

Right branch (ST>1.5):

Split on Thalassemia Normal?

Yes (Normal): Yes heart disease (since high ST)

No (Defect): Yes heart disease (even more so)

But then both branches would be Yes, which doesn't help.

Hmm, perhaps splitting on Thalassemia isn't useful here.

Alternative approach for the right branch:

Split on Exercise Induced Angina.

Right branch (ST>1.5):

Split on Exercise Induced Angina (Yes/No):

- Yes -> Yes heart disease

- No -> No heart disease

This way, if ST is high and you have exercise-induced angina, it's a strong indicator, but if not, maybe it's a false positive?

Alternatively, maybe:

Right branch (ST>1.5):

Split on Number of Vessels again, but that's redundant.

Alternatively, split on Chest Pain Type:

Right branch (ST>1.5):

Split on Chest Pain Type = Asymptomatic?

Yes -> No heart disease (unlikely)

No -> Yes

But asymptomatic with high ST might still be disease.

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on a different feature.

Alternatively, perhaps the second split on the right is on Fasting Blood Sugar (true/false). If high blood sugar, then yes.

This is really challenging without data. Let me think of another structure.

Alternatively, maybe the root is "Number of Major Vessels Colored".

Root: Vessels >1?

Yes -> Right branch

No -> Left branch

Left branch (Vessels <=1):

Split on ST Depression >1.5?

Yes -> Yes heart disease

No -> No

Right branch (Vessels >1):

Split on ST Depression >1.5?

Yes -> Yes

No -> Maybe No? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps:

Root: ST Depression >1.5?

Left branch (<=1.5):

Split on Exercise Induced Angina (Yes/No):

- Yes -> Yes

- No -> No

Right branch (>1.5):

Split on Thalassemia (Normal/Defect):

- Defect -> Yes

- Normal -> Maybe No?

But again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the second split on the right is on Chest Pain Type.

Given the uncertainty, perhaps the most straightforward is to have:

Root: ST Depression Induced by Exercise > 1.5?

Left (<=1.5):

Split on Number of Major Vessels Colored >1?

Yes -> Yes

No -> No

Right (>1.5):

Split on Thalassemia (Normal vs others):

- If Thalassemia Normal: Maybe No (but that might not be right)

Alternatively, maybe on the right branch, regardless of Thalassemia, it's Yes. But then why split?

Alternatively, the split on Thalassemia could be to differentiate between those with defects (higher risk) and normal (maybe lower risk but still high ST).

Alternatively, perhaps the second split on the right is on another feature, like Fasting Blood Sugar.

Alternatively, let's try to outline the tree as follows, even if it's hypothetical:

Decision Tree:

1. Root: ST Depression Induced by Exercise > 1.5?

   - Yes → Go to node 2

   - No → Go to node 3

2. Node 2 (ST >1.5):

   Split on Thalassemia: Is it Normal?

   - Yes (Normal) → Class: Yes (Heart Disease)

   - No (Defect) → Class: Yes (Heart Disease)

   (This makes both branches lead to Yes, so maybe this isn't useful. Perhaps split on another feature.)

Alternatively, Node 2 (ST >1.5):

   Split on Exercise Induced Angina (Yes/No):

   - Yes → Class: Yes

   - No → Class: No (maybe some cases where high ST but no angina isn't disease)

3. Node 3 (ST ≤1.5):

   Split on Number of Major Vessels Colored >1?

   - Yes → Class: Yes

   - No → Class: No

This way, the logic is:

- High ST depression combined with exercise-induced angina → Yes

- High ST but no angina → No (maybe not enough evidence)

- Low ST but high vessels → Yes

- Low ST and low vessels → No

This might make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps Node 2 (ST >1.5):

   Split on Number of Vessels again. But redundant.

Alternatively, maybe Node 2 splits on Chest Pain Type:

   Is Chest Pain Asymptomatic?

   - Yes → Class: No (maybe)

   - No → Class: Yes

But asymptomatic with high ST might still have disease.

Alternatively, maybe:

Node 2 splits on Thalassemia:

- If Thalassemia is Normal → Class: No (unlikely, since high ST)

- If Defect → Class: Yes

But this could be incorrect.

Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the first plausible structure I had, even if it's not perfect:

Decision Tree:

1. **Root**: Is ST Depression Induced by Exercise > 1.5?

   - **Yes** → Go to Node 2

   - **No** → Go to Node 3

2. **Node 2** (ST >1.5):

   **Split on Thalassemia Normal?**

   - **Yes (Normal)** → **Class: Yes (Heart Disease)**

   - **No (Defect)** → **Class: Yes (Heart Disease)**

   (This makes both branches lead to Yes, so maybe instead split on another feature like Exercise Induced Angina)

   Alternative Node 2:

   **Split on Exercise Induced Angina (Yes/No)?**

   - **Yes** → **Class: Yes**

   - **No** → **Class: No**

3. **Node 3** (ST ≤1.5):

   **Split on Number of Major Vessels Colored >1?**

   - **Yes (>1)** → **Class: Yes**

   - **No (≤1)** → **Class: No**

This way, the tree is:

- If ST is high and angina is present → Yes

- If ST is high but angina absent → No (maybe false positive or other factors)

- If ST is low but vessels are high → Yes

- If both low → No

This seems more balanced.

Alternatively, maybe Node 3 splits on another feature like Chest Pain Type.

Alternatively, let's finalize with this structure, as it's a common approach in such scenarios.

Another possibility is using "Chest Pain Type" as the first split, but without data, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the root is "Thalassemia" and second split on ST.

But given the time, I'll proceed with the above structure. Let me write it clearly.



#########################


<think>

Okay, I need to create a Python function that acts as a decision tree for predicting heart disease based on the given features. The function should return a prediction and a list of node truth values. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, the features and their descriptions are provided. The target variable is 'target' where 1 means the patient has heart disease and 0 means no. The example given uses a decision tree structure with nodes and conditions. My task is to replicate a similar structure but using the heart disease features.

The user mentioned that if there are placeholders for thresholds, I should fill them with meaningful values. Since there's no specific decision tree provided, I need to come up with a plausible decision tree structure based on common medical knowledge and the features given.

Let me think about which features are most important for predicting heart disease. Common factors include age, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, maximum heart rate, and ST depression during exercise. 

Starting with the root node, maybe a key feature like age. Older age might be a risk factor. Let's say age >= 50 as a threshold. Then, the next split could be based on chest pain type. For example, if the chest pain is typical angina (3), that might be a sign. Alternatively, looking at ST depression (oldpeak) which is a significant indicator. 

Alternatively, the first split could be on 'thalach' (maximum heart rate). Lower max heart rate during exercise might indicate issues. Or maybe 'exang' (exercise-induced angina) since if it's present (yes), that's a strong indicator.

Wait, let me think of a possible decision path. Let me structure this step by step. Let's try building a simple decision tree of depth 3 or so.

Root node: Maybe 'thalach' (max heart rate achieved). Suppose if the max heart rate is below a certain threshold, say 110 bpm, that's a risk. 

Then, if thalach <= 110, maybe the next split is on 'oldpeak' (ST depression). If oldpeak is high (like over 2), that's a sign of heart disease. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on 'age'. Let's see:

Root node: age >= 55. If yes, then check something else. Or perhaps 'sex', since males might have higher risk? But in the features, sex is encoded as male, female, but the actual encoding here is 0 for female? Wait, according to the features list, sex is encoded as male, female. Wait, looking back:

In the feature descriptions, 'sex: sex (male, female)', but in the keys, the feature name is 'sex', but the encoding is not given here. Wait the problem says the exact keys are provided. Wait in the keys, the 'sex' is listed, and the description says 'sex (male, female)'. Wait the problem says the encoding is important. Wait in the feature descriptions, it says: "sex: sex (male, female)". Wait, but the encoding isn't specified here. Wait looking at the problem's feature descriptions again:

Wait, the feature 'sex' is described as: "sex: sex (male, female)". But the exact encoding is not given here. Wait, in the features list, the keys include 'sex', and in the problem statement's example, they had 'gender' with 0=Female, 1=Male, 2=Other. But here, maybe the encoding for 'sex' is 0 for female and 1 for male? The problem's example shows that the encoding can be encoded as numbers. Since the problem's exact keys are given, perhaps the 'sex' is encoded as 0 and 1. Wait, but the problem's description of the features says:

Wait in the problem's feature descriptions, for 'sex', it's written as "sex: sex (male, female)". So perhaps the encoding is 0 for male and 1 for female? Wait no, not sure. Wait maybe the encoding is 1 for male and 0 for female? Because in many cases, male is 1, female 0. But since the problem didn't specify, this could be an issue. However, in the example given in the problem, the example used 'gender' with 0=Female, 1=Male. But here, perhaps 'sex' is similar. Wait but the problem says to pay close attention to the encoding. Since the problem's feature descriptions for 'sex' only say it's (male, female), but the exact encoding isn't given here. Wait the problem's exact keys are given as ['age', 'sex', 'chest_pain', etc.], and the target is 'target'. 

Wait the problem says "here is the target variable. Pay close attention to the target value encoding: target: patient has a heart disease or not (yes = 1, no = 0)". So the target is 1 for yes, 0 for no. But for the features, like 'sex', the encoding wasn't explicitly given. Wait the problem's description for 'sex' says "sex (male, female)" but perhaps in the actual data, it's encoded as 0 and 1. Wait, in the example given in the problem's example, the features had 'gender' with 0=Female, etc. So perhaps here, 'sex' is encoded as 0 for female and 1 for male. 

Alternatively, perhaps in the data, 'sex' is stored as 1 for male and 0 for female. Let me assume that 'sex' is 1 for male and 0 for female. That's a common encoding. 

Moving on. Let's try to think of a decision tree structure. Let me think of a possible path:

Root node: Let's choose 'thalach' (max heart rate). Suppose if thalach is less than or equal to 110, then proceed. 

Then, the next split could be on 'oldpeak' (ST depression). If oldpeak is greater than 1.5, that might indicate heart disease. 

Alternatively, another path. Let me think of a possible structure. Maybe first split on 'oldpeak' because it's a strong indicator. Suppose if oldpeak > 2. Then, another split on 'ca' (number of colored vessels). 

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on 'chest_pain'. For example, chest pain type of 'asymptomatic' (0) might be a higher risk. 

Alternatively, let's look for the most important features in heart disease prediction. Max heart rate, ST depression, chest pain type, etc. 

Alternatively, here's a possible decision tree:

Root node: 'thalach' <= 110. 

If yes (thalach <= 110), then check 'oldpeak' > 2.0. If yes, predict 1 (heart disease). 

If no (thalach > 110), then check 'sex' (male). If sex is male (1), then check 'exang' (exercise induced angina). 

Alternatively, another approach. Let me think of the example given in the problem. The example had a depth 2 tree with two nodes. So perhaps the user wants a similar structure here, maybe with a depth of 2 or 3. 

Alternatively, let's make a decision tree with three nodes (depth 2). 

First node: 'thalach' <= 110. 

Second node: if first node is true (thalach <=110), then check 'oldpeak' > 2.0. 

If both, predict 1. Else, check another condition. 

Alternatively, maybe the first node is 'oldpeak' > 2.0. 

Then, second node could be 'ca' (number of vessels colored) > 0. 

Wait, but I need to structure this as a tree. Let me think of an example structure. 

Let me try building a possible decision tree step by step. 

Root node: oldpeak > 1.5. 

If yes, then check 'slope' (slope of ST segment). For example, if slope is downsloping (1), predict 1. 

Alternatively, perhaps:

Root node: sex is male (1). 

If yes, then check 'thalach' <= 110. 

Hmm, but maybe this is getting too complex. Let me think of a simpler structure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on age >= 55. 

Then, if age >=55, check 'trestbps' (resting blood pressure) > 140. 

Alternatively, the first split is on 'chest_pain' being asymptomatic (0). 

Wait, according to the chest_pain encoding: chest_pain is 3 = Typical angina, 0 = Asymptomatic, 2 = Non-anginal, 1 = Atypical. So if chest_pain is 0 (asymptomatic), that might be a higher risk. 

Alternatively, another approach. Let me look up common decision tree splits for heart disease. Since I can't access external resources, I'll have to think. 

Suppose the root node is 'oldpeak' (ST depression induced by exercise). High ST depression (oldpeak > 2) is a strong indicator. 

Then, if oldpeak > 2, then check 'ca' (number of major vessels colored). If ca is 0, then maybe that's a higher risk. 

Alternatively, let's construct a decision tree with 3 nodes (depth 2):

Nodes[0] = (oldpeak > 2.0) 

If yes (nodes[0] is 1), then check nodes[1] = (slope == 1 (downsloping)). 

If both, predict 1. 

Alternatively, perhaps:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [0]*3  # assuming depth 2 has 3 nodes?

Wait the example given in the problem had depth 2 with 2 nodes. Wait the example was depth 2 (so two layers of splits?), but the nodes list was size 2. Wait in the example, the code had two nodes (nodes[0], nodes[1]), so perhaps depth 2 tree has two splits. Wait the depth is the number of splits from root to leaf. So a depth of 2 would mean the root has a split, then each child can have a split, making the maximum depth 2. So the number of nodes would be 3 (root, two children), but the example used a list of 2 elements. Hmm, maybe the nodes list represents the internal nodes. In a depth 2 tree, there are two internal nodes (root and first split's child). 

Hmm. The example given in the problem had a depth 2 decision tree with two nodes. Let's see their example's code:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["HbA1c_level"] <= 6.7
    nodes[1] = X["blood_glucose_level"] <= 210
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 1

return prediction, nodes

So here, depth 2, two internal nodes (the root and the next level). The nodes list has two elements. So for our problem, perhaps a similar approach. 

Let's try to make a decision tree with two splits (so two nodes in the list). 

First, choose a root node condition. Let's say 'thalach' <= 110. 

Then, if that's true, check another condition like 'oldpeak' > 2. 

Alternatively, first split on 'oldpeak' > 2.0. 

Let me proceed with the following structure:

Root node: oldpeak > 2.0 → nodes[0]

If yes, then the next node (node1) could be checking 'slope' (slope of ST segment). Since slope is encoded as 3 = upsloping, 2=flat, 1=downsloping. A downsloping (1) might be worse. 

So node1: slope == 1 → nodes[1]

Wait but the problem requires the node conditions to be boolean. So perhaps node1 is (slope == 1). 

Alternatively, the second condition could be 'ca' (number of vessels) < 1. 

Alternatively, let's make the second condition 'exang' (exercise-induced angina) is present (exang == 2, since the encoding is 1=no, 2=yes). 

So here's a possible decision tree:

nodes[0] = (oldpeak > 2.0)

nodes[1] = (exang == 2)

Then, the logic:

if nodes[0] is true (oldpeak>2):

    if nodes[1] is true (exang is yes):

        prediction = 1

    else:

        prediction = ?

Wait, maybe I need to structure it properly. Let me think through the conditions.

Alternatively, here's another approach:

Root node: oldpeak > 2.0 → nodes[0]

If yes (node0 is True):

    Then check if slope is downsloping (slope ==1 → nodes[1])

    If both, then predict 1.

Else, predict 0 or something else. 

Alternatively, the second condition could be on 'ca' (number of vessels). 

Wait, perhaps the second node is 'ca' < 1 (since if no vessels are colored, that's worse). 

Alternatively, maybe the second node is 'thal' (Thalassemia) being a fixed defect (1) or reversible (3). 

Alternatively, let me think of a possible structure where if the first condition (oldpeak >2) is met, then the next split is on 'slope'. 

Let me try writing this:

def predict(X):

    nodes = [0]*2

    nodes[0] = X['oldpeak'] > 2.0

    nodes[1] = X['slope'] == 1  # downsloping

    if nodes[0]:

        if nodes[1]:

            prediction = 1

        else:

            prediction = 0

    else:

        prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

Wait but this might not be accurate. Alternatively, maybe if oldpeak >2 and slope is downsloping, then higher risk (1). 

Alternatively, maybe the first node is 'oldpeak >1.5', then next node is 'ca ==0'.

Alternatively, let me think of another approach where the first split is on 'chest_pain' being asymptomatic (0). 

nodes[0] = (X['chest_pain'] == 0)

If yes, then maybe check 'thalach' <= 110 (nodes[1]). 

Then, if both, predict 1.

Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first node is 'thal' (Thalassemia) being fixed defect (1). 

nodes[0] = (X['thal'] == 1)

Then, next node could be 'exang' is present (2).

But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first node is 'ca' (number of vessels) being zero. 

nodes[0] = (X['ca'] == 0)

Then, the next node is 'oldpeak' > 2.0

Hmm. 

Alternatively, let's think of a decision tree that uses two features for prediction. 

Suppose the first condition is 'oldpeak' > 2.0 (nodes[0]) → high ST depression indicates heart disease. 

The second condition is 'slope' of ST segment being downsloping (slope ==1). 

Then, the prediction would be:

if oldpeak>2 and slope is downsloping → predict 1 (yes).

Else, predict 0.

Alternatively, the second condition could be 'exang' (exercise-induced angina) is present (exang ==2). 

So the code could be:

def predict(X):

    nodes = [0]*2

    nodes[0] = X['oldpeak'] > 2.0

    nodes[1] = X['exang'] == 2

    if nodes[0]:

        if nodes[1]:

            prediction = 1

        else:

            prediction = 0

    else:

        prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

But maybe this is too simplistic. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first node is 'age' >=55. 

nodes[0] = (X['age'] >=55)

Then, the second node could be 'thalach' <= 110 (nodes[1])

Then:

if age >=55 and thalach <=110 → predict 1.

Else, 0.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the first node is 'sex' (male) → 1 for male. 

nodes[0] = (X['sex'] ==1)

Then, next node could be 'oldpeak >2'

Thus:

if male and oldpeak>2 → predict 1.

Else, 0.

But maybe this is better. 

Alternatively, let me think of the following:

The first node is 'oldpeak > 2.0' (nodes[0])

The second node is 'ca' (number of vessels) ==0 → nodes[1]

Thus:

if oldpeak>2 and ca ==0 → predict 1.

Else, predict 0.

This might make sense. 

Alternatively, let me think of the example given in the problem. The example used two thresholds on continuous variables. 

So perhaps for our case, use two continuous variables. 

First node: 'oldpeak' > 2.0 → nodes[0]

Second node: 'thalach' <= 110 → nodes[1]

Then:

if both are true → predict 1.

Else, predict 0.

Alternatively, the prediction could be 1 if either condition is met. 

But the logic in the example was:

if node0 (HbA1c <=6.7):

    if node1 (blood glucose <=210): 0

    else: 1

else: 1.

So the structure is a binary decision tree with two nodes. 

Thus, for our problem, following the example's pattern, the first node is the first condition, and the second node is the second condition. 

Let me proceed with:

First condition (node0): oldpeak > 2.0

Second condition (node1): thalach <= 110

The logic would be:

if node0 (oldpeak>2):

    if node1 (thalach<=110): predict 1

    else: predict 0

else:

    predict 0

Wait, but maybe the prediction when node0 is true and node1 is true is 1. 

Alternatively, maybe when node0 is true and node1 is true, it's a higher risk. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first condition is oldpeak >2 → node0

Then, second condition is slope ==1 (downsloping)

Then:

if node0 and node1 → predict 1,

else, predict 0.

Thus, the code would be:

def predict(X):

    nodes = [0]*2

    nodes[0] = X['oldpeak'] > 2.0

    nodes[1] = X['slope'] == 1  # downsloping

    if nodes[0] and nodes[1]:

        prediction = 1

    else:

        prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

Wait but in the example, the code uses nested if statements. Let me structure it similarly:

def predict(X):

    nodes = [0]*2

    nodes[0] = X['oldpeak'] > 2.0

    nodes[1] = X['slope'] == 1

    if nodes[0]:

        if nodes[1]:

            prediction = 1

        else:

            prediction = 0

    else:

        prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

This way, if node0 is true (oldpeak>2), then check node1. 

This structure is similar to the example provided. 

Alternatively, perhaps the second condition is 'exang' ==2 (exercise-induced angina present):

nodes[1] = X['exang'] == 2

Thus:

def predict(X):

    nodes = [0]*2

    nodes[0] = X['oldpeak'] > 2.0

    nodes[1] = X['exang'] == 2

    if nodes[0]:

        if nodes[1]:

            prediction = 1

        else:

            prediction = 0

    else:

        prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

This might be a better approach as exercise-induced angina (exang) being present might be a strong indicator.

Alternatively, the first node is 'exang' ==2 (present), then second node could be 'oldpeak' >2.0. 

Thus:

nodes[0] = (exang ==2)

nodes[1] = (oldpeak>2.0)

Then:

if exang is present (nodes[0] is true):

    if oldpeak>2 → predict 1

    else → 0

else:

    0

Alternatively, this could be a valid structure. 

Alternatively, the first node could be 'ca' ==0 (no vessels colored):

nodes[0] = (X['ca'] ==0)

Then, nodes[1] is 'oldpeak>2.0'

Thus:

if ca is 0:

    if oldpeak>2 → predict 1

    else → 0

else:

    0

This might make sense because if no vessels are colored (ca=0) and high ST depression, then higher risk.

Alternatively, perhaps the first node is 'thal' == 3 (reversible defect). 

Hmm. 

Given the uncertainty, let's choose a structure that makes sense and uses two conditions from the features provided. 

Let me proceed with the following structure:

First condition (node0): oldpeak >2.0

Second condition (node1): exang is present (exang ==2)

Thus, the code is as follows:

def predict(X):

    nodes = [0]*2

    nodes[0] = X['oldpeak'] > 2.0

    nodes[1] = X['exang'] == 2

    if nodes[0]:

        if nodes[1]:

            prediction = 1

        else:

            prediction = 0

    else:

        prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

Alternatively, perhaps the prediction should be 1 in more cases. 

Alternatively, maybe:

if oldpeak>2 → predict 1

else:

    check exang. If exang is present, predict 1?

Wait, that might not follow the two-node structure. 

Alternatively, maybe the final prediction is 1 if either (oldpeak>2) or (exang is present and something else). 

But the structure must have two nodes and follow the example's nested if structure. 

Alternatively, let me choose the first node as 'thalach' <= 110, and second node as 'oldpeak' >2. 

Thus:

def predict(X):

    nodes = [0]*2

    nodes[0] = X['thalach'] <= 110

    nodes[1] = X['oldpeak'] > 2.0

    if nodes[0]:

        if nodes[1]:

            prediction = 1

        else:

            prediction = 0

    else:

        prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

This way, if thalach is low and oldpeak is high, predict 1. 

Alternatively, perhaps the prediction should be 1 if either condition is met. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first condition is 'age' >=55, and second is 'thalach' <=110.

But I think the first approach with oldpeak and exang is better since they are related to exercise stress test results, which are commonly used in heart disease prediction. 

Alternatively, maybe the first node is 'slope' of ST segment being downsloping (slope ==2?), but need to check the coding of slope. 

Assuming slope is coded as 1: upsloping, 2: flat, 3: downsloping. 

Thus, slope ==3 is downsloping. 

Therefore, nodes[1] = (X['slope'] ==3)

Thus:

def predict(X):

    nodes = [0]*2

    nodes[0] = X['oldpeak'] > 2.0

    nodes[1] = X['slope'] ==3

    if nodes[0]:

        if nodes[1]:

            prediction =1

        else:

            prediction =0

    else:

        prediction =0

    return prediction, nodes

But I need to pick one structure. Since the user hasn't provided specific data, I'll choose the first structure with oldpeak and exang.

Alternatively, to make it similar to the example's structure where the final prediction can also be 1 even if the second node is false, but in the example, it was:

if node0: if node1: 0 else:1

else: 1

So in that example, the first node (HbA1c) being below a threshold leads to checking the second node (blood glucose). If that is also below, predict 0, else predict 1. 

If the first node is above, then predict 1 regardless.

In our case, maybe the first node (oldpeak>2) being true, then check exang present (node1). If yes, predict 1, else predict 0. 

Alternatively, perhaps the other way around. 

Alternatively, let me choose the first node as 'ca' ==0 and second as 'oldpeak' >2. 

def predict(X):

    nodes = [0]*2

    nodes[0] = (X['ca'] ==0)

    nodes[1] = (X['oldpeak'] >2.0)

    if nodes[0]:

        if nodes[1]:

            prediction =1

        else:

            prediction =0

    else:

        prediction =0

    return prediction, nodes

This would mean if no vessels are colored (ca=0) and there's significant ST depression (oldpeak>2), predict heart disease.

This might be a reasonable approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the first node is 'thal' ==3 (reversible defect), and second node is 'exang' ==2.

Thus, if thal is reversible defect and exang is present → predict 1.

But without data, it's hard to know.

Alternatively, to align with common medical knowledge:

- ST depression during exercise (oldpeak) is a sign of ischemia.

- Exercise-induced angina (exang) is also a symptom.

Thus, combining these two might be a good predictor.

Thus, proceeding with the first structure:

First node: oldpeak >2 → if yes, then check exang.

If exang is present (node1), predict 1.

Else, predict 0.

Else (oldpeak <=2), predict 0.

This could work.

Alternatively, maybe the other way around:

First node: exang ==2 (presence of angina)

Second node: oldpeak>2

Thus:

if exang is present:

    if oldpeak>2 → predict1

    else → predict0

else:

    predict0

But this might also be reasonable.

Either way, the code structure is similar to the example. 

I'll proceed with the first approach where:

nodes[0] = oldpeak >2

nodes[1] = exang ==2

Thus, the code is as follows.
</think>

```python
def predict(X):
    nodes = [False, False]
    nodes[0] = X['oldpeak'] > 2.0
    nodes[1] = X['exang'] == 2
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function predicts heart disease based on two features: `oldpeak` (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest) and `exang` (exercise-induced angina). 

- **First Decision (Node 0):** Checks if the ST depression (`oldpeak`) is greater than 2.0. A higher value here suggests significant ischemia.
- **Second Decision (Node 1):** If the first condition is met, it then checks if exercise-induced angina (`exang`) is present (coded as 2). 

### Prediction Logic:
1. If **both** `oldpeak > 2.0` and `exang is present**, predict **1** (indicating possible heart disease).
2. If `oldpeak > 2.0` but no angina, predict **0**.
3. If `oldpeak ≤ 2.0`, predict **0** regardless of other factors.

This structure follows a nested decision path similar to the example provided, using thresholds on medical features to make a prediction.
