Okay, so I need to build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 using the provided features. The goal is to classify which boxer won each round, either Trinidad or de la Hoya. Let me start by understanding the problem and the given features.

First, looking at the example they gave with Iris dataset: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width. They built a tree where the first split is on petal width (<=0.80), leading to setosa. If it's more than 0.80, then it splits again on petal width (<=1.75) for versicolor and otherwise virginica.

Now, applying that approach to my problem: features are Judge, Official judge (yes/no), Round (1-12). The target is Trinidad or de la Hoya.

I need to decide which feature to split on first. Since the maximum depth is 2, I can only have two splits.

First, maybe "Official judge" makes sense because official judges might be more reliable in scoring. So, if a round was scored by an official judge, perhaps that's a strong indicator of who won.

If it's an official judge, then the next split could be on Round number. Maybe earlier rounds have different patterns than later rounds? Or maybe higher rounds are decisive.

Alternatively, using Judge as the first feature might not capture enough because there are multiple judges and their tendencies might vary.

Wait, but the example used petal width twice, so perhaps in this case, I can use "Official judge" as the first split. So:

First node: Official judge (yes/no).

If yes, then maybe the next split could be on Round. For example, if Round <=6, Trinidad won; else de la Hoya.

But wait, that might not make sense because rounds are sequential and outcomes can vary per round regardless of being early or late.

Alternatively, maybe if it's an official judge, we look at whether they're HBO-Lederman, which is a known credible source, but that complicates the tree beyond depth 2.

Wait, the user wants maximum depth of 2, so only two splits. So after splitting on "Official judge", I can split again on something else, maybe Round or Judge.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split should be on "Judge" being HBO-Lederman or not because they might have a tendency towards one boxer.

But without knowing each judge's bias, it's hard to say. Alternatively, using "Round" as the first split: if round is early (1-6), maybe Trinidad was stronger, and later rounds de la Hoya. But that seems arbitrary.

Wait, but in the example, they used the same feature twice because petal width was the most important. Maybe here, "Official judge" is yes or no, so first split: if Official judge is yes, then next split could be on Judge being HBO-Lederman or not.

Alternatively, maybe Round number as the second split after Official judge.

But I'm overcomplicating. Let me structure it:

Decision Tree:
|- Official (yes)
  |- Round <=6 → Trinidad
  |- Round >6 → de la Hoya

Wait, but that's depth 2. The first split is Official yes/no, then within each branch, another split on Round.

But I'm not sure if this accurately classifies the winners. Maybe it's better to first split on Judge being HBO-Lederman since they might have a certain tendency, and then split on whether they're an official judge or not.

Alternatively, perhaps the tree should be:

|- HBO-Lederman (Judge)
  |- Official: yes → Trinidad
  |- Official: no → de la Hoya

But that's depth 2 as well. However, I'm not sure if HBO-Lederman is a feature; in the given features, Judge includes HBO-Lederman as one of the options.

Wait, the user lists "Judge" as a feature with possible values including HBO-Lederman among others. So maybe using "Judge" as the first split: if it's HBO-Lederman, then check something else.

But without knowing each judge's tendencies towards Trinidad or de la Hoya, this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps using Round as the first split. For example:

|- Round <=6 → Trinidad
|- Round >6 → de la Hoya

But that's only depth 1. To make it depth 2, I could have another condition within each branch, but maybe based on whether it's an official judge.

Wait, but the user wants a maximum depth of 2, so two splits. So perhaps:

First split: Official (yes/no)
Second split within each: Round <=6 or >6

But then how does that classify? For example:

If Official is yes and Round <=6 → Trinidad
If Official is yes and Round >6 → de la Hoya
If Official is no and Round <=6 → ?
If Official is no and Round >6 → ?

Wait, but without knowing the data distribution, it's hard to assign classes. Maybe I need to make assumptions.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on "Judge" being HBO-Lederman or not, since that might be a significant feature.

So:

Decision Tree:
|- Judge == HBO-Lederman
  |- Round <=6 → Trinidad
  |- Round >6 → de la Hoya

But again, without data, this is arbitrary. Alternatively, the first split could be on "Official" yes/no, and then within each branch, split on whether the round is early or late.

I think that's a plausible approach.
</think>

Decision Tree:

|--- Official (yes)
  |--- Round <=6 → Trinidad
  |--- Round >6 → de la Hoya

This tree uses "Official" as the first split and then considers the round number to classify the winner, assuming official judges might have different tendencies in earlier versus later rounds.

Okay, so I need to create a Python function that predicts which boxer won a round based on the given features. The decision tree should have a maximum depth of 2 and use the most important features. From the example provided earlier, it looks like "Official" and "Round" are the key features used in the tree.

First, I'll look at the features available: Judge, Official, Round, Target variable, and target. But for the decision tree, we're focusing on Official and Round since they were used in the previous example.

The target variable is whether Trinidad (0) or de la Hoya (1) won the round. So, I need to structure the function to return a prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

I remember that in the decision tree, if "Official" is yes, then it checks the Round. If Round <=6, Trinidad wins; otherwise, de la Hoya wins. So I'll set up the conditions accordingly.

Now, mapping this into Python code, I'll have to extract the values of "Official" and "Round" from the input dictionary X. Since Official is encoded as 1 for Yes and 0 for No, I can directly use it in a condition.

I'll create two nodes: one for whether Official is 1 (Yes) and another for Round <=6. Then, based on these conditions, determine the prediction.

Testing with some examples would help ensure accuracy. For instance, if "Official" is Yes and Round is 5, Trinidad should win (0). If Round is 7, de la Hoya wins (1). Also, if Official is No, I need to see how it's handled, but in the current tree, it doesn't specify, so maybe default to one of the boxers.

I think that covers setting up the function with conditions based on the decision tree and returning the prediction along with the node truth values.

Here’s a Python function implementing the decision tree you described. The function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features as input and returns both the predicted outcome (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and a list of binary values representing the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes with None (we have two inner nodes)
    nodes = [None, None]
    
    # First split: Official == 1 (Yes)
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Second split: Round <= 6
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
    else:
        # If not official, default to de la Hoya (you can adjust this logic as needed)
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **Nodes**: The list `nodes` contains boolean values representing the decisions made at each inner node of the tree.
  - `nodes[0]`: Indicates whether the "Official" feature is equal to 1 (Yes).
  - `nodes[1]`: Indicates whether the "Round" number is less than or equal to 6.

- **Prediction**: The final prediction is based on the path taken through the decision tree:
  - If the judge is an official judge (`nodes[0]` is True), then:
    - If the round number is <= 6, Trinidad wins (prediction = 0).
    - If the round number is > 6, de la Hoya wins (prediction = 1).
  - If the judge is not an official judge (`nodes[0]` is False), we assume de la Hoya wins (you can adjust this logic as needed).

This function follows your decision tree structure and returns both the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes. You can further customize the default behavior when "Official" is 0 if you have additional rules or data to inform that case.
