Alright, so the user wants me to build a decision tree classifier using specific features. They provided an example with sepal and petal measurements, which I recognize as the Iris dataset. Now they're moving on to a different problem involving boxing rounds won by either Trinidad or de la Hoya.

First, let's look at the new features: Judge, Official judge (yes/no), and Round (1-12). The goal is to classify each round's winner based on these features with a maximum tree depth of 2. That means the tree can have at most two decision levels, so I need to choose the most important features carefully.

The user mentioned they want the tree built using the most important features. Since there are only three features, but one is categorical (Judge) and another is binary (Official judge), it makes sense to use these as potential splits.

I should consider which feature is more influential. The Official judge being 'yes' or 'no' might be significant because official judges could have a higher weight in deciding the round's outcome. So, maybe I'll split first based on whether the judge is an official one.

If it's yes, then the next level could be Round number. Rounds 1-6 are typically earlier, and fighters might start strong or conserve energy, while rounds 7-12 are later when stamina comes into play. So splitting at Round <=6 and >6 makes sense. If the round is early (<=6), Trinidad might have the edge, and in later rounds, de la Hoya might be more dominant.

If the Official judge is 'no', then perhaps the decision depends on which specific Judge it is. Some judges might favor one fighter over the other based on their scoring criteria or personal bias. So, I can split here into two groups: Judges A, B, C and Judges D, E, F. This way, if the judge is in the first group, Trinidad wins; otherwise, de la Hoya.

I need to ensure the tree doesn't exceed a depth of 2, so each path from root to leaf should be at most two decisions. I think this setup meets that requirement. It also uses the features effectively by prioritizing Official status and then Round or Judge, depending on the first split.

I should present the decision tree clearly, showing each condition and the corresponding class. This approach should help classify which fighter won each round based on the given features.

To build a decision tree classifier for determining which boxer (Trinidad or de la Hoya) won a round based on the provided features, I will use the most important features to create a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. The features available are:

1. **Judge** (G. Hamada / B. Logist / J. Roth / HBO-Lederman / Sportsticker / Los Angeles Times-Kawakami / USA Today / Associated Press / Las Vegas Review-Journal / Los Angeles Times-Springer / van de Wiele)
2. **Official judge** (yes / no)
3. **Round** (1 to 12)

Here is the decision tree:

```
|--- Official judge: yes
||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Round > 6
||||--- class: de la Hoya
|--- Official judge: no
||--- Judge in [G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth]
||||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Judge in [HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, USA Today, Associated Press, Las Vegas Review-Journal, Los Angeles Times-Springer, van de Wiele]
||||--- class: de la Hoya
```

### Explanation:
1. **Root Node**: The first split is based on whether the judge is an "Official judge" (yes / no). This feature is chosen because official judges are more likely to have a significant impact on the outcome of the round.
2. **First Child Node (Official judge: yes)**: If the judge is an official judge, the next split is based on the Round number. Rounds 1-6 are generally considered early rounds where Trinidad might have an advantage due to his aggressive fighting style, while rounds 7-12 are later rounds where de la Hoya might gain momentum.
3. **Second Child Node (Official judge: no)**: If the judge is not an official judge, the next split is based on the specific Judge. Certain judges may favor Trinidad or de la Hoya based on their judging criteria or biases.

This decision tree uses a maximum depth of 2 and leverages the most important features to classify which boxer won each round.

Okay, I need to help the user by formatting their decision tree as a Python function. The function should return both a single prediction and a list of truth values representing the inner nodes' conditions.

First, I'll look at the decision tree they provided. It has two main splits: one based on whether the judge is official and another based on the round number if the judge is official. If the judge isn't official, it splits based on specific judges favoring Trinidad or de la Hoya.

The target variable encoding is crucial here. The user specified that the target is 0 for Trinidad and 1 for de la Hoya. So, I need to map the predictions accordingly.

Next, I'll consider the features and their encodings:

- **Judge**: Ranges from 0 (G. Hamada) to 10 (van de Wiele).
- **Official**: 1 for Yes, 0 for No.
- **Round**: From 1 to 12.
  
The function needs to take a dictionary `X` with these keys. I'll need to extract the relevant values from this dictionary.

For the first split, if "Official" is 1, then check if the round is less than or equal to 6. This determines whether Trinidad (0) or de la Hoya (1) won. If "Official" is 0, then determine based on the judge's ID: if it's among certain values (e.g., 0-2), predict Trinidad; otherwise, de la Hoya.

I also need to create a list `nodes` that tracks whether each inner node condition was met. The first element corresponds to "Official" being 1 and round <=6, the second to "Judge" being in [0,1,2].

Finally, I'll structure the function to return both the prediction and the nodes list. I must ensure the conditions are correctly implemented and that the threshold values align with the user's decision tree.

Testing this function with sample data would help verify its correctness, but since I can't run code here, I'll make sure the logic is sound based on the provided information.

Hereâ€™s a Python function representing your decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split: whether the judge is official
    if X["Official"] == 1:
        nodes[0] = True
        # Second split: round number
        if X["Round"] <= 6:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins (0)
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins (1)
    else:
        nodes[0] = False
        # Second split: specific judges favoring Trinidad or de la Hoya
        if X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2]:  # G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins (0)
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins (1)
    
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

This function works as follows:
- The first split checks if the judge is official (`X["Official"] == 1`). If true, it proceeds to check whether the round number is less than or equal to 6.
- If the round number is <=6, Trinidad wins (0). Otherwise, de la Hoya wins (1).
- If the judge is not official (`X["Official"] == 0`), it checks whether the judge is one of G. Hamada, B. Logist, or J. Roth (`X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2]`). If true, Trinidad wins (0). Otherwise, de la Hoya wins (1).

The `nodes` list contains:
- `nodes[0]`: Whether the condition for the first inner node (judge is official) was satisfied.
- `nodes[1]`: Whether the condition for the second inner node (round <=6) was satisfied.

Both entries in the list are 1 if the corresponding condition is true and 0 otherwise.
