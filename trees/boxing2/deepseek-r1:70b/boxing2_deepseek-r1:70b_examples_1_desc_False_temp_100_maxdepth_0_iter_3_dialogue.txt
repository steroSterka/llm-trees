Alright, so the user wants me to build a decision tree classifier using certain features to determine which boxer won each round between Trinidad and De La Hoya. They provided an example with sepal and petal measurements leading to species classification, and now they've given a new set of features related to boxing judges.

First, I need to understand the features they provided: Judge (with several names), Official judge (yes/no), Round (1-12). The target is to classify whether Trinidad or De La Hoya won each round. 

I should start by considering which feature would be the most important. In their example, petal width was the primary splitter, so maybe I can find an analogous feature here. The "Official judge" seems like a strong candidate because official judges' scores are more reliable and standardized.

So, I'll make the first split based on whether the judge is official or not. If it's yes, then I can rely on their decision as the primary factor for classification. That makes sense because official judges are trained professionals whose opinions are more consistent and credible.

If the judge isn't official, then maybe the next most important feature would be who the judge is. Different journalists or organizations might have biases or different judging criteria. For example, HBO-Lederman or Sportsticker might lean towards one fighter based on their style preferences. So, in this case, I can split further based on the specific judge's identity.

I'll choose a few prominent judges to create branches. Each branch would lead directly to the class (either Trinidad or De La Hoya) because each of these judges might have a known tendency in their scoring. For example, HBO-Lederman could consistently favor Trinidad, while Sportsticker might lean towards De La Hoya.

I should make sure that this structure is clear and easy to follow, just like the example they provided with the Iris dataset. The tree shouldn't be too complex but still capture the essential factors influencing the classification.

Finally, I'll format it as a decision tree using markdown, ensuring each node splits logically based on the features. This way, anyone reading it can understand how each round's winner is determined step by step.

Hereâ€™s a decision tree based on the provided features to classify which of the two boxing fighters (Trinidad / De La Hoya) won each round:

```
|--- Offical judge: yes
||--- class: Trinidad
|--- Offical judge: no
||--- Judge: HBO-Lederman
||||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Judge: Sportsticker
||||--- class: De La Hoya
||--- Judge: Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
||||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Judge: USA Today
||||--- class: De La Hoya
```

### Explanation:
1. The most important feature to classify the winner of a round is whether the judge is an "Official judge" (yes/no). Official judges are typically more neutral and reliable in their scoring.
2. If the judge is not an official judge, we look at specific judges' tendencies or biases. For example:
   - HBO-Lederman might favor Trinidad.
   - Sportsticker might favor De La Hoya.
   - Los Angeles Times-Kawakami might favor Trinidad.
   - USA Today might favor De La Hoya.

This decision tree assumes that the judges listed have specific tendencies in scoring, which is used to classify the winner of each round.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to create a Python function that predicts which boxer won a round based on the given features. The user has provided a decision tree structure and wants me to translate that into a function that returns both the prediction and a list of truth values representing the inner nodes' conditions.

First, let's understand the problem. We have features like 'Judge', 'Official', 'Round', and we need to classify whether Trinidad or De La Hoya won the round. The target variable is encoded as 0 for Trinidad and 1 for De La Hoya.

Looking at the decision tree provided earlier:

- It first checks if the judge is an official one.
- If yes, it classifies Trinidad as the winner.
- If no, then it looks at specific judges:
  - HBO-Lederman: Trinidad
  - Sportsticker: De La Hoya
  - Los Angeles Times-Kawakami: Trinidad
  - USA Today: De La Hoya

So, the tree has nodes based on 'Official' and then specific judges.

Now, to convert this into a Python function. I need to:

1. Read the input dictionary X which contains the features.
2. Evaluate each condition in the decision tree order.
3. Capture the truth values of these conditions in a list called nodes.
4. Based on the path taken through the tree, determine the prediction (0 or 1).
5. Return both the prediction and the nodes list.

I need to make sure that for each node in the tree, there's a corresponding entry in the nodes list indicating whether the condition was met (1) or not (0).

Starting with the first node: 'Official' status. If it's yes (1), then Trinidad wins.

If 'Official' is no (0), we move to check specific judges:
- HBO-Lederman (3)
- Sportsticker (4)
- Los Angeles Times-Kawakami (5)
- USA Today (6)

For each of these, if the Judge value matches, predict accordingly. If none match, perhaps there's a default case.

Now, coding this:

- Initialize nodes with five elements since there are four conditions to check beyond 'Official'.
- Evaluate 'Official' first.
- Depending on that, proceed to evaluate specific judges.
- For each condition met, set the corresponding node in the list to 1 or 0.
- Finally, return prediction and nodes.

I should also make sure to handle cases where none of the specified judges are present by defaulting to a prediction if needed. But according to the tree, it seems we cover specific cases, so maybe that's sufficient for now.

Testing with sample inputs would help ensure correctness, but since I'm just writing the function based on the provided structure, I'll proceed as instructed.
</think>

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree logic described above. The function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features and returns a prediction along with a list of truth values representing the conditions evaluated in the decision tree.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes to keep track of condition evaluations
    nodes = [None] * 5
    
    # First node: Check if the judge is official
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
    else:
        # Second node: Check if Judge is HBO-Lederman
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
        else:
            # Third node: Check if Judge is Sportsticker
            nodes[2] = X["Judge"] == 4
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # De La Hoya wins
            else:
                # Fourth node: Check if Judge is Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
                nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 5
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
                else:
                    # Fifth node: Check if Judge is USA Today
                    nodes[4] = X["Judge"] == 6
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # De La Hoya wins
                    else:
                        # If none of the specified judges, default to Trinidad (adjust as needed)
                        prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
    
    # Convert boolean values in nodes to 1 (True) or 0 (False)
    nodes = [1 if node else 0 for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes a list `nodes` with five elements, all set to `None`. This list will store the boolean evaluation of each condition as we traverse the decision tree.

2. **First Node**: The first condition checks if the judge is official (`X["Official"] == 1`). If true, Trinidad wins, and the prediction is set to 0. The result of this condition is stored in `nodes[0]`.

3. **Second Node**: If the judge is not official (`nodes[0]` is false), the function checks if the judge is HBO-Lederman (`X["Judge"] == 3`). If true, Trinidad wins (prediction = 0). The result is stored in `nodes[1]`.

4. **Third Node**: If HBO-Lederman is not the judge, the function checks if the judge is Sportsticker (`X["Judge"] == 4`). If true, De La Hoya wins (prediction = 1). The result is stored in `nodes[2]`.

5. **Fourth Node**: If Sportsticker is not the judge, the function checks if the judge is Los Angeles Times-Kawakami (`X["Judge"] == 5`). If true, Trinidad wins (prediction = 0). The result is stored in `nodes[3]`.

6. **Fifth Node**: If Los Angeles Times-Kawakami is not the judge, the function checks if the judge is USA Today (`X["Judge"] == 6`). If true, De La Hoya wins (prediction = 1). The result is stored in `nodes[4]`.

7. **Default Case**: If none of the specified judges match, the prediction defaults to Trinidad winning (prediction = 0).

8. **Conversion to Binary**: Finally, the boolean values in `nodes` are converted to binary (1 for True, 0 for False) before returning.

This function follows the decision tree logic precisely and returns both the predicted winner of the round and the evaluations of each condition in the tree.
