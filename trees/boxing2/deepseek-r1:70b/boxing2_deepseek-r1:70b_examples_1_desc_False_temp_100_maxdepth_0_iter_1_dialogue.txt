Okay, so I need to build a decision tree classifier to determine which boxer won each round between Trinidad and De La Hoya. The features provided are related to the judges of the fight. Let me start by understanding what these features mean.

First, there's the "Judge" feature, which lists several possible judges like G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth, HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, USA Today, Associated Press, Las Vegas Review-Journal, Los Angeles Times-Springer, and van de Wiele. I suppose each of these is a different judge who scored the rounds.

Next, there's "Official judge" which is either yes or no. This probably indicates whether the judge is an official judge for the fight or not. Official judges would be the ones whose scores actually count towards the official decision, while others might be unofficial sources like media outlets scoring the fight.

Then, there's the "Round" feature, which ranges from 1 to 12 since that's the typical number of rounds in a professional boxing match.

My goal is to classify each round as won by either Trinidad or De La Hoya based on these features. So I need to figure out how these judges' scores can predict who won each round.

Since decision trees work by splitting data based on features, I'll have to decide which feature is the most important for the first split and then proceed recursively.

First, I should consider "Official judge" because it's a binary feature (yes/no) that might be very influential. If the judge is an official one, their scoring might be more accurate or more indicative of who actually won the round compared to unofficial judges.

So the root node would split on "Official judge." For each branch, I'll need further splits.

For the "Yes" branch (official judges), perhaps the next feature could be the actual Judge name because different officials might have biases. But since that's a categorical feature with 11 possible values, it's too many to handle at once in a decision tree without overfitting. Alternatively, maybe we can group them or find another feature.

Wait, maybe after "Official judge = yes," I should look into the Round number because rounds can have different dynamics. For example, early rounds might be more feeling-out rounds, while later rounds could be more intense. However, without data on how each round was actually scored by each judge, it's hard to know.

Alternatively, maybe after "Official judge = yes," I should split based on the specific Judge. But with so many judges, that would create a lot of branches. Maybe instead, we can consider if there are any patterns among the judges. For example, some judges might consistently favor Trinidad or De La Hoya.

Wait, but without data on how each judge scored, it's hard to build an accurate tree. However, since this is a hypothetical exercise, I'll have to make assumptions.

Perhaps after "Official judge = yes," I can split based on the specific Judge. For example, if HBO-Lederman scored the round, maybe that indicates something about the round's outcome.

Alternatively, considering that Round number might be important because later rounds could be more decisive. Maybe Rounds 1-4 are considered early, 5-8 mid, and 9-12 late. But again, without knowing how each judge scores, this is speculative.

Wait, maybe I can combine "Official judge = yes" with the specific Judge's tendency. For instance, if HBO-Lederman is known to favor a certain style that Trinidad has, then when Official judge is yes and the judge is HBO-Lederman, classify as Trinidad. Similarly for others.

But again, without actual data on how each judge scored or their tendencies, this is difficult. So perhaps I need another approach.

Alternatively, maybe after "Official judge = yes," I can use Round to split further. For example, if it's an early round (1-4), and the judge is official, then classify as Trinidad. If mid rounds (5-8), De La Hoya. Late rounds (9-12), Trinidad again.

But this is arbitrary without data. Alternatively, perhaps I can think that in later rounds, fighters might tire, so if a fighter has more stamina, they might win more late rounds. But since both are top boxers, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the number of official judges matters. If multiple officials scored the round for one fighter, that could indicate the winner. But I don't have that feature here; each instance is per judge.

Wait, perhaps each row in the dataset represents a specific round and a specific judge's score. So for each round, there might be multiple entries from different judges. In that case, maybe we need to aggregate the scores across official judges to determine the winner of the round.

But since I'm building a decision tree per instance (per judge's evaluation), perhaps it's better to use the "Official judge" feature as the first split because an official judge's score is more reliable than an unofficial one. Then, for each branch, decide based on the Round number or specific Judge.

Alternatively, maybe after splitting on "Official judge," we can consider that official judges are more accurate, so if a round was scored by an official judge, it's more likely to reflect the true winner. But I still need a way to determine who won based on their scoring, which isn't provided here.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should structure it as follows:

Root: Official judge (yes/no)
- If yes:
  - Split on Round number (early vs mid vs late)
    - Early rounds: Trinidad
    - Mid rounds: De La Hoya
    - Late rounds: Trinidad
- If no (unofficial):
  - Maybe default to Trinidad or consider specific Judges

But this is speculative. Alternatively, maybe after "Official judge = yes," we can look at the Judge's identity. For example:

Root: Official judge (yes/no)
- If yes:
  - Split on Judge:
    - HBO-Lederman: De La Hoya
    - Sportsticker: Trinidad
    - etc.
- If no:
  - Default to Trinidad

But without knowing each judge's tendencies, this is just guessing.

Alternatively, perhaps the Round number could be the next split. For example:

Root: Official judge (yes/no)
- If yes:
  - Split on Round <=6: Trinidad
             >6: De La Hoya
- If no:
  - Default to Trinidad

But again, without data, this is arbitrary.

I think given the features provided, "Official judge" is the strongest because it indicates reliability. Then, within official judges, perhaps we can split based on Round number, assuming that later rounds might have been won by one fighter more than the other. Alternatively, maybe specific Judges are known to favor certain fighters.

But since I don't have actual data, I'll make an example tree using these features as best as I can.

To build a decision tree classifier for determining which boxer won each round between Trinidad and De La Hoya based on the given features, we proceed as follows:

### Decision Tree Structure:

1. **Root Node: Official Judge (yes/no)**
   - This is the primary split because official judges' scores are more reliable than unofficial ones.

2. **Left Branch (Official Judge = yes):**
   - Since these judges' scores are official and thus more indicative of the actual outcome, we further split based on the specific judge's identity.
     - For example:
       - HBO-Lederman: De La Hoya
       - Sportsticker: Trinidad
       - Other Judges: Assume Trinidad

3. **Right Branch (Official Judge = no):**
   - Unofficial judges may have different biases or scoring criteria, so we default to a conservative prediction.
     - Default classification: Trinidad

### Decision Tree:

```
|--- Official judge: yes
||--- HBO-Lederman: class: De La Hoya
||--- Sportsticker: class: Trinidad
||--- Other Judges: class: Trinidad
|--- Official judge: no
||--- class: Trinidad
```

This tree prioritizes the reliability of official judges and uses specific known or assumed tendencies of certain judges to classify round winners. Unofficial judges are treated with a default assumption due to potential variability in their scoring.

Okay, so I need to create a Python function that predicts which boxer won a round based on the given features. The decision tree is already structured, but now I have to translate it into code. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let's recap the decision tree structure:

1. **Root Node: Official Judge (yes/no)**
   - If "Official" is yes, we look at the specific judge.
   - If "Official" is no, we default to Trinidad winning.

2. **Left Branch (Official = Yes):**
   - Check the "Judge" feature:
     - HBO-Lederman (value 3) → De La Hoya wins.
     - Sportsticker (value 4) → Trinidad wins.
     - All other judges → Trinidad wins.

3. **Right Branch (Official = No):**
   - Default prediction: Trinidad wins.

So, the function needs to take a dictionary `X` with keys "Judge", "Official", and "Round". The target variable is whether Trinidad (0) or De La Hoya (1) won the round.

I need to represent this logic in Python. Let's outline the steps:

1. **Extract Features:**
   - Get the values for "Judge" and "Official" from the input dictionary `X`.

2. **Determine Prediction Logic:**
   - If "Official" is 1 (yes):
     - Check if "Judge" is HBO-Lederman (3) → predict De La Hoya.
     - Else if "Judge" is Sportsticker (4) → predict Trinidad.
     - For all other judges → predict Trinidad.
   - If "Official" is 0 (no) → default to Trinidad.

3. **Nodes Tracking:**
   - Create a list `nodes` where each element represents whether the condition of an inner node was satisfied (1 for True, 0 for False).

4. **Return Prediction and Nodes:**
   - Return both the predicted outcome and the nodes list as per the problem's requirements.

Let me think about potential issues:

- Ensure that all possible cases are covered in the if-elif structure.
- Handle the conversion of boolean conditions to integers (1 or 0) for the nodes list correctly.
- Make sure the function returns the correct data types: an integer for prediction and a list of integers for nodes.

Testing with sample inputs would help verify correctness. For example:

- If "Official" is yes and "Judge" is HBO-Lederman → prediction should be De La Hoya (1).
- If "Official" is no → prediction defaults to Trinidad (0).

Also, the nodes list should reflect which conditions were met in each step.

Now, I'll draft the code accordingly.
</think>

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree logic to predict which boxer won each round based on the given features:

```python
def predict(X: dict) -> tuple[int, list[int]]:
    # Extract necessary features
    judge = X["Judge"]
    is_official = X["Official"]

    nodes = [0] * 5

    if is_official == 1:
        nodes[0] = 1
        if judge == 3:  # HBO-Lederman predicts De La Hoya
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if judge == 4:  # Sportsticker predicts Trinidad
                prediction = 0
            else:  # Other judges default to Trinidad
                prediction = 0
    else:
        nodes[0] = 0
        prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Extract Features:**
   - The function begins by extracting the "Judge" and "Official" values from the input dictionary `X`.

2. **Initialize Nodes:**
   - A list `nodes` is initialized with 5 zeros to represent the truth values of inner nodes.

3. **Determine Prediction Logic:**
   - If the judge is official (`is_official == 1`), set the first node to 1.
     - Check if the judge is HBO-Lederman (value 3) and predict De La Hoya (1).
     - Else, check if the judge is Sportsticker (value 4) and predict Trinidad (0).
     - For all other judges, default to predicting Trinidad (0).
   - If the judge is not official (`is_official == 0`), set the first node to 0 and default the prediction to Trinidad (0).

4. **Return Prediction and Nodes:**
   - The function returns a tuple containing the predicted outcome as an integer and the `nodes` list with binary values indicating whether each condition was satisfied.

This implementation ensures that all specified conditions are checked in sequence, accurately reflecting the decision tree's logic and producing the correct prediction along with the corresponding nodes' truth values.
