Alright, so the user wants me to build a decision tree classifier using specific features to determine which boxer, Trinidad or de la Hoya, won each round. The features provided are Judge, Official judge (yes/no), and Round numbers from 1 to 12.

First, I need to understand the context. This is about a boxing match where rounds were scored by different judges. Each judge could be an official one or not, which might indicate their credibility or role in scoring. The goal is to classify each round as either won by Trinidad or de la Hoya based on these features.

Looking at the example given with the Iris dataset, the decision tree used petal width and length to classify the species. Similarly, I need to figure out how to use the given features effectively here.

I think about the importance of each feature:

1. **Judge**: There are multiple judges listed, like G. Hamada, B. Logist, etc. Each might have a bias or tendency in scoring, so their decisions could be consistent with either Trinidad or de la Hoya. However, without historical data on each judge's tendencies, it's hard to use this feature effectively.

2. **Official Judge (yes/no)**: This seems crucial because official judges are more likely to have their scores count towards the official result. So rounds scored by official judges might more accurately reflect who actually won that round.

3. **Round Number (1-12)**: The round number could indicate strategic changes in fighting styles. Early rounds might be feeling each other out, while later rounds could show stamina differences. But without knowing how each fighter performed in specific rounds, it's a bit abstract to use this as the primary feature.

Considering these points, I think the most logical approach is to first split based on whether the judge was official or not. Official judges' scores are more reliable. Then, for the non-official judges, perhaps considering the majority vote among them could help classify the round winner.

I'm a bit uncertain about how much weight to give each feature, especially since the Judge names don't have clear patterns without additional data. But given the information, focusing on Official Judge status makes sense as it's a binary and more reliable feature.

So, the decision tree would first check if the judge is official. If yes, their vote directly determines the class (Trinidad or de la Hoya). If no, then looking at multiple non-official judges might help, assuming they are consistent in their scoring trends.

Based on the features you provided (Judge, Official judge, and Round), I'll create a decision tree to classify which of the two boxing fighters (Trinidad / De La Hoya) won each round. The decision tree will be constructed based on the most important features.

Here’s the decision tree:

```
|--- Offical judge: yes
||--- Judge: HBO-Lederman
|||--- Round <= 6
|||||--- class: Trinidad
||||--- Round > 6
|||||--- class: De La Hoya
||--- Judge: Sportsticker
|||--- Round <= 4
|||||--- class: Trinidad
||||--- Round > 4
|||||--- class: De La Hoya
||--- Judge: Los Angeles Times-Kawakami / USA Today / Associated Press / Las Vegas Review-Journal / van de Wiele
|||--- class: Trinidad
|--- Offical judge: no
||--- Judge: G. Hamada / B. Logist / J. Roth
|||--- Round <= 3
|||||--- class: De La Hoya
||||--- Round > 3
|||||--- class: Trinidad
```

### Explanation:
1. **Offical judge**: This is the most important feature because official judges are more likely to have a significant impact on the outcome of the round.
2. **Judge**: Different judges may have different tendencies or biases, so this feature helps further refine the classification.
3. **Round**: The round number can indicate patterns in how fighters perform over time.

This decision tree prioritizes the official judge's assessment but also considers the specific judge and the round number for non-official judges to make a more accurate classification.

Alright, I need to help the user by formatting their decision tree as a Python function that returns both a prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes. Let's start by understanding what they've already provided.

They have a decision tree based on features like Judge, Official judge, and Round to classify whether Trinidad or De La Hoya won each round in a boxing match. The target variable is encoded as 0 for Trinidad and 1 for De La Hoya.

First, I need to map the features correctly. The 'Judge' feature has specific encodings from 0 to 10, corresponding to different judges. 'Official' is a binary feature (Yes/No), which is important because official judges have more weight. 'Round' ranges from 1 to 12.

The decision tree they provided uses these features in a hierarchical manner. It first checks if the judge is an official one, then looks at who the judge is, and finally considers the round number. So, I need to translate this hierarchy into conditional statements within the Python function.

Next, I have to create a list of nodes that track whether each condition was met (1 for true, 0 for false). Each node corresponds to an inner node in the decision tree. The order is crucial here; it should follow the structure of the tree accurately.

I'll start by defining the nodes based on the conditions:

1. Whether the judge is official.
2. Which specific judge it is among the officials.
3. For non-official judges, which ones are being considered.
4. The round number thresholds that determine the winner.

After setting up these conditions, I'll structure the if-else statements to reflect the decision tree's flow. This means checking each node in sequence and updating the prediction based on the path taken through the tree.

I also need to ensure that the function returns both the predicted outcome (0 or 1) and a list of the nodes' truth values in the correct order. Each condition check will update the corresponding node with 1 if true, 0 otherwise.

Testing this function with sample inputs would be helpful to verify its accuracy, but since I can't run it here, I'll make sure the logic aligns perfectly with the provided decision tree structure.

Finally, I'll format the code neatly, ensuring that variable names match the user's specifications and that the function is self-contained.
</think>

Here’s how we can implement the decision tree as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 6  # We need 6 nodes for this decision tree
    
    # Node 0: Offical == Yes (1)
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Node 1: Judge is HBO-Lederman (3) or Sportsticker (4) or Los Angeles Times-Kawakami (5) or USA Today (6) or Associated Press (7) or Las Vegas Review-Journal (8) or van de Wiele (10)
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10]
    
    # Node 2: Round <= 6
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    # Node 3: Round <= 4
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 4
    
    # Node 4: Round <= 3
    nodes[4] = X["Round"] <= 3
    
    # Node 5: Judge is G. Hamada (0), B. Logist (1), or J. Roth (2)
    nodes[5] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2]
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if X["Judge"] == 3:
            prediction = 0 if nodes[2] else 1
        elif X["Judge"] == 4:
            prediction = 0 if nodes[3] else 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[5]:
            prediction = 1 if nodes[4] else 0
        else:
            prediction = 0
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

### Explanation:
- The function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features.
- It initializes a list of `None` values to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
- Each condition in the decision tree is evaluated and stored in the corresponding node.
- Based on the hierarchical conditions, the final prediction is made.
- The function returns both the predicted class (0 for Trinidad, 1 for De La Hoya) and a list of binary values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
