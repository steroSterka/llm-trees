Based on the provided features, I will build a decision tree classifier to predict which boxer won each round. Here is the decision tree:

|--- Judge in ['Los Angeles Times-Kawakami', 'USA Today', 'Associated Press']
||--- Offical judge == 'yes'
|||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: Trinidad
|||--- Round > 6
||||--- class: de la Hoya
||--- Offical judge == 'no'
|||--- Judge in ['G. Hamada', 'B. Logist']
||||--- class: Trinidad
|||--- Judge not in ['G. Hamada', 'B. Logist']
||||--- class: de la Hoya
|--- Judge not in ['Los Angeles Times-Kawakami', 'USA Today', 'Associated Press']
||--- Round <= 4
|||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Round > 4
|||--- class: de la Hoya

This decision tree uses the following features:

1. Judge: This feature is used to split the data into two main groups. The judges 'Los Angeles Times-Kawakami', 'USA Today', and 'Associated Press' are grouped together, while the others are in a separate group.
2. Offical judge: This feature is used to further split the data within the first group.
3. Round: This feature is used to make predictions for both groups.

Note that this decision tree is not necessarily the only possible solution and may vary depending on the specific dataset and the desired level of complexity.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for predicting which boxer won each round:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Judge in ['Los Angeles Times-Kawakami', 'USA Today', 'Associated Press']
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [5, 6, 7]
    
    # Node 1: Official judge == 'yes'
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Node 2: Round <= 6
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    # Node 3: Judge in ['G. Hamada', 'B. Logist']
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1]
    
    # Node 4: Round > 4
    nodes[4] = X["Round"] > 4

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:
        if nodes[4]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    
    return prediction, nodes
```
This function takes a dictionary `X` with the feature values as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted class label (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
