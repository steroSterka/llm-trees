To induce a decision tree classifier based on the features you provided for classifying which of the two boxing fighters (Trinidad / de la Hoya) won each round, we'll need to consider the importance and relevance of each feature. Since I don't have actual data or results from the fight rounds, I will create a hypothetical decision tree based on logical assumptions about how these features could influence the outcome classification.

### Features:

1. **Judge**: The identity of the judge scoring the round.
2. **Official Judge (yes/no)**: Whether the judge is an official scorer for the bout.
3. **Round (1 to 12)**: The number of the round being scored.

Given these features, let's construct a hypothetical decision tree that could classify which fighter won each round. Please note, this example assumes that we're using a classification model where the target variable could be "Trinidad", "de la Hoya", or potentially "Draw" if applicable.

### Decision Tree:

|--- Official Judge (yes/no) == yes  
||--- Round <= 6  
|||--- Judge in {G. Hamada, B. Logist}  
||||--- class: Trinidad  
|||--- Judge not in {G. Hamada, B. Logist}  
||||--- class: de la Hoya  
||--- Round > 6  
|||--- Judge == HBO-Lederman  
||||--- class: Trinidad  
|||--- Judge != HBO-Lederman  
||||--- class: de la Hoya  

|--- Official Judge (yes/no) == no  
||--- Round <= 6  
|||--- Judge in {USA Today, Associated Press}  
||||--- class: de la Hoya  
|||--- Judge not in {USA Today, Associated Press}  
||||--- class: Trinidad  
||--- Round > 6  
|||--- Judge == Las Vegas Review-Journal  
||||--- class: de la Hoya  
|||--- Judge != Las Vegas Review-Journal  
||||--- class: Trinidad  

This decision tree is a hypothetical example and is based on the following assumptions:

- **Official Judges** have more influence over the scoring, so their opinions are used first.
- For early rounds (1-6), certain judges might lean towards one fighter due to perceived early round advantages or styles that appeal more to specific judges' scoring criteria.
- As the fight progresses (rounds 7-12), different judges might favor the opposite fighter based on factors like stamina, aggression in later rounds, etc.

### Note:
This decision tree is highly speculative and does not reflect actual outcomes or biases of real judges. In practice, building a decision tree would involve analyzing actual data from fights, considering the scoring patterns of various judges across multiple bouts, and possibly incorporating more nuanced features such as punch stats, knockdowns, and fouls.
=======
Based on the provided features, I will build a decision tree classifier to predict which boxer won each round. Here is the decision tree:

|--- Judge in ['Los Angeles Times-Kawakami', 'USA Today', 'Associated Press']
||--- Offical judge == 'yes'
|||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: Trinidad
|||--- Round > 6
||||--- class: de la Hoya
||--- Offical judge == 'no'
|||--- Judge in ['G. Hamada', 'B. Logist']
||||--- class: Trinidad
|||--- Judge not in ['G. Hamada', 'B. Logist']
||||--- class: de la Hoya
|--- Judge not in ['Los Angeles Times-Kawakami', 'USA Today', 'Associated Press']
||--- Round <= 4
|||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Round > 4
|||--- class: de la Hoya

This decision tree uses the following features:

1. Judge: This feature is used to split the data into two main groups. The judges 'Los Angeles Times-Kawakami', 'USA Today', and 'Associated Press' are grouped together, while the others are in a separate group.
2. Offical judge: This feature is used to further split the data within the first group.
3. Round: This feature is used to make predictions for both groups.

Note that this decision tree is not necessarily the only possible solution and may vary depending on the specific dataset and the desired level of complexity.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree based on the features and target variable you provided:


```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Official judge (yes/no)
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Node 1: Round <= 6
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    # Node 2: Judge in {G. Hamada, B. Logist}
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1]
    
    # Node 3: Judge == HBO-Lederman
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 3
    
    # Node 4: Judge in {USA Today, Associated Press}
    nodes[4] = X["Judge"] in [6, 7]
    
    # Node 5: Judge == Las Vegas Review-Journal
    nodes[5] = X["Judge"] == 8

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the features as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted target variable value (0 for Trinidad or 1 for de la Hoya) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The boolean values are converted to integers (0 or 1) before being returned.

Please note that this decision tree is based on the hypothetical assumptions made earlier, and you may need to adjust it according to your actual data and requirements.
