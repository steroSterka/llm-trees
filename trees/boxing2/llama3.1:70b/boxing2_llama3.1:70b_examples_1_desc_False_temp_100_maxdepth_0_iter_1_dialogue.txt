Based on the features you provided, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict which boxer won each round. Here's the decision tree:

|--- Judge: Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
||--- class: Trinidad
|--- Judge: not Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
||--- Offical judge: yes
|||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: de la Hoya
|||--- Round > 6
||||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Offical judge: no
|||--- Judge: USA Today / Associated Press / Las Vegas Review-Journal
||||--- class: de la Hoya
|||--- Judge: not (USA Today / Associated Press / Las Vegas Review-Journal)
||||--- Round <= 8
|||||--- class: de la Hoya
||||--- Round > 8
|||||--- class: Trinidad

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* If the judge is Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, the model predicts that Trinidad won the round.
* For other judges, if they are an official judge and the round is early (<= 6), the model predicts that de la Hoya won. If it's a later round (> 6), the model predicts that Trinidad won.
* For non-official judges, if they are from USA Today, Associated Press, or Las Vegas Review-Journal, the model predicts that de la Hoya won. Otherwise, if the round is early (<= 8), the model predicts that de la Hoya won, and if it's a later round (> 8), the model predicts that Trinidad won.

Please note that this decision tree is based on the features provided and might not be the optimal solution. The performance of the model can be improved by using more data or additional features.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 5  # Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1 and X["Round"] <= 6  # Official judge, Round <= 6
    nodes[2] = (X["Judge"] in [6, 7, 8]) and X["Official"] == 0  # USA Today / Associated Press / Las Vegas Review-Journal, Non-official judge
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] > 8

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        elif nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        elif nodes[3]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the features as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted target value (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
