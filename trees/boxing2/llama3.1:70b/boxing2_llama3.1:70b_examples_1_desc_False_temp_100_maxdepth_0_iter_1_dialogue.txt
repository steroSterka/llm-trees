Based on the features you provided, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict which boxer won each round. Here's the decision tree:

|--- Judge: Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
||--- class: Trinidad
|--- Judge: not Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
||--- Offical judge: yes
|||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: de la Hoya
|||--- Round > 6
||||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Offical judge: no
|||--- Judge: USA Today / Associated Press / Las Vegas Review-Journal
||||--- class: de la Hoya
|||--- Judge: not (USA Today / Associated Press / Las Vegas Review-Journal)
||||--- Round <= 8
|||||--- class: de la Hoya
||||--- Round > 8
|||||--- class: Trinidad

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* If the judge is Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, the model predicts that Trinidad won the round.
* For other judges, if they are an official judge and the round is early (<= 6), the model predicts that de la Hoya won. If it's a later round (> 6), the model predicts that Trinidad won.
* For non-official judges, if they are from USA Today, Associated Press, or Las Vegas Review-Journal, the model predicts that de la Hoya won. Otherwise, if the round is early (<= 8), the model predicts that de la Hoya won, and if it's a later round (> 8), the model predicts that Trinidad won.

Please note that this decision tree is based on the features provided and might not be the optimal solution. The performance of the model can be improved by using more data or additional features.

Based on the features you provided, I will build a decision tree classifier to predict which boxer won each round.

Here is the decision tree:

|--- Judge == HBO-Lederman
||--- class: Trinidad
|--- Judge != HBO-Lederman
||--- Official judge == yes
|||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: de la Hoya
||||--- Round > 6
|||||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Official judge == no
|||--- Judge in [Las Vegas Review-Journal, USA Today, Associated Press]
||||--- class: de la Hoya
||||--- Judge not in [Las Vegas Review-Journal, USA Today, Associated Press]
|||||--- class: Trinidad

Note that the tree is not as simple as the first example you provided, as there are more features and classes involved. I used a combination of feature values to build the decision tree.

Here's how I interpreted the features:

* HBO-Lederman was often biased towards Trinidad, so I made it a strong indicator for Trinidad winning.
* Official judges were more likely to score rounds correctly, so I prioritized their scores.
* In the early rounds (1-6), de la Hoya seemed to have an advantage, but in later rounds (7-12), Trinidad gained momentum.
* Certain judges, like Las Vegas Review-Journal, USA Today, and Associated Press, were more likely to score rounds in favor of de la Hoya.

Please note that this decision tree is not based on actual data or analysis, but rather a hypothetical interpretation of the features you provided. In real-world scenarios, it's essential to train decision trees using labeled datasets for accurate predictions.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
<<<<<<< HEAD
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 5  # Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1 and X["Round"] <= 6  # Official judge, Round <= 6
    nodes[2] = (X["Judge"] in [6, 7, 8]) and X["Official"] == 0  # USA Today / Associated Press / Las Vegas Review-Journal, Non-official judge
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] > 8

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        elif nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        elif nodes[3]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the features as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted target value (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
=======
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official judge
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Early rounds
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] in [7, 8, 10]  # Las Vegas Review-Journal, USA Today, Associated Press, and van de Wiele
    nodes[4] = not (nodes[0] or nodes[1])  # Neither HBO-Lederman nor official judge

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    elif nodes[1]:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya in early rounds
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad in later rounds
    elif nodes[3]:
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya for specific judges
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad otherwise

    return prediction, [int(x) for x in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names (`Judge`, `Official`, `Round`) and the values are the corresponding feature values. The function returns a tuple containing the predicted class label (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.

Note that I used integer encoding for the `Judge` feature, as specified in your description. Also, I used the `in` operator to check if the judge is one of the specific judges mentioned in node 3.
