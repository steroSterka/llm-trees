Based on the features you provided, I will induce a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2. Since there are two classes (Trinidad and de la Hoya), I'll assume that's what we're trying to predict.

Here's the decision tree:

|--- Judge == HBO-Lederman
||--- class: de la Hoya
|--- Judge != HBO-Lederman
||--- Official judge == yes
|||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Official judge == no
|||--- class: de la Hoya

However, I must note that this tree might not be the most accurate or robust model, as it relies heavily on a single feature (HBO-Lederman) and doesn't take into account other potentially important features like Round.

To improve the model, let's consider an alternative tree:

|--- Round <= 6
||--- Judge == USA Today
|||--- class: de la Hoya
||--- Judge != USA Today
|||--- class: Trinidad
|--- Round > 6
||--- Official judge == yes
|||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Official judge == no
|||--- class: de la Hoya

This tree takes into account both the Round and Judge features, as well as the Official judge feature. However, please keep in mind that this is still a simplified example, and you may want to consider additional features or more complex models (e.g., random forests) for a real-world application.

Let me know if you'd like me to revise or expand on this decision tree!

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        if X["Official"]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
```

However, I realized that the original decision tree I provided earlier was not accurate. The function above is a revised version of the decision tree based on the features and target variable you provided.

Here's how it works:

* If the round is less than or equal to 6 (`nodes[0]`), then we check if the judge is HBO-Lederman (`nodes[1]`). If it is, we predict de la Hoya (1). Otherwise, we predict Trinidad (0).
* If the round is greater than 6, we check if the official judge is Yes or No. If it's Yes, we predict Trinidad (0). Otherwise, we predict de la Hoya (1).

The function returns a tuple containing the prediction (either 0 for Trinidad or 1 for de la Hoya) and the truth values of the inner nodes (`nodes`).
