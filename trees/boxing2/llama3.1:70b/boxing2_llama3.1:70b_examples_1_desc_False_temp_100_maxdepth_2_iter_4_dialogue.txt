Based on the features you provided, I will build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 to classify which boxing fighter (Trinidad or de la Hoya) won each round.

After analyzing the features, I found that the most important ones are:

1. Judge: This feature seems to be crucial in determining the winner of each round.
2. Round: The round number might also play a role in the classification.

Using these two features, I built a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2:
```
|--- Judge == 'G. Hamada' or Judge == 'B. Logist'
||--- class: Trinidad
|--- Judge != 'G. Hamada' and Judge != 'B. Logist'
||--- Round <= 6
|||--- class: de la Hoya
||--- Round > 6
|||--- class: Trinidad
```
Here's a brief explanation of the tree:

* If the judge is either G. Hamada or B. Logist, I classify the round as won by Trinidad.
* If the judge is not one of the above two, I check the round number:
	+ If it's 6 or earlier, I classify the round as won by de la Hoya.
	+ If it's later than 6, I classify the round as won by Trinidad.

Note that this decision tree is a simplified representation and may not accurately capture all the nuances of the data.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1]  # G. Hamada or B. Logist
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, which contains the feature values. It first evaluates the conditions of the inner nodes and stores the results in the `nodes` list. Then, it uses these results to make a prediction based on the decision tree.

Note that I used the encoded values for the "Judge" feature (0 = G. Hamada, 1 = B. Logist) directly in the condition. Also, I assumed that the target variable is encoded as 0 = Trinidad and 1 = de la Hoya, so I adjusted the prediction accordingly.

You can use this function to make predictions by passing a dictionary with the feature values, like this:
```python
X = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 5}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(prediction)  # Output: 0 (Trinidad)
print(nodes)  # Output: [True, True]
```
This would indicate that the decision tree predicts Trinidad as the winner of the round, and the conditions of both inner nodes are satisfied.
