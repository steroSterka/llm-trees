Based on the features you provided, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict which of the two boxing fighters (Trinidad or de la Hoya) won each round. Here's the resulting decision tree:

|--- Judge in {USA Today, Associated Press, Los Angeles Times-Kawakami}
||--- Round <= 6
|||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Round > 6
|||--- class: de la Hoya
|--- Judge not in {USA Today, Associated Press, Los Angeles Times-Kawakami}
||--- Offical judge == yes
|||--- Round <= 8
||||--- class: Trinidad
||||--- Round > 8
|||||--- class: de la Hoya
||--- Offical judge == no
|||--- Judge in {G. Hamada, J. Roth, HBO-Lederman}
||||--- class: Trinidad
|||--- Judge not in {G. Hamada, J. Roth, HBO-Lederman}
||||--- class: de la Hoya

This decision tree uses the most important features to classify which fighter won each round. The tree has a depth of 3 and uses the following features:

1. Judge (specifically, whether it's one of USA Today, Associated Press, or Los Angeles Times-Kawakami)
2. Round
3. Offical judge

Note that this is just one possible decision tree, and there may be other trees that perform equally well or better with these features.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [6, 7, 5]  # USA Today, Associated Press, Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 8
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official judge == Yes

    if nodes[0]:
        if X["Round"] <= 6:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[1]:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            if X["Judge"] in [0, 2, 3]:  # G. Hamada, J. Roth, HBO-Lederman
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya

    return prediction, nodes
```
This function takes a dictionary `X` with the features as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted class (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
