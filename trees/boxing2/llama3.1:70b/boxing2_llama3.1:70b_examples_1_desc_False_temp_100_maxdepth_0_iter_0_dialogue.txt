Based on the features you provided, I will build a decision tree classifier to predict which of the two boxing fighters (Trinidad or De La Hoya) won each round. Here is the decision tree:

|--- Judge: HBO-Lederman
||--- class: Trinidad
|--- Judge: not HBO-Lederman
||--- Offical judge: yes
|||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: De La Hoya
|||--- Round > 6
||||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Offical judge: no
|||--- Judge: USA Today / Associated Press / Las Vegas Review-Journal
||||--- class: De La Hoya
|||--- Judge: not (USA Today / Associated Press / Las Vegas Review-Journal)
||||--- Round <= 9
|||||--- class: De La Hoya
|||||--- Round > 9
|||||--- class: Trinidad

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

1. If the judge is HBO-Lederman, Trinidad wins the round.
2. If the judge is not HBO-Lederman and is an official judge, then:
	* If the round is early (<= 6), De La Hoya wins.
	* If the round is late (> 6), Trinidad wins.
3. If the judge is not an official judge, then:
	* If the judge is USA Today, Associated Press, or Las Vegas Review-Journal, De La Hoya wins.
	* Otherwise:
		+ If the round is early (<= 9), De La Hoya wins.
		+ If the round is late (> 9), Trinidad wins.

Note that this decision tree is based on a simple analysis of the features and may not be optimal. In practice, you would want to use more advanced techniques, such as cross-validation and pruning, to build a more accurate decision tree.
=======
Based on the features you provided, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict which of the two boxing fighters (Trinidad or de la Hoya) won each round. Here's the resulting decision tree:

|--- Judge in {USA Today, Associated Press, Los Angeles Times-Kawakami}
||--- Round <= 6
|||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Round > 6
|||--- class: de la Hoya
|--- Judge not in {USA Today, Associated Press, Los Angeles Times-Kawakami}
||--- Offical judge == yes
|||--- Round <= 8
||||--- class: Trinidad
||||--- Round > 8
|||||--- class: de la Hoya
||--- Offical judge == no
|||--- Judge in {G. Hamada, J. Roth, HBO-Lederman}
||||--- class: Trinidad
|||--- Judge not in {G. Hamada, J. Roth, HBO-Lederman}
||||--- class: de la Hoya

This decision tree uses the most important features to classify which fighter won each round. The tree has a depth of 3 and uses the following features:

1. Judge (specifically, whether it's one of USA Today, Associated Press, or Los Angeles Times-Kawakami)
2. Round
3. Offical judge

Note that this is just one possible decision tree, and there may be other trees that perform equally well or better with these features.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree based on the provided features:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Judge: HBO-Lederman (3) wins for Trinidad
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3
    
    # Official judge
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Early rounds (<= 6)
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    # USA Today, Associated Press, or Las Vegas Review-Journal judges win for de la Hoya
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] in [6, 7, 8]
    
    # Late rounds (> 9)
    nodes[4] = X["Round"] > 9
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # Official judge
            if nodes[2]:  # Early rounds
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
            else:  # Late rounds
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
        else:  # Not official judge
            if nodes[3]:  # USA Today, Associated Press, or Las Vegas Review-Journal judges
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
            else:
                if nodes[4]:  # Late rounds
                    prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
                else:  # Early rounds
                    prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values. The function returns a tuple containing the predicted class label (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and a list of truth values for each inner node in the decision tree.

        else:

                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya

    return prediction, nodes
```
This function takes a dictionary `X` with the features as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted class (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
