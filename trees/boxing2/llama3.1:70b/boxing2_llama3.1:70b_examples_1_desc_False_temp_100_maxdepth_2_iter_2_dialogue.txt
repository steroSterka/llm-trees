Based on the features you provided, I will build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 using the most important features. Please note that without actual data, I'll make some assumptions about the importance of features.

Here's the decision tree:

|--- Judge (G. Hamada / B. Logist)
||--- class: de la Hoya
|--- Judge != (G. Hamada / B. Logist)
||--- Offical judge == yes
|||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Offical judge != yes
|||--- class: de la Hoya

Here's a brief explanation of the tree:

* The first split is based on the Judge feature, which seems to be an important factor in determining the winner. Judges G. Hamada and B. Logist are assumed to have similar voting patterns, so I combined them into one node.
* For rounds judged by G. Hamada or B. Logist, de la Hoya is predicted to win (class: de la Hoya).
* For rounds judged by other judges, the next split is based on whether the judge is an official judge (Offical judge == yes). If they are, Trinidad is predicted to win (class: Trinidad).
* If the judge is not an official judge, de la Hoya is predicted to win (class: de la Hoya).

Please note that this decision tree is a simplified example and may not accurately reflect real-world data. The actual performance of the model would depend on the quality of the training data.

Also, I did not use the Round feature as it might introduce noise in the decision-making process with only two levels (Trinidad/de la Hoya). However, if you'd like to explore using the Round feature or adjusting the tree further, please let me know!

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1]
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

In this implementation:

*   We first initialize an empty list `nodes` with two elements to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
*   The first condition checks if the judge is either G. Hamada (0) or B. Logist (1). If true, we predict de la Hoya as the winner.
*   If the first condition is false, we check if the judge is an official judge. If true, we predict Trinidad as the winner; otherwise, we predict de la Hoya.

Note that I used `int(node)` to convert the boolean values in the `nodes` list to integers (0 or 1) before returning it.

You can call this function by passing a dictionary with the features as keys and their corresponding values. For example:

```python
X = {
    "Judge": 2,
    "Official": 1,
    "Round": 5
}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # 0 (Trinidad) or 1 (de la Hoya)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # [0, 1] or [1, 0]
```
