Based on the provided features, I'll build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 to classify which boxer won each round. Since there are two classes (Trinidad or de la Hoya), I'll use the Gini impurity criterion to determine the most important features.

Here's the decision tree:

|--- Judge: HBO-Lederman
||--- class: Trinidad
|--- Judge != HBO-Lederman
||--- Round <= 6
|||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Round > 6
|||--- class: de la Hoya

Explanation:

* The most important feature is the judge, specifically HBO-Lederman. If HBO-Lederman is the judge, it's likely that Trinidad won the round.
* For other judges, the next most important feature is the round number. Rounds 1-6 are more likely to be won by Trinidad, while rounds 7-12 are more likely to be won by de la Hoya.

Note that this decision tree is not necessarily optimal and might not accurately predict the outcome of each round. The actual performance of the tree depends on the specific data used for training.

Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values. The function uses these values to make predictions based on the decision tree.

The inner nodes are represented by the `nodes` list, which contains boolean values indicating whether each condition is satisfied (1) or not (0). The prediction is made based on these node values.

Note that I've used the encoded value for HBO-Lederman (3) and the threshold of 6 for the round number. If you need to adjust these values, please let me know!
