Based on the features you provided, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict which boxer won each round. Here's my attempt:

|--- Judge = USA Today
||--- class: Trinidad
|--- Judge ≠ USA Today
||--- Offical judge = yes
|||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: de la Hoya
|||--- Round > 6
||||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Offical judge = no
|||--- Judge = Associated Press / Las Vegas Review-Journal / Los Angeles Times-Springer / van de Wiele
||||--- class: Trinidad
|||--- Judge ≠ Associated Press / Las Vegas Review-Journal / Los Angeles Times-Springer / van de Wiele
||||--- Round <= 3
|||||--- class: de la Hoya
|||||--- Round > 3
|||||--- class: Trinidad

Here's a brief explanation of the tree:

1. If the judge is USA Today, I predict Trinidad wins the round.
2. If the judge is not USA Today and an official judge, I split on the round number:
	* Rounds 1-6: de la Hoya wins
	* Rounds 7-12: Trinidad wins
3. If the judge is not USA Today and not an official judge, I split on a subset of judges (Associated Press, Las Vegas Review-Journal, Los Angeles Times-Springer, van de Wiele):
	* These judges predict Trinidad wins
4. For other non-official judges, I split on round number:
	* Rounds 1-3: de la Hoya wins
	* Rounds 4-12: Trinidad wins

Please note that this decision tree is based solely on the features you provided and might not be optimal or reflect real-world data.

Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting which of the two boxing fighters won each round:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Judge == USA Today (6)
    nodes[0] = X['Judge'] == 6
    
    # Node 1: Official judge == Yes (1)
    nodes[1] = X['Official'] == 1
    
    # Node 2: Round <= 6
    nodes[2] = X['Round'] <= 6
    
    # Node 3: Judge in [Associated Press, Las Vegas Review-Journal, Los Angeles Times-Springer, van de Wiele]
    nodes[3] = X['Judge'] in [7, 8, 9, 10]
    
    # Node 4: Round <= 3
    nodes[4] = X['Round'] <= 3
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
    elif nodes[1]:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
    elif nodes[3]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
    elif nodes[4]:
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

In this function, the decision tree is implemented using a series of if-elif statements that mirror the structure of the tree. The `nodes` list stores the truth values of each inner node in the tree, and the final prediction is returned along with the `nodes` list.
