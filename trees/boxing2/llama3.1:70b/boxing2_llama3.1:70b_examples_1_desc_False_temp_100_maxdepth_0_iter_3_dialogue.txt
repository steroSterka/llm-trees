Based on the features you provided, I will build a decision tree classifier to predict which boxer won each round. Here is the tree:

|--- Judge: G. Hamada
||--- class: Trinidad
|--- Judge != G. Hamada
||--- Official judge: yes
|||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: de la Hoya
|||--- Round > 6
||||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Official judge: no
|||--- Judge: B. Logist / J. Roth / HBO-Lederman
||||--- class: Trinidad
|||--- Judge: Sportsticker / Los Angeles Times-Kawakami / USA Today / Associated Press / Las Vegas Review-Journal / Los Angeles Times-Springer / van de Wiele
||||--- Round <= 8
|||||--- class: de la Hoya
|||||--- Round > 8
||||||--- class: Trinidad

Note that the tree is not exhaustive, and there may be other possible trees. The feature importance was determined based on the number of times each feature appeared in the tree.

Here's a brief explanation of the decision-making process:

1. If Judge G. Hamada scored the round, it's more likely to be won by Trinidad.
2. If the judge is not G. Hamada and an official judge, rounds 1-6 are more likely to be won by de la Hoya, while rounds 7-12 are more likely to be won by Trinidad.
3. If the judge is not an official judge, judges B. Logist, J. Roth, and HBO-Lederman tend to score in favor of Trinidad.
4. For other judges (Sportsticker, Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, USA Today, Associated Press, Las Vegas Review-Journal, Los Angeles Times-Springer, and van de Wiele), rounds 1-8 are more likely to be won by de la Hoya, while rounds 9-12 are more likely to be won by Trinidad.

Keep in mind that this is a simple decision tree and may not capture all the complexities of the data.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 0  # G. Hamada
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official judge
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] in [1, 2, 3]  # B. Logist, J. Roth, HBO-Lederman
    nodes[4] = X["Round"] > 8

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    elif nodes[1]:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```
Note that I've used the exact keys and feature encodings provided. The function takes a dictionary `X` with the features as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted target value (0 or 1) and a list of binary values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

You can test this function with a sample input, for example:
```python
X = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 5}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(prediction)  # Output: 0 (Trinidad)
print(nodes)  # Output: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
```
