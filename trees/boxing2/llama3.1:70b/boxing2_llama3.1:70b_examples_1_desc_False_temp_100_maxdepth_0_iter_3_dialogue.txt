Based on the features you provided, I will build a decision tree classifier to predict which boxer won each round. Here is the tree:

|--- Judge: G. Hamada
||--- class: Trinidad
|--- Judge != G. Hamada
||--- Official judge: yes
=======
Based on the features you provided, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict which boxer won each round. Here's my attempt:

|--- Judge = USA Today
||--- class: Trinidad
|--- Judge ≠ USA Today
||--- Offical judge = yes
>>>>>>> main
|||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: de la Hoya
|||--- Round > 6
||||--- class: Trinidad
<<<<<<< HEAD
||--- Official judge: no
|||--- Judge: B. Logist / J. Roth / HBO-Lederman
||||--- class: Trinidad
|||--- Judge: Sportsticker / Los Angeles Times-Kawakami / USA Today / Associated Press / Las Vegas Review-Journal / Los Angeles Times-Springer / van de Wiele
||||--- Round <= 8
|||||--- class: de la Hoya
|||||--- Round > 8
||||||--- class: Trinidad

Note that the tree is not exhaustive, and there may be other possible trees. The feature importance was determined based on the number of times each feature appeared in the tree.

Here's a brief explanation of the decision-making process:

1. If Judge G. Hamada scored the round, it's more likely to be won by Trinidad.
2. If the judge is not G. Hamada and an official judge, rounds 1-6 are more likely to be won by de la Hoya, while rounds 7-12 are more likely to be won by Trinidad.
3. If the judge is not an official judge, judges B. Logist, J. Roth, and HBO-Lederman tend to score in favor of Trinidad.
4. For other judges (Sportsticker, Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, USA Today, Associated Press, Las Vegas Review-Journal, Los Angeles Times-Springer, and van de Wiele), rounds 1-8 are more likely to be won by de la Hoya, while rounds 9-12 are more likely to be won by Trinidad.

Keep in mind that this is a simple decision tree and may not capture all the complexities of the data.
=======
||--- Offical judge = no
|||--- Judge = Associated Press / Las Vegas Review-Journal / Los Angeles Times-Springer / van de Wiele
||||--- class: Trinidad
|||--- Judge ≠ Associated Press / Las Vegas Review-Journal / Los Angeles Times-Springer / van de Wiele
||||--- Round <= 3
|||||--- class: de la Hoya
|||||--- Round > 3
|||||--- class: Trinidad

Here's a brief explanation of the tree:

1. If the judge is USA Today, I predict Trinidad wins the round.
2. If the judge is not USA Today and an official judge, I split on the round number:
	* Rounds 1-6: de la Hoya wins
	* Rounds 7-12: Trinidad wins
3. If the judge is not USA Today and not an official judge, I split on a subset of judges (Associated Press, Las Vegas Review-Journal, Los Angeles Times-Springer, van de Wiele):
	* These judges predict Trinidad wins
4. For other non-official judges, I split on round number:
	* Rounds 1-3: de la Hoya wins
	* Rounds 4-12: Trinidad wins

Please note that this decision tree is based solely on the features you provided and might not be optimal or reflect real-world data.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 0  # G. Hamada
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official judge
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] in [1, 2, 3]  # B. Logist, J. Roth, HBO-Lederman
    nodes[4] = X["Round"] > 8

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    elif nodes[1]:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```
Note that I've used the exact keys and feature encodings provided. The function takes a dictionary `X` with the features as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted target value (0 or 1) and a list of binary values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

You can test this function with a sample input, for example:
```python
X = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 5}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(prediction)  # Output: 0 (Trinidad)
print(nodes)  # Output: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
```

Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting which of the two boxing fighters won each round:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Judge == USA Today (6)
    nodes[0] = X['Judge'] == 6
    
    # Node 1: Official judge == Yes (1)
    nodes[1] = X['Official'] == 1
    
    # Node 2: Round <= 6
    nodes[2] = X['Round'] <= 6
    
    # Node 3: Judge in [Associated Press, Las Vegas Review-Journal, Los Angeles Times-Springer, van de Wiele]
    nodes[3] = X['Judge'] in [7, 8, 9, 10]
    
    # Node 4: Round <= 3
    nodes[4] = X['Round'] <= 3
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
    elif nodes[1]:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
    elif nodes[3]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
    elif nodes[4]:
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

In this function, the decision tree is implemented using a series of if-elif statements that mirror the structure of the tree. The `nodes` list stores the truth values of each inner node in the tree, and the final prediction is returned along with the `nodes` list.
