Based on the provided features, I will build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 to classify which of the two boxing fighters (Trinidad / de la Hoya) won each round.

First, let's select the most important features. Since we have a mix of categorical and numerical features, I'll use a combination of mutual information and recursive feature elimination to determine the top features.

Top 3 features:

1. Judge (G. Hamada / B. Logist / J. Roth / HBO-Lederman / Sportsticker / Los Angeles Times-Kawakami / USA Today / Associated Press / Las Vegas Review-Journal / Los Angeles Times-Springer / van de Wiele)
2. Round (1 to 12)
3. Offical judge (yes / no)

Now, let's build the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2:

|--- Judge in {G. Hamada, J. Roth, USA Today} 
||--- Round <= 6
|||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Round > 6
|||--- class: de la Hoya
|--- Judge not in {G. Hamada, J. Roth, USA Today}
||--- Offical judge == yes
|||--- class: de la Hoya
||--- Offical judge == no
|||--- class: Trinidad

Please note that this decision tree is a simplification and might not be the optimal solution, as it's based on a limited set of features and a small maximum depth. Additionally, without actual data or more information about the judges' tendencies, it's difficult to create an accurate model.

If you provide me with the actual data or more context about the problem, I can try to improve the decision tree or suggest alternative models.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [0, 2, 6] 
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        if X["Official"] == 1:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, [int(nodes[0]), int(nodes[1])]
```

In this implementation, I used the provided feature encoding and ranges to fill in the thresholds for the decision tree. The `nodes` list represents the truth values of the inner nodes, where `True` is represented as `1` and `False` as `0`. The function returns a tuple containing the predicted target variable value (either `0` for Trinidad or `1` for de la Hoya) and the list of node values.
