I'll induce a decision tree classifier based on the provided features.

First, I need to understand the target variable. In this case, it's which of the two boxing fighters (Trinidad or de la Hoya) won each round. Let's assume we have a binary target variable: `Winner` = {Trinidad, de la Hoya}.

Next, I'll analyze the features:

1. `Judge`: This feature has multiple categories, but it might not be the most informative feature on its own.
2. `Offical judge`: This feature is more promising, as it distinguishes between official and non-official judges.
3. `Round`: The round number could be an important factor in determining the winner.

Now, let's induce a decision tree using these features:

|--- Offical judge = yes
||--- Round <= 6
|||--- Winner: Trinidad
||--- Round > 6
|||--- Winner: de la Hoya
|--- Offical judge = no
||--- Judge in {HBO-Lederman, USA Today, Associated Press}
|||--- Winner: de la Hoya
||--- Judge not in {HBO-Lederman, USA Today, Associated Press}
|||--- Round <= 9
||||--- Winner: Trinidad
||||--- Round > 9
|||||--- Winner: de la Hoya

This decision tree uses the `Offical judge` feature as the top-level split. If the judge is an official one, the tree looks at the round number to determine the winner. For non-official judges, it checks if the judge belongs to a specific set (HBO-Lederman, USA Today, Associated Press) and then uses the round number to make a decision.

Please note that this decision tree might not be optimal or accurate without actual data to train on.
=======
Based on the features you provided, I will build a decision tree classifier to predict which boxer won each round. Since there are two possible outcomes (Trinidad or de la Hoya), I'll use a binary classification approach.

After analyzing the features, I selected the most important ones for the decision tree:

* Judge: This feature has a high impact on the outcome, as different judges may have varying opinions.
* Round: The round number can influence the fighters' strategies and energy levels.
* Official judge: Although not all judges are official, this feature might add some weight to the decision.

Here's the induced decision tree:
```
|--- Judge in [G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth]
||--- Round <= 6
|||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Round > 6
|||--- class: de la Hoya
|--- Judge in [HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, USA Today]
||--- Official judge == yes
|||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Official judge == no
|||--- Round <= 9
||||--- class: Trinidad
||||--- Round > 9
|||||--- class: de la Hoya
|--- Judge in [Associated Press, Las Vegas Review-Journal, Los Angeles Times-Springer, van de Wiele]
||--- Round <= 3
|||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Round > 3
|||--- Official judge == yes
||||--- class: Trinidad
||||--- Official judge == no
|||||--- class: de la Hoya
```
This decision tree uses the Judge feature as the primary splitter, followed by Round and Official judge. The tree has a mix of both simple and composite conditions to classify each round.

Keep in mind that this is just one possible decision tree, and there may be other valid trees depending on the specific dataset and weights assigned to each feature.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
<<<<<<< HEAD
    # Check if Official judge is Yes (1)
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # If Official judge is Yes, check Round <= 6
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    # If Official judge is No, check Judge in {HBO-Lederman, USA Today, Associated Press}
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] in [3, 6, 7]
    
    # If Judge not in {HBO-Lederman, USA Today, Associated Press}, check Round <= 9
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 9
    
    # Check Round > 9 (only if Official judge is No and Judge not in {HBO-Lederman, USA Today, Associated Press})
    nodes[4] = X["Round"] > 9

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1
        elif nodes[3]:
            prediction = 0
        elif nodes[4]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # Default case (should not happen)
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the features as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted class label (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
=======
    # Check Judge in [G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] < 3
    
    # Check Round <= 6 for node 0
    nodes[1] = (nodes[0]) and (X["Round"] <= 6)
    
    # Check Official judge == yes for other judges
    nodes[2] = (not nodes[0]) and X["Official"]
    
    # Check Round > 9 for node 3
    nodes[3] = (not nodes[0]) and (not nodes[2]) and (X["Round"] > 9)
    
    # Check Judge in [Associated Press, Las Vegas Review-Journal, Los Angeles Times-Springer, van de Wiele]
    nodes[4] = X["Judge"] >= 7
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = int(not nodes[1])
    elif nodes[2]:
        prediction = 0
    else:
        prediction = int(nodes[3]) ^ (nodes[4] and (X["Round"] <= 3))
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function uses the same logic as the decision tree I provided earlier. It checks each condition and assigns a value to the `prediction` variable based on the outcome of those conditions. The function also returns a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Note that I used bitwise XOR (`^`) operator in the last line to simplify the logic. This operator returns 1 if one of its operands is 1 and the other is 0, which matches the behavior described in the decision tree.
