I'll induce a decision tree classifier based on the provided features.

First, I need to understand the target variable. In this case, it's which of the two boxing fighters (Trinidad or de la Hoya) won each round. Let's assume we have a binary target variable: `Winner` = {Trinidad, de la Hoya}.

Next, I'll analyze the features:

1. `Judge`: This feature has multiple categories, but it might not be the most informative feature on its own.
2. `Offical judge`: This feature is more promising, as it distinguishes between official and non-official judges.
3. `Round`: The round number could be an important factor in determining the winner.

Now, let's induce a decision tree using these features:

|--- Offical judge = yes
||--- Round <= 6
|||--- Winner: Trinidad
||--- Round > 6
|||--- Winner: de la Hoya
|--- Offical judge = no
||--- Judge in {HBO-Lederman, USA Today, Associated Press}
|||--- Winner: de la Hoya
||--- Judge not in {HBO-Lederman, USA Today, Associated Press}
|||--- Round <= 9
||||--- Winner: Trinidad
||||--- Round > 9
|||||--- Winner: de la Hoya

This decision tree uses the `Offical judge` feature as the top-level split. If the judge is an official one, the tree looks at the round number to determine the winner. For non-official judges, it checks if the judge belongs to a specific set (HBO-Lederman, USA Today, Associated Press) and then uses the round number to make a decision.

Please note that this decision tree might not be optimal or accurate without actual data to train on.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Check if Official judge is Yes (1)
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # If Official judge is Yes, check Round <= 6
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    # If Official judge is No, check Judge in {HBO-Lederman, USA Today, Associated Press}
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] in [3, 6, 7]
    
    # If Judge not in {HBO-Lederman, USA Today, Associated Press}, check Round <= 9
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 9
    
    # Check Round > 9 (only if Official judge is No and Judge not in {HBO-Lederman, USA Today, Associated Press})
    nodes[4] = X["Round"] > 9

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1
        elif nodes[3]:
            prediction = 0
        elif nodes[4]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # Default case (should not happen)
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the features as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted class label (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
