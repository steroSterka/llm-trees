<think>

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a decision tree to predict which fighter (Trinidad or De la Hoya) won a round based on given features. The features are the judge's name, whether they're an official judge, and the round number.

First, I need to understand the features. The judge names are categorical with multiple options. The "Official judge" is a binary feature, and the round is numerical from 1 to 12.

The example provided used petal width as the main splitter, so maybe here I should look for the most important feature. Since the user didn't provide data, I have to make logical assumptions.

Starting with the official judge. Maybe official judges have a different scoring pattern? If official judges are more likely to follow specific criteria, perhaps they lean towards one fighter more often. Let's say official judges might favor Trinidad due to some bias or vice versa. That could be the first split.

Next, if not official, the judge's name might matter. Different judges might have preferences. For example, maybe G. Hamada tends to favor De la Hoya, while others don't. But since there are many judges, maybe the most critical ones are those that have a noticeable trend. Alternatively, the round number could be important. In later rounds, one fighter might be tiring or gaining dominance.

Wait, the example decision tree used a numerical feature first. Maybe the round number is a good starting point. For instance, early rounds might be closer, but later rounds could have a clearer winner. Suppose in rounds 1-6, the fight is even, but after round 7, Trinidad starts winning more. Or maybe De la Hoya peaks in certain rounds.

Alternatively, official judges might have a different pattern. Let's consider splitting on Official judge first. Suppose if it's an official judge, then maybe they look at the round. For example, in official judges, if the round is over 8, Trinidad wins; else, De la Hoya. But without data, this is speculative.

Alternatively, the judge's name could be a key factor. Maybe certain judges consistently favor one fighter. For example, if "Sportsticker" always picks Trinidad, that's a strong split. But since there are many judges, maybe group them into those who are official and others. Wait, the official judge is a separate feature. So perhaps first split on official judge, then within each, split on round or judge name.

Alternatively, maybe the round number is the most important. For example, in Round <=6, De la Hoya wins, above that, Trinidad. But that's a simplistic view.

Alternatively, maybe the combination of official judge and round. Like, official judges in later rounds favor Trinidad, while non-officials in early rounds favor De la Hoya.

Hmm. Since the example used a numerical split first, maybe start with Round. Let's assume that the round number determines the winner based on fatigue or strategy. For instance, rounds 1-6 might be De la Hoya's, 7-12 Trinidad's. But maybe there's a threshold, say round 8. So first split on Round <=8. If yes, then check something else. But maybe that's the first split.

Alternatively, considering that official judges might have a different scoring. Let me try structuring the tree:

Start with Official Judge: Yes/No.

If Yes (official), then maybe split on Round. Suppose official judges in rounds 1-6 give De la Hoya, and 7-12 Trinidad. Or maybe the other way around. Alternatively, check if the round is even or odd, but that's arbitrary.

Alternatively, if official, maybe look at the judge's name? But the official judge is a separate category, so maybe the name isn't needed if it's official. Wait, the official judge is a binary feature, so maybe the names are for non-officials? Or perhaps the official judge is part of the list but marked as yes. Hmm, the features include both the judge's name and whether they're official. So a judge can be official or not, and their name is one of the listed.

This is getting a bit confusing without data. Maybe the most important feature is whether the judge is official. Let's assume that official judges have a different pattern. Suppose official judges tend to favor Trinidad in later rounds. So first split on official judge. Then, within official, split on Round > some number. For non-official judges, maybe split on their name. For example, if the judge is G. Hamada, then De la Hoya wins, etc. But that would make the tree too deep.

Alternatively, the most important feature might be the round number. Let's say rounds 1-6 are De la Hoya, 7-12 Trinidad. So first split on Round <=6. If yes, De la Hoya; else, Trinidad. But maybe that's oversimplified.

Alternatively, combining round and official judge. For instance:

First split on Official Judge:

- If Yes: Split on Round. If Round > 8, Trinidad; else, De la Hoya.

- If No: Split on Judge Name. For example, if the judge is "Sportsticker", Trinidad; else, check another feature.

But since there are many judges, perhaps a better approach is to see if certain non-official judges have a pattern. For example, maybe most non-officials in the early rounds favor De la Hoya, but in later rounds, it's mixed.

Alternatively, maybe the decision tree starts with Round:

Round <= 6?

- Yes → De la Hoya

- No → Then check if Official Judge:

   - Yes → Trinidad

   - No → Check Judge Name (like if it's a specific judge, then Trinidad, else De la Hoya)

This is just an assumption. Since I can't see the data, I have to make logical splits based on common boxing patterns. Maybe the later rounds favor the eventual winner, so if the official judges recognize that, while non-officials might differ.

Alternatively, considering that in the example, the first split was on a numerical feature, perhaps Round is first. Let me try that.

First split on Round <=8.

If yes (rounds 1-8), then maybe split on Official Judge.

If round <=8 and official, maybe De la Hoya, else check another feature.

Alternatively, it's a bit tricky. Since I need to make a plausible tree without data, perhaps the best approach is:

Start with the Official Judge feature.

- If Official: Then split on Round. For example, if Round > 8 → Trinidad, else De la Hoya.

- If Not Official: Then split on Judge Name. For instance, if the judge is "Sportsticker" → Trinidad, else if "G. Hamada" → De la Hoya, etc. But with many judges, maybe the most impactful is a subset.

Alternatively, for non-official judges, the winner might depend on the round again but in a different way.

Alternatively, maybe the key is that official judges have a different cutoff. Let me structure it as:

Decision Tree:

|--- Official Judge = Yes

||--- Round <= 8

||||--- class: De la Hoya

||--- Round > 8

||||--- class: Trinidad

|--- Official Judge = No

||--- Round <= 6

||||--- class: De la Hoya

||--- Round > 6

||||--- class: Trinidad

This assumes that official judges favor De la Hoya in early-middle rounds and Trinidad later, while non-officials have a different split at round 6. This is a guess but follows the example's structure of splitting on numerical features after a categorical one.

Alternatively, maybe the non-official judges have a different pattern, like splitting on their name. But with so many judges, it's hard to pick one. Maybe the most common judge among non-officials is key. For example:

|--- Official Judge = Yes

||--- Round <= 8 → De la Hoya, else Trinidad

|--- Official Judge = No

||--- Judge is "Sportsticker" → Trinidad

||--- Else → De la Hoya

But without knowing which judges lean which way, this is arbitrary.

Alternatively, since the example used a single numerical split first, maybe start with the round, then official judge, etc.

Alternatively, start with Round as the first split. Let's say:

|--- Round <=6

||--- Official Judge = Yes → De la Hoya

||--- Else → De la Hoya

Wait, but that may not make sense. Maybe:

First split on Round:

|--- Round <= 8

||--- Official Judge = Yes → De la Hoya

||--- Else → Trinidad

|--- Round >8

||--- Official Judge = Yes → Trinidad

||--- Else → De la Hoya

This is conflicting. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the official judges are more consistent in later rounds. Let me try a different approach. Since the user's example splits on a numerical feature first (petal width), perhaps the most important feature here is Round, so start there.

Suppose the fight was closer in the beginning, and Trinidad took control in later rounds. So rounds 1-6: De la Hoya, 7-12: Trinidad. So:

|--- Round <=6 → De la Hoya

|--- Round >6 → Trinidad

But maybe official judges have a different view. So first split on Round, then within each, split on Official Judge.

Wait, maybe:

|--- Round <=8

||--- Official Judge = Yes → De la Hoya

||--- Else → Trinidad

|--- Round >8

||--- Official Judge = Yes → Trinidad

||--- Else → De la Hoya

But this is just a guess. Alternatively, the key is that official judges have a different cutoff. For example, official judges might consider rounds 1-10 as De la Hoya, then Trinidad in 11-12, while others have a different split.

Alternatively, perhaps the most important feature is the judge's name. For example, if it's G. Hamada, he always picks De la Hoya. But since there are many judges, maybe group them into those who are official and not. So first split on official, then round.

Alternatively, since the features are judge name, official, and round, maybe the decision tree is structured as:

First split on Official Judge.

If official, then split on Round (e.g., >8 → Trinidad)

If not official, split on the judge's name (e.g., if it's a specific judge, then Trinidad, else De la Hoya)

But without data, it's hard. Alternatively, the key is that official judges are more accurate, so their decisions are based on round progression, while non-officials might have biases.

Alternatively, the tree could be:

Start with Official Judge.

- Yes → Split on Round: if Round >8 → Trinidad, else De la Hoya

- No → Split on Judge Name: For example, if Judge is "Sportsticker" → Trinidad, else De la Hoya

This way, the tree uses the most important features first. Official status first, then round for officials, and judge name for non-officials.

But since the user might expect a structure similar to the example which used numerical splits first, maybe Round is first.

Alternatively, maybe the most important is the round, then official.

Alternatively, since in the example, the first split was on a numerical value, perhaps the first split here is on Round, then official judge, etc.

I think the best approach given the lack of data is to start with the round as the first split, then official judge, and then maybe judge name for non-officials.

Alternatively, perhaps the official judges have a different pattern based on the round, so the tree would be:

First split on Round <= some number.

Then, within each, split on official judge.

Alternatively, here's a possible structure:

|--- Round <= 8

||--- Official Judge = Yes → De la Hoya

||--- Official Judge = No → De la Hoya (or maybe split further)

But this might not use all features. Alternatively:

|--- Official Judge = Yes

||--- Round <= 8 → De la Hoya

||--- Round >8 → Trinidad

|--- Official Judge = No

||--- Judge is "Sportsticker" → Trinidad

||--- Else → De la Hoya

This uses official first, then judge name for non-officials, but that might not use round for non-officials. Alternatively, for non-officials, split on round again.

Hmm. Maybe the most robust structure, assuming that official judges are the key, and their decisions depend on the round, while non-officials have a different pattern. Let me try:

Decision Tree:

|--- Official Judge = Yes

||--- Round <= 8 → De la Hoya

||--- Round >8 → Trinidad

|--- Official Judge = No

||--- Round <= 6 → De la Hoya

||--- Round >6 → Trinidad

This way, official judges have a cutoff at round 8, non-officials at 6. Maybe Trinidad started dominating later rounds more in the eyes of official judges, while non-officials thought he took control earlier.

Alternatively, maybe the non-official judges' cutoff is higher. But without data, this is a best guess.

Alternatively, the decision could be that official judges are more likely to favor Trinidad in rounds 7-12, while non-officials have different splits.

Alternatively, considering that in the example, the splits were numerical, perhaps the first split is on the round, then official.

So:

|--- Round <= 8

||--- Official Judge = Yes → De la Hoya

||--- Else → De la Hoya (or maybe split further)

Wait, this might not make sense. Alternatively:

|--- Round <= 6

||--- class: De la Hoya

|--- Round >6

||--- Official Judge = Yes → Trinidad

||--- Else → De la Hoya

This suggests that after round 6, official judges give Trinidad, others still De la Hoya until later.

Alternatively, maybe after round 8, even non-officials switch. But again, without data, it's hard.

Alternatively, the most straightforward approach is to have the decision based on Round and Official Judge. Let's go with the first idea where official judges split at 8, non-officials at 6.

So finalizing the tree structure as:

|--- Official Judge = Yes

||--- Round <= 8 → De la Hoya

||--- Round > 8 → Trinidad

|--- Official Judge = No

||--- Round <= 6 → De la Hoya

||--- Round > 6 → Trinidad

That seems logical. It uses both features in a way that makes sense: official judges have a later cutoff, non-officials an earlier one. The round is the key numerical feature after the official status.

Alternatively, maybe the non-officials have a different cutoff, but this structure uses the features in a decision tree hierarchy. It's similar to the example, starting with a categorical split (official yes/no), then numerical splits for each branch. That should meet the user's request.

Decision Tree:

||--- **Round > 8**

### Explanation:
1. **First Split (Categorical):**  
   Start with `Official Judge` because official judges likely follow stricter scoring criteria (e.g., favoring later rounds for Trinidad as the fight progresses).  
   
2. **Second Split (Numerical):**  
   - **For Official Judges:**  
     Split on `Round <= 8`. Early rounds (1–8) favor De la Hoya, while rounds 9–12 favor Trinidad (assuming Trinidad dominated later rounds in the fight).  
   - **For Non-Official Judges:**  
     Split on `Round <= 6`. Early rounds (1–6) favor De la Hoya, but after round 6, Trinidad’s performance gains traction in non-official scoring.  

This structure prioritizes the most impactful features (judge status and round progression) while simplifying splits to mirror the example’s style.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to create a Python function based on a decision tree they provided, but they didn't actually give the structure of the decision tree. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe they mentioned the features and target variable, so maybe I need to come up with a plausible decision tree based on the features they listed?

The features are Judge, Official, Round, and the target is who won the round (0 or 1). The example function they provided uses conditions on different features. So, I need to make a decision tree that uses those features to predict the target. Let me think about how these features might be used.

First, the Judge is a categorical variable with multiple options. Since it's encoded as 0 to 10, maybe the first split could be on the judge. For example, if the judge is one of the first few, maybe the prediction is different. But how to choose thresholds?

Then, Official is binary (1 or 0). Maybe if it's an official judge, that affects the outcome. Round is from 1 to 12, so maybe rounds later in the fight have different outcomes.

Let me try to structure a simple decision tree. Let's start with the first node. Maybe check if the round is greater than a certain number, say 8. If so, maybe the prediction is 1 (de la Hoya). But that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe check the judge first. Suppose the first split is on the judge's identity. Let's say if the judge is 0 (G. Hamada), then check another condition. Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the Official status.

Alternatively, let's think of a possible decision path. For example:

- If the round is greater than 6 (later rounds), then look at the official judge. If official is 1, then maybe predict 1. Otherwise, maybe check the judge's number. Or something like that.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the Official. If it's an official judge (1), then maybe the decision is based on the judge's identity. Otherwise, based on the round.

Wait, but the example function they gave has nodes as conditions. The nodes array tracks which conditions are met. So each node is a condition, and the path through the tree follows the true/false branches, with the nodes array marking which conditions were true.

The function returns the prediction and the list of node truth values. The nodes list should have 1s where the condition was true, 0 otherwise.

Since the user didn't provide the actual tree structure, I have to make one up. Let me try to come up with a plausible tree structure using the given features.

Let's say the decision tree is as follows:

Root node: Judge is HBO-Lederman (which is 3). So first check if X['Judge'] == 3? But how to represent that as a condition? Since it's a categorical variable, we can do X['Judge'] == 3.

Wait, but the example uses inequalities. So maybe the first node is (Judge == 3). Then, if yes, check another condition, like Round > 6. Then, if Round > 6, predict 1, else 0. Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Round. Let's try:

First node: Round > 6 (later rounds). If yes, then check Official. If official is 1 (yes), then predict 1. Else, predict 0. If Round <=6, then check Judge's value. Maybe if Judge is 4 (Sportsticker), then predict 0, else predict 1. This is just a made-up structure.

Alternatively, let's think of a simple tree with three nodes. Let's structure it like this:

nodes[0]: X['Official'] == 1 (is official judge?)

If yes (node0 is True, so 1 in the list), then check nodes[1] which might be Round > 8.

If nodes[1] is true (Round >8), then predict 1.

Else (Round <=8), maybe check Judge's value. For example, if Judge is HBO-Lederman (3), predict 0 else 1.

Wait, but the example function has multiple nodes and nested ifs. So need to structure it with multiple conditions.

Alternatively, here's a possible structure (nodes numbered 0 to 4):

nodes[0] = X['Round'] > 6

If nodes[0] is true (Round >6):

   nodes[1] = X['Official'] == 1

   if nodes[1] is true (Official yes):

       nodes[2] = X['Judge'] == 3  # HBO-Lederman

       if nodes[2] is true:

           predict 0

       else:

           predict 1

   else (Official no):

       nodes[3] = X['Judge'] > 5   # e.g., judges after 5?

       if nodes[3] is true:

           predict 1

       else:

           predict 0

Else (Round <=6):

   nodes[4] = X['Judge'] < 2      # G. Hamada (0) or B. Logist (1)

   if nodes[4] is true:

       predict 0

   else:

       predict 1

Hmm, that might work. But I need to translate that into the function with the nodes array and the if-else structure.

Alternatively, maybe a simpler tree. Let me try to write the function step by step.

First, the nodes list. Let's say we have 5 nodes.

nodes[0] could be (X['Round'] > 6)

nodes[1] could be (X['Official'] == 1)

nodes[2] = (X['Judge'] == 3)

nodes[3] = (X['Judge'] > 5)

nodes[4] = (X['Judge'] < 2)

Then the logic would be:

if nodes[0] (Round>6):

   if nodes[1] (Official is yes):

      if nodes[2] (Judge is 3):

          predict 0

      else:

          predict 1

   else (Official no):

      if nodes[3] (Judge>5):

          predict 1

      else:

          predict 0

else (Round <=6):

   if nodes[4] (Judge <2):

       predict 0

   else:

       predict 1

Wait, but the nodes list must be in order of the tree structure, and the if-else nesting must follow the tree's path.

Wait, perhaps the nodes array is just the conditions in order of the nodes in the tree. The example has nodes[0] to nodes[4], each condition corresponds to a node in the tree. The function then evaluates the conditions in order, and the nodes array records whether each condition was true.

But the user's example has nodes[0] to nodes[4], and the if statements are nested based on the tree's structure.

So, the function's structure is built based on the decision tree's path.

But without the actual tree structure provided by the user, I need to make one up, but it has to use the features given. Let's proceed with the previous example.

Wait, but in the features, the target is 0 or 1, so the prediction must be 0 or 1. Let me try to code the function structure as per the hypothetical tree.

Let me try to write the code step by step.

The features are Judge (0-10), Official (0/1), Round (1-12). The target is 0 or 1.

The function signature is:

def predict(X: dict):

    nodes = 5 * [None]

    # set each node's condition here

    nodes[0] = X['Round'] > 6

    nodes[1] = X['Official'] == 1

    nodes[2] = X['Judge'] == 3

    nodes[3] = X['Judge'] > 5

    nodes[4] = X['Judge'] < 2

    # then the if-else structure

    if nodes[0]:

        if nodes[1]:

            if nodes[2]:

                prediction = 0

            else:

                prediction = 1

        else: # Official is 0

            if nodes[3]:

                prediction = 1

            else:

                prediction = 0

    else: # Round <=6

        if nodes[4]:

            prediction = 0

        else:

            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but in the nodes array, each entry is a boolean. The code above sets each node's condition as the boolean result. Then, the if statements use those nodes. So the nodes list correctly tracks which conditions were true.

But I need to make sure that all nodes are part of the decision path. For example, in the above code, for some paths, not all nodes are evaluated. For example, if the first condition (nodes[0]) is false, then nodes[1], 2, 3 are not evaluated, but since nodes is initialized with 5 elements, each node's condition must be assigned, even if not used in the path.

Ah, right. The nodes list must have all the conditions evaluated, even if they are on different branches. So in the code above, even if nodes[0] is false, we still need to set nodes[1], nodes[2], etc. But in the current code, nodes[1] to [4] may not be assigned if the first condition is false. Wait, no. Because in the way I wrote it, nodes[0], nodes[1], etc. are all set before the if statements. So all the conditions are computed regardless of the path. Wait, in my code example above, the nodes are computed first, then the code uses the nodes' boolean values to decide the path, but the nodes list is already filled with all the conditions. Because in Python, the assignment to nodes[0], nodes[1], etc. happens regardless of the if conditions. So that's okay.

Wait, the code above sets all nodes[0] to [4] regardless of path. So even if the first condition is false, nodes[1] is still set. So the nodes list will have all the condition results. That's correct.

But in the example provided by the user, in their example code, the nodes are set in order, but the conditions may be in different parts. Wait, in their example, they set all nodes first, then evaluate the conditions through the if-else structure. Wait, no, in their example, the nodes are set first, with all conditions, and then the if statements use those nodes' values. So the same approach.

Therefore, in my code, the nodes are computed first, then the if-else uses the nodes' values. So that's okay.

Now, I need to make sure the nodes are numbered correctly. The order might not matter as long as all conditions are captured.

Alternatively, perhaps a different structure. Let me think of a different tree.

Suppose the first split is on the Official judge. So:

nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1

If true (Official is 1):

   then check if Judge is HBO-Lederman (3). nodes[1] = X['Judge'] ==3

   if yes, then predict 0

   else, check round: nodes[2] = X['Round'] >8

   if round>8: predict 1 else 0

Else (Official is 0):

   check Judge <5: nodes[3] = X['Judge'] <5

   if yes, predict 0 else predict 1.

Hmm, but this requires more nodes. Let's see.

Alternatively, let's think of a tree with three nodes.

nodes[0]: X['Round'] > 6 → if yes, go to node1, else node2.

nodes[1]: X['Judge'] ==3 (HBO-Lederman) → if yes → predict 0, else predict 1.

nodes[2]: X['Official'] ==1 → if yes → predict 1 else predict 0.

Wait, but how to structure this into code.

Alternatively, here's another approach. Since the user's example uses a binary decision tree with nested ifs, perhaps the following structure:

The first node is Round>6 (node0). If yes, check node1 (Official==1). If that's true, check node2 (Judge==3). Else, etc.

Wait, perhaps the following structure:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['Round'] > 6
    nodes[1] = X['Official'] == 1
    nodes[2] = X['Judge'] == 3
    nodes[3] = X['Judge'] > 5
    nodes[4] = X['Round'] <= 8

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[4]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    return prediction, nodes

Hmm, but this requires checking nodes[4] when Round<=6. The nodes[4] is X['Round'] <=8. So if Round is <=6, then nodes[4] will always be True (since 6<=8). So maybe that's not useful. Perhaps nodes[4] could be something else, like X['Judge'] <2?

Alternatively, maybe the leaves are determined by combining multiple conditions.

Alternatively, let's think of a simple tree with three nodes:

nodes[0]: Round >6 → if yes, check node1 (Official=1). If yes, predict 1. Else predict 0.

If nodes[0] is false (Round <=6), then check node2 (Judge <2 → 0 or1). If yes, predict 0, else predict 1.

So the code would be:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3*[None]
    nodes[0] = X['Round']>6
    nodes[1] = X['Official'] ==1
    nodes[2] = X['Judge'] <2

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =1
        else:
            prediction =0
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction =0
        else:
            prediction =1
    return prediction, nodes

But the user's example has 5 nodes. Maybe I should use 5 nodes. Let me try to make a more complex tree.

Suppose the first split is on Round >6 (node0). Then, for those, split on Official (node1). For Official yes, split on Judge ==3 (node2). For Official no, split on Judge>5 (node3). For Round <=6 (node0), split on Judge <2 (node4).

Then the code:

nodes[0] = X['Round']>6

nodes[1] = X['Official'] ==1

nodes[2] = X['Judge'] ==3

nodes[3] = X['Judge']>5

nodes[4] = X['Judge'] <2

Then:

if nodes[0]:

    if nodes[1]:

        if nodes[2]:

            predict 0

        else:

            predict 1

    else:

        if nodes[3]:

            predict 1

        else:

            predict 0

else:

    if nodes[4]:

        predict 0

    else:

        predict 1

This uses all 5 nodes.

So that would be the code.

Now, let's write this in code:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['Round'] > 6
    nodes[1] = X['Official'] == 1
    nodes[2] = X['Judge'] == 3
    nodes[3] = X['Judge'] > 5
    nodes[4] = X['Judge'] < 2

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[4]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    return prediction, nodes

This seems okay. But I need to ensure that all nodes are being evaluated, which they are, since nodes[0] through [4] are assigned before the if statements.

Now, the nodes list will have each condition's boolean result. For example, nodes[2] is whether Judge is 3, but in the path where nodes[0] is false, we still compute nodes[2], even though it's not used. But that's okay, since the nodes list must contain all the conditions regardless of the path taken.

This should be acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the user's example uses nested conditions, but I think this approach is okay.

Thus, this is a possible function. The actual tree structure depends on the problem's requirements, but since it's unspecified, this is a plausible answer.

Another possible approach: maybe the first split is on Judge, but I think the above approach is okay.

I think this is a valid solution given the problem's constraints.
