To build a decision tree that classifies which of the two boxing fighters (Trinidad or de la Hoya) won each round based on the given features, we'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure all data is correctly formatted and ready for analysis.
2. **Feature Selection**: Since the task doesn't specify how to select the most important features, we will assume that we are looking at the impact of judges' scores on determining the winner of each round. The "Offical judge" feature might not be as influential in a round-by-round basis since all official decisions would typically come from official judges.
3. **Decision Tree Construction**: We'll construct a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 to keep it simple and prevent overfitting.

Given the features:
- Judge (multiple options)
- Offical judge (yes / no)
- Round (1 to 12)

And aiming for a classification of Trinidad or de la Hoya winning each round, without actual data on how these judges voted in specific rounds or their tendencies, we can make an educated guess. However, the features provided do not directly relate to actions within a boxing match that would influence who wins a round (e.g., punches landed, defense, aggression). 

For demonstration purposes, let's assume:
- The "Judge" feature has some predictive power based on the judges' scoring tendencies.
- The "Round" might influence the outcome due to fighter strategies or fatigue.

Given these assumptions and without specific data, we can hypothesize a decision tree structure:

1. **Root Node**: Judge
   - If the judge tends to favor aggressive fighters (e.g., HBO-Lederman, known for rewarding offense), this could lean towards Trinidad if he's perceived as more aggressive.
   - If the judge favors technical skill (e.g., van de Wiele), this might lean towards de la Hoya if seen as more technically sound.

2. **First Layer**:
   - **Judge = Aggressive Favoring**: 
     - Round <= 6: Trinidad (assuming early aggression pays off)
     - Round > 6: de la Hoya (assuming late-round strategy and endurance play a role)
   - **Judge = Technical Favoring**:
     - Round <= 6: de la Hoya (technical skill often shines in early rounds)
     - Round > 6: Trinidad (if aggression remains effective or de la Hoya tires)

3. **Decision Tree Structure**:
```
|--- Judge = Aggressive Favoring
||--- Round <= 6: Trinidad
||--- Round > 6: de la Hoya
|--- Judge = Technical Favoring
||--- Round <= 6: de la Hoya
||--- Round > 6: Trinidad
```

This structure is highly speculative and simplified. Real-world application would require detailed round-by-round scoring data from these judges, information on the fighters' strategies, and possibly more nuanced features like punch statistics or corner advice between rounds. 

Remember, this decision tree is based on assumptions rather than actual data analysis due to the nature of the question. In practice, building such a model would involve collecting extensive data on past fights judged by these individuals, analyzing their scoring patterns, and integrating additional relevant features that directly influence round outcomes in boxing matches.

Here's a Python function representing the decision tree for predicting which of the two boxing fighters won each round:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts which boxer won a round based on judge and round information.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing features.
            - 'Judge': The judge's ID (0-10).
            - 'Official': Whether the judge is official (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
            - 'Round': The round number (1-12).

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction and a list of node truth values.
            - Prediction: 0 if Trinidad won, 1 if de la Hoya won.
            - Node truth values: [judge condition, round condition].
    """

    # Define nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Judge condition: HBO-Lederman (3) and Sportsticker (4) tend to favor aggressive fighters,
    # while van de Wiele (10) tends to favor technical skill.
    nodes[0] = X['Judge'] in [3, 4]  # Aggressive judges
    
    # Round condition: Early rounds favor aggression, late rounds favor endurance and strategy.
    nodes[1] = X['Round'] <= 6  # Early rounds

    # Predict based on nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0 if nodes[1] else 1  # Trinidad wins early rounds, de la Hoya wins late rounds
    else:
        prediction = 1 if nodes[1] else 0  # de la Hoya wins early rounds, Trinidad wins late rounds

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]

# Example usage:
X = {
    'Judge': 3,
    'Official': 1,
    'Round': 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # 0 if Trinidad won, 1 if de la Hoya won
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}")
```

This function uses a simple decision tree with two conditions:

*   Judge condition: If the judge tends to favor aggressive fighters (HBO-Lederman or Sportsticker), this condition is true.
*   Round condition: If the round is early (round 6 or earlier), this condition is true.

The prediction is made based on these conditions. If the judge favors aggression and it's an early round, Trinidad is predicted to win. Otherwise, de la Hoya is predicted to win. The node truth values are returned as a list of integers, where 1 represents True and 0 represents False.
