To build a decision tree with the provided features for classifying which of the two boxing fighters (Trinidad or de la Hoya) won each round, we first need to understand that the features given are not directly related to the outcome of a boxing match. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume these features have some predictive power over the outcome of rounds in a boxing match between Trinidad and de la Hoya.

Given the lack of actual data on how these judges score or their tendencies in relation to Trinidad vs. de la Hoya matches, I will proceed with a hypothetical approach based on general knowledge of decision trees and the assumption that we are looking for a simple model to classify round winners based on judge identity and round number.

### Features:
1. **Judge**: The identity of the judge scoring the round (e.g., G. Hamada, B. Logist, etc.)
2. **Official Judge**: Whether the judge is an official one (yes/no)
3. **Round**: The round being scored (1 to 12)

### Hypothetical Decision Tree with a Maximum Depth of 2:
For simplicity and due to the lack of specific data on scoring tendencies, we'll consider that certain judges might favor Trinidad over de la Hoya or vice versa based on their identities and whether they are official judges.

- **Root Node**: Judge
    - The decision tree starts by checking which judge is scoring. Let's say for this hypothetical example:
        - If the judge is "G. Hamada" or "B. Logist", we proceed to check if they are an official judge because these judges might have a tendency to score differently based on their official status.
        - For other judges, we directly classify the winner based on the round number due to a lack of detailed information.

- **Left Child (G. Hamada or B. Logist)**:
    - **Node**: Official Judge
        - If "yes", proceed with classification under the assumption that as official judges, their scores might lean towards Trinidad in earlier rounds due to his aggressive style.
        - If "no", classify based on a different criterion, possibly favoring de la Hoya in later rounds if these unofficial scores are seen as less biased towards aggression.

- **Right Child (Other Judges)**:
    - **Node**: Round
        - Rounds 1-6: Classify as Trinidad due to his known aggressive start.
        - Rounds 7-12: Classify as de la Hoya, considering he might gain an advantage in later rounds with his technical skill.

### Example Decision Tree:

|--- Judge == G. Hamada or B. Logist
||--- Official Judge == yes
|||--- Round <= 6: Trinidad
|||--- Round > 6: de la Hoya
||--- Official Judge == no
|||--- Round <= 6: de la Hoya
|||--- Round > 6: Trinidad
|--- Judge != G. Hamada or B. Logist
||--- Round <= 6: Trinidad
||--- Round > 6: de la Hoya

This decision tree is highly speculative and for illustrative purposes only, as the actual outcome of boxing rounds depends on numerous factors including fighter performance, strategy, and subjective judge scoring. Real-world application would require detailed data analysis on judge tendencies, fight statistics, and potentially other factors like fighter health and training regimens leading up to the match.

Here's a Python function representing the decision tree for predicting which of the two boxing fighters won each round:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts which boxer wins a round based on the judge and round number.

    Args:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the features.
        - 'Judge': The identity of the judge scoring the round (0 = G. Hamada, 1 = B. Logist, etc.)
        - 'Official': Whether the judge is an official one (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
        - 'Round': The round being scored (1 to 12)

    Returns:
    prediction (int): The predicted winner of the round (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)
    nodes (list): A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Check if the judge is G. Hamada or B. Logist and if they are an official judge
    nodes[0] = X['Judge'] in [0, 1] and X['Official'] == 1
    # Check the round number
    nodes[1] = X['Round'] <= 6

    prediction = None
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins early rounds with official judges G. Hamada or B. Logist
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins later rounds with official judges G. Hamada or B. Logist
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins early rounds with other judges or non-official judges
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins later rounds with other judges or non-official judges

    # Convert boolean values in nodes to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes


# Example usage
X = {
    'Judge': 0,  # G. Hamada
    'Official': 1,  # Official judge
    'Round': 7  # Round 7
}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (de la Hoya wins)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [0, 0]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features as input and returns a tuple with the predicted winner of the round (`prediction`) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes (`nodes`). The decision tree logic is implemented based on the provided features and target variable. Note that the actual performance of this model may vary depending on the quality and characteristics of the training data.
