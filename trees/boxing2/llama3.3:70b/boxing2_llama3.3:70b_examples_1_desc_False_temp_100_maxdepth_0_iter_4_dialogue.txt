To build a decision tree that classifies which of the two boxing fighters (Trinidad or de la Hoya) won each round based on the given features, we first need to understand the significance of these features in predicting the outcome of a round. The features provided are:

1. **Judge**: This could refer to the name of the judge or the source of the judgment (e.g., G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth, etc.). Each judge might have a slightly different scoring system or bias.
2. **Official Judge (yes / no)**: This indicates whether the judge is an official scorer for the fight or not. Official judges' scores are what typically determine the winner of each round.
3. **Round (1 to 12)**: The number of the round being fought.

Given these features, we're tasked with constructing a decision tree that predicts which fighter won a given round. However, without specific data on how judges scored rounds or any direct indicators of performance within those rounds (like punches landed, etc.), we must infer based on the structure and importance of the provided features.

Here's a hypothetical approach to building such a decision tree:

1. **Root Node: Official Judge**
   - The first split could be based on whether the judge is an official scorer or not because their opinions are more directly influential in determining round winners.
     - **Official Judge = Yes**: Proceed to consider scores from these judges as they are decisive.
     - **Official Judge = No**: Consider other factors for non-official judges, as their opinions might be less directly impactful but still indicative of public perception or secondary scoring systems.

2. **For Official Judges (Yes)**
   - Next, we could split based on the **Round** because different rounds might see different strategies or performances from fighters.
     - **Early Rounds (1-4)**: In early rounds, both fighters are typically fresh and looking to establish their rhythm. A judge might favor a fighter who comes out aggressively.
     - **Middle Rounds (5-8)**: As the fight wears on, endurance becomes more of an issue. Judges might start to favor fighters who can maintain a high pace or effectively counterattack.
     - **Late Rounds (9-12)**: In late rounds, judges often look for fighters who can push through fatigue and still manage to land significant shots.

3. **For Non-Official Judges (No)**
   - The decision here might be less about the technical aspects of fighting and more about perceived performance or popular opinion.
     - **Judge**: Different non-official judges (or sources) might have biases towards certain fighters based on their style, reputation, or previous performances.

Given these considerations, a simplified decision tree could look something like this:

|--- Official Judge = Yes
||--- Round <= 4
|||--- Trinidad: If in early rounds, Trinidad is known for strong starts.
||--- Round > 4 and Round <= 8
|||--- de la Hoya: Middle rounds might favor de la Hoya's strategic approach.
||--- Round > 8
|||--- Trinidad: Late rounds could see Trinidad's power taking over if he hasn't been worn down.
|--- Official Judge = No
||--- Judge = [Specific Non-Official Sources]
|||--- de la Hoya: Some non-official judges might favor de la Hoya due to his technical skill and reputation.

Please note, this is a highly speculative decision tree. Real-world application would require actual data on how rounds were scored by each judge, the specific strategies employed by each fighter in different rounds, and possibly other performance metrics like punches thrown, landed, and defensive statistics. Without such detailed information, any decision tree constructed would be based on broad assumptions rather than empirical evidence.

Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree function in Python. The decision tree will classify which of the two boxing fighters (Trinidad or de la Hoya) won each round.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the winner of a round based on the given features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing the features 'Judge', 'Official', 'Round', and target variable 'target'.
    
    Returns:
    prediction (int): The predicted winner of the round (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya).
    nodes (list): A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """
    
    # Initialize nodes with None
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if Official judge is Yes
    nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1
    
    # Node 1: Check if Round is in early rounds (1-4)
    nodes[1] = X['Round'] <= 4
    
    # Node 2: Check if Judge is HBO-Lederman or Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
    nodes[2] = X['Judge'] == 3 or X['Judge'] == 5
    
    # Predict the winner based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad is likely to win in early rounds as an official judge
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya might be favored by specific judges in later rounds
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Otherwise, Trinidad is more likely to win
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Non-official judges might still favor Trinidad in early rounds
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya could be favored by non-official judges in later rounds
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]

# Example usage
X = {
    'Judge': 3,
    'Official': 1,
    'Round': 5,
    'target': None  # Not used in this example
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Predicted winner: {['Trinidad', 'de la Hoya'][prediction]}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This decision tree uses the following logic:

1. If the judge is an official judge (`Official` == 1), then:
   - In early rounds (1-4), Trinidad is likely to win.
   - In later rounds, if the judge is HBO-Lederman or Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, de la Hoya might be favored; otherwise, Trinidad is more likely to win.

2. If the judge is not an official judge (`Official` == 0), then:
   - In early rounds, non-official judges might still favor Trinidad.
   - In later rounds, de la Hoya could be favored by non-official judges.

Note that this decision tree is a simplified example and may not accurately predict the winner of each round based on real-world data. The actual performance of the fighters, their strategies, and other factors would influence the outcome of each round.
