Based on the features you provided, I will induce a decision tree classifier to predict which boxer won each round. Here is the decision tree:

|--- Judge: HBO-Lederman
||--- class: Trinidad
|--- Judge: Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
||--- Round <= 6
|||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Round > 6
|||--- class: de la Hoya
|--- Judge: USA Today
||--- Offical judge: yes
|||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Offical judge: no
|||--- class: de la Hoya
|--- Judge: Associated Press
||--- Round <= 9
|||--- class: de la Hoya
||--- Round > 9
|||--- class: Trinidad
|--- Other Judges
||--- Round <= 3
|||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Round > 3
|||--- class: de la Hoya

Note that this decision tree is not exhaustive, and there may be other possible trees that can be induced from the features. Also, the accuracy of the tree depends on the quality of the data and the specific characteristics of the boxing match.

The most important features used in this decision tree are:

1. Judge: The judge's opinion seems to have a significant impact on the outcome of each round.
2. Round: The round number also plays a crucial role in determining the winner, with Trinidad tend to win earlier rounds and de la Hoya winning later rounds.

The other features, such as Offical judge, seem to have less importance in this decision tree. However, they may still be useful in certain situations or when combined with other features.

Here's a Python function that represents the decision tree for predicting which boxer won each round:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts which boxer won each round based on the given features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the features.
            - 'Judge': The judge's ID (0 = G. Hamada, 1 = B. Logist, 2 = J. Roth, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 4 = Sportsticker,
                       5 = Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, 6 = USA Today, 7 = Associated Press, 8 = Las Vegas Review-Journal,
                       9 = Los Angeles Times-Springer, 10 = van de Wiele)
            - 'Official': Whether the judge is official (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
            - 'Round': The round number (1 to 12)

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """

    # Initialize the nodes with None
    nodes = 5 * [None]

    # Node 0: Check if the judge is HBO-Lederman
    nodes[0] = X['Judge'] == 3

    # Node 1: Check if the judge is Los Angeles Times-Kawakami and round <= 6
    nodes[1] = (X['Judge'] == 5) and (X['Round'] <= 6)

    # Node 2: Check if the judge is USA Today and official judge
    nodes[2] = (X['Judge'] == 6) and (X['Official'] == 1)

    # Node 3: Check if the round > 9 for Associated Press
    nodes[3] = (X['Judge'] == 7) and (X['Round'] > 9)

    # Node 4: Check if the round <= 3 for other judges
    nodes[4] = (X['Judge'] not in [3, 5, 6, 7]) and (X['Round'] <= 3)

    # Make predictions based on the nodes
    prediction = None

    if nodes[0]:  # HBO-Lederman always predicts Trinidad
        prediction = 0
    elif nodes[1]:  # Los Angeles Times-Kawakami predicts Trinidad for rounds <= 6
        prediction = 0
    elif nodes[2]:  # USA Today official judge predicts Trinidad
        prediction = 0
    elif nodes[3]:  # Associated Press predicts Trinidad for rounds > 9
        prediction = 0
    elif nodes[4]:  # Other judges predict Trinidad for rounds <= 3
        prediction = 0
    else:  # Default to de la Hoya
        prediction = 1

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]

# Example usage:
X = {
    'Judge': 5,
    'Official': 1,
    'Round': 6
}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Should print 0 (Trinidad)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input and returns the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes. The prediction is made based on the conditions specified in the decision tree, and the nodes are represented as a list of boolean values.
