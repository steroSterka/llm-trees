Based on the features you provided, I will attempt to build a decision tree classifier to predict which boxer won each round. Since there are only two possible outcomes (Trinidad or de la Hoya), I will use a binary classification approach.

Here's the induced decision tree:

|--- Judge = HBO-Lederman
||--- class: Trinidad
|--- Judge != HBO-Lederman
||--- Round <= 6
|||--- Official judge = yes
||||--- class: de la Hoya
|||--- Official judge = no
||||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Round > 6
|||--- Judge = Las Vegas Review-Journal or Los Angeles Times-Springer
||||--- class: Trinidad
|||--- Judge != Las Vegas Review-Journal and Judge != Los Angeles Times-Springer
||||--- class: de la Hoya

Please note that this decision tree is based on the features you provided, but it might not be the optimal solution. The performance of the tree may vary depending on the actual data distribution.

Here's a brief explanation of the tree:

* If the judge is HBO-Lederman, Trinidad is likely to win.
* For other judges, if it's an official judge and round 6 or earlier, de la Hoya might have an advantage.
* In later rounds (7-12), if the judge is from Las Vegas Review-Journal or Los Angeles Times-Springer, Trinidad is more likely to win. Otherwise, de la Hoya has a higher chance of winning.

Keep in mind that this decision tree is based on a limited set of features and might not capture all the complexities of a real-world boxing match. Additional features, such as fighter statistics, round-by-round scoring, or expert opinions, could potentially improve the accuracy of the classification model.

Here's the decision tree formatted as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Decision Tree Classifier for predicting which boxer won each round.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing features 'Judge', 'Official', 'Round', and target variable 'target'.

    Returns:
    prediction (int): Predicted winner of the round (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya).
    nodes (list): List representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6 and X["Official"] == 1  # Early rounds with official judge
    nodes[2] = (X["Judge"] == 8 or X["Judge"] == 9) and X["Round"] > 6  # Late rounds with specific judges
    nodes[3] = X["Official"] == 0 and X["Round"] <= 6  # Early rounds without official judge

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins if HBO-Lederman is the judge
    elif nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins in early rounds with official judge
    elif nodes[2]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins in late rounds with specific judges
    else:
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins otherwise

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]

# Example usage
features = {
    "Judge": 3,
    "Official": 1,
    "Round": 7,
}
prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Predicted winner of the round
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Truth values of inner nodes
```

Note that I've encoded the `Judge` feature using its corresponding integer value (e.g., HBO-Lederman is represented by `3`). The decision tree logic follows the rules specified earlier, with adjustments made to accommodate the specific features and target variable encoding.
