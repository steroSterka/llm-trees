To build a decision tree for classifying which of the two boxing fighters (Trinidad or de la Hoya) won each round based on the given features, we first need to understand that the provided features are not directly related to the performance or actions within a boxing match. Instead, they seem to relate to the scoring or judgment aspects of the fight.

Given Features:
- Judge: The source of the judge (e.g., G. Hamada, B. Logist, etc.)
- Official Judge: Whether the judge is official or not (yes/no)
- Round: The round number (1 to 12)

Without specific data on how each judge scored each round or more detailed information about the fighters' performance in each round, building an accurate decision tree that predicts which fighter won a round based solely on these features would be speculative. However, we can attempt to create a simplistic model based on assumptions and the structure you've provided.

Let's assume:
- Different judges might have different tendencies or biases towards scoring.
- Official judges are more reliable in their scoring compared to unofficial ones.
- The outcome of rounds could potentially vary based on when they occur (early, middle, late in the fight).

Decision Tree Example:

|--- Round <= 6
||--- Judge = G. Hamada / B. Logist / HBO-Lederman
|||--- Official Judge = yes
||||--- class: Trinidad
|||--- Official Judge = no
||||--- class: de la Hoya
||--- Judge != G. Hamada / B. Logist / HBO-Lederman
|||--- Round <= 3
||||--- class: Trinidad
|||--- Round > 3
||||--- class: de la Hoya
|--- Round > 6
||--- Official Judge = yes
|||--- Judge = Los Angeles Times-Kawakami / USA Today
||||--- class: de la Hoya
|||--- Judge != Los Angeles Times-Kawakami / USA Today
||||--- class: Trinidad
||--- Official Judge = no
|||--- Round <= 9
||||--- class: Trinidad
|||--- Round > 9
||||--- class: de la Hoya

This decision tree is highly speculative and for illustrative purposes only. In reality, predicting the winner of a round in a boxing match involves considering many factors not included here, such as:
- Fighter performance metrics (e.g., punches landed, defense).
- Fight strategy changes over rounds.
- Physical condition of fighters as the fight progresses.

To build an accurate decision tree or any predictive model for this task, you would need detailed data on these aspects and potentially others. The example provided above uses the given features in a simplistic manner to create a structure but lacks the substance needed for real-world prediction accuracy.

Based on the provided decision tree structure and feature descriptions, here's a Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting which boxer won each round:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts which boxer won the round based on the given features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the features 'Judge', 'Official', and 'Round'.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the predicted winner (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """

    # Initialize the list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 5 * [None]

    # Node 0: Check if Round is less than or equal to 6
    nodes[0] = X['Round'] <= 6

    # Node 1: Check if Judge is G. Hamada, B. Logist, or HBO-Lederman (codes 0, 1, or 3)
    nodes[1] = X['Judge'] in [0, 1, 3]

    # Node 2: Check if Official judge is yes (code 1)
    nodes[2] = X['Official'] == 1

    # Node 3: Check if Round is less than or equal to 3
    nodes[3] = X['Round'] <= 3

    # Node 4: Check if Judge is Los Angeles Times-Kawakami or USA Today (codes 5 or 6)
    nodes[4] = X['Judge'] in [5, 6]

    # Make the prediction based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]

# Example usage
features = {
    'Judge': 0,
    'Official': 1,
    'Round': 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Predicted winner: {['Trinidad', 'de la Hoya'][prediction]}")
print(f"Inner node truth values: {nodes}")
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features 'Judge', 'Official', and 'Round' as input and returns a tuple with the predicted winner (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes. The decision tree is implemented based on the provided structure, using the given feature encodings and ranges.

Note that this implementation assumes the target variable encoding is as described: 0 = Trinidad and 1 = de la Hoya. Also, the function uses integer values to represent the truth values of the inner nodes (1 for True and 0 for False).
