To build a decision tree classifier for determining which boxer won each round based on the provided features, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understanding the Features**:
   - **Judge**: The name of the judge scoring the fight.
   - **Official Judge**: Whether the judge is an official judge or not (yes/no).
   - **Round**: The round number in the fight (1 to 12).

2. **Building the Decision Tree**:
   Given that we want a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 and considering the most important features for classifying which boxer won, let's proceed under the assumption that historical data on judges' scoring tendencies and rounds could influence outcomes.

3. **Decision Tree Construction Logic**:
   - At the first level (depth=1), we'll consider the feature that has the highest impact on the outcome. Given the options, "Judge" might have a significant influence because different judges may have biases towards certain fighters based on their style or past performances.
   - At the second level (depth=2), for each branch from the first level, we could further divide based on another feature that influences the outcome within those specific conditions. Here, "Round" might be crucial as it reflects the progression of the fight and potential fatigue or strategy shifts.

4. **Sample Decision Tree**:
   Given the constraints and aiming to classify which boxer won (Trinidad / de la Hoya) each round based on the provided features:

   - First Level: Judge
     |--- Judge == G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth
       ||--- Round <= 6
         |||--- Class: Trinidad
       ||--- Round > 6
         |||--- Class: de la Hoya
     |--- Judge == HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, USA Today, Associated Press, Las Vegas Review-Journal, Los Angeles Times-Springer, van de Wiele
       ||--- Round <= 6
         |||--- Class: Trinidad
       ||--- Round > 6
         |||--- Class: de la Hoya

   **Note**: This decision tree is a simplified example based on the provided instructions and might not accurately reflect real-world outcomes without actual data. The logic behind choosing "Judge" as the primary feature at depth=1 and "Round" at depth=2 assumes that judges have biases and fighters' strategies change over rounds, which could influence scoring.

5. **Limitations**:
   - Without actual historical fight data or more detailed features (like fighter stats, pre-fight odds, etc.), this model is speculative.
   - The model doesn't account for the "Official Judge" feature due to its simplicity and assuming all listed judges are official or their influence is significant regardless of designation.

This example illustrates how one might construct a decision tree based on given features. Real-world applications would require training data to determine feature importance accurately and to tune the tree's structure for optimal classification performance.

Here's a Python function implementing the decision tree based on the provided features and target variable. The function takes in a dictionary `X` with the feature values and returns a tuple containing the predicted outcome (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each inner node.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts which boxer won the round based on the decision tree.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing feature values. Keys are 'Judge', 'Official', 'Round'.
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the predicted outcome (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each inner node.
    """
    
    # Initialize nodes with None
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First level condition: Judge is either G. Hamada, B. Logist, or J. Roth (0, 1, 2)
    nodes[0] = X['Judge'] in [0, 1, 2]
    
    # Second level condition: Round number is less than or equal to 6
    nodes[1] = X['Round'] <= 6
    
    # Predict based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins in early rounds with specific judges
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins in late rounds with specific judges
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins in early rounds with other judges
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins in late rounds with other judges
    
    # Convert boolean values to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
features = {
    'Judge': 0,  # G. Hamada
    'Official': 1,  # Official judge
    'Round': 5  # Round number
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Trinidad wins)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [1, 1] indicating both conditions are met
```

This implementation assumes the decision tree structure as previously discussed, with adjustments to fit the provided feature names and encodings. The `predict` function evaluates the conditions at each inner node based on the input features and returns a prediction along with the truth values of these conditions.
