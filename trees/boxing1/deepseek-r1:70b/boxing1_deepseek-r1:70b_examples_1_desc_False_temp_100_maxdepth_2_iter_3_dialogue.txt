Alright, so the user wants me to build a decision tree classifier with specific features to determine which boxer won each round. They provided an example using Iris dataset features and another one about boxing judges. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I need to understand the problem. The goal is to classify rounds as either won by Lewis or Holyfield based on certain features related to the judges. The features given are:

1. Judge: a list of different judges like E. Williams, L. O'Connell, etc.
2. Official judge: yes or no
3. Round number: from 1 to 12

The user wants a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. That means the tree can have at most two levels of splits, which isn't too complex.

Starting with the root node, I should choose the most important feature first. The example they gave used petal width and then another feature, so I'll follow that structure here.

Looking at the features, 'Judge' seems crucial because different judges might have biases towards a boxer. However, it's categorical with many categories, which could complicate things. Maybe grouping them or selecting the most influential ones would help.

Alternatively, 'Official judge' is a binary feature, which is simpler and might be more straightforward to split on. If I use that as the first split, it divides the data into two groups: official judges and non-official (like media) judges. That seems logical because official judges' scores are more authoritative.

So, the root would split based on 'Official judge'. Then, for each branch, I need another feature to make a second split since depth is 2.

For the 'yes' branch of official judges, maybe look at 'Round' as the next feature. Early rounds could favor one boxer, and later rounds another. For example, if Round <=6, it might lean towards Holyfield's style, which might be more aggressive early on. Conversely, Rounds >6 could go to Lewis, who might have conserved energy or had a stronger late game.

For the 'no' branch (non-official judges), perhaps use 'Judge' as the next feature. Since there are many judges, I'll pick two that might represent different tendencies. Let's say Holyfield is favored by HBO-Lederman and Boxing Times, while Lewis is favored by others like ESPN or Associated Press.

Wait, but the user didn't specify judge preferences, so I'm making an assumption here based on common judging biases. It's a bit of a stretch, but without data, it's necessary.

So putting it all together:

1. First split: Official Judge (yes/no)
2. If yes:
   - Split on Round <=6 (Holyfield) or >6 (Lewis)
3. If no:
   - Split on specific Judges, assuming certain judges favor each boxer

I need to make sure the tree doesn't exceed depth 2. Each path should have at most two splits.

Potential issues: Without actual data, the splits are hypothetical. Also, using 'Judge' as a secondary feature after non-official might not capture all nuances, but given the constraints, it's manageable.

Final check: The tree classifies each round correctly based on these features and assumptions.

Based on the provided features (`Judge`, `Offical judge`, and `Round`), I will construct a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 to classify which boxer (Lewis or Holyfield) won each round. Here's the decision tree:

```
|--- Official judge: yes
||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: Holyfield
||--- Round > 6
||||--- class: Lewis
|--- Official judge: no
||--- Judge in [HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, Boxing Times]
||||--- class: Holyfield
||--- Judge in [E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu, Sportsline, Associated Press, ESPN, Boxing Monthly-Leach]
||||--- class: Lewis
```

### Explanation:
1. **Root Node (First Split):**
   - The first split is based on whether the judge is an "Official judge" (`yes` or `no`). Official judges are typically more experienced and their decisions may carry more weight.

2. **Second Level Splits:**
   - If the judge is an official judge (`yes`), the second split is based on the round number:
     - Rounds 1-6: Holyfield (assuming Holyfield might have been more dominant in earlier rounds).
     - Rounds 7-12: Lewis (assuming Lewis might have gained momentum in later rounds).

   - If the judge is not an official judge (`no`), the second split is based on the specific judge:
     - Judges like HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, and Boxing Times are assumed to favor Holyfield.
     - Judges like E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu, Sportsline, Associated Press, ESPN, and Boxing Monthly-Leach are assumed to favor Lewis.

This decision tree uses the most important features (`Official judge` and `Round`) to classify the winner of each round.

Okay, so I need to create a Python function that predicts which boxer won each round based on the given features. The decision tree has to be formatted in such a way that it returns not only the prediction but also a list of truth values representing whether the conditions at each inner node were met.

First, I'll look at the features provided: 'Judge', 'Official', and 'Round'. Each has specific encodings or ranges. For example, 'Judge' is encoded numerically from 0 to 9, with each number corresponding to a different judge. 'Official' is a binary feature where 1 means "Yes" and 0 means "No". 'Round' is straightforward, ranging from 1 to 12.

The target variable is which boxer won the round: 1 for Lewis and 0 for Holyfield.

I remember that in the previous example, the function used conditionals based on feature values to make a prediction. The nodes list kept track of whether each condition was true (1) or false (0). So I need to structure my decision tree similarly.

First, I'll think about the structure of the decision tree. At the top level, it seems logical to check if the judge is an official one. So the first node will be based on 'Official' == 1. If it's true, we go down that path; otherwise, we take a different route.

Next, for the second condition, I'll consider the 'Round'. From the earlier example, it seems like the threshold was set at 7. So if the round is greater than or equal to 8, perhaps Lewis has an advantage, and Holyfield might be favored in earlier rounds. This gives us a clear binary split based on the round number.

I also need to ensure that the function handles all possible cases. If 'Official' is 1 and 'Round' >= 8, we predict Lewis (1). If 'Official' is 1 but 'Round' < 8, maybe it's Holyfield (0). Similarly, if 'Official' is 0, regardless of the round, perhaps Lewis is still favored. I need to decide on these thresholds and ensure they make sense based on any patterns or data available.

I'll structure the function step by step: first extract the necessary features from the input dictionary X, set up the nodes list to track condition outcomes, then use if-else statements to determine the prediction based on those conditions. Finally, return both the predicted outcome and the nodes list filled with 1s and 0s representing whether each condition was met.

I also need to make sure that the function is efficient and easy to understand, with clear variable names and comments if necessary. Testing it with sample inputs would help verify that it's working as intended.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list to track condition outcomes (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [None] * 2
    
    # Extract relevant features from the input dictionary X
    official_status = X["Official"]
    round_number = X["Round"]
    
    # First condition: Check if the judge is an official one
    nodes[0] = (official_status == 1)
    
    # Second condition: Check if the round number meets the threshold
    nodes[1] = (round_number >= 8)  # Assuming threshold of 8 as per previous example
    
    # Determine prediction based on conditions
    if nodes[0]:
        # If official, check round number
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Default to Lewis winning if not official
    
    return prediction, [int(nodes[0]), int(nodes[1])]
```

### Explanation:

- **Feature Extraction**: The function starts by extracting the values of 'Official' and 'Round' from the input dictionary `X`.
  
- **Condition Checks**: It then evaluates two conditions:
  1. Whether the judge is an official one (`nodes[0]`).
  2. Whether the round number is greater than or equal to 8 (`nodes[1]`).

- **Prediction Logic**:
  - If the judge is official and the round number is >=8, Lewis is predicted to win.
  - If the judge is official but the round number is <8, Holyfield is predicted to win.
  - If the judge is not official, regardless of the round number, Lewis is defaulted to win.

- **Return Values**: The function returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and a list where each element is 1 if the corresponding condition was met, and 0 otherwise.
