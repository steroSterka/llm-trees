Alright, let me try to figure out how to build a decision tree classifier for determining which boxer won each round based on the given features. The user provided an example using Iris dataset features and another example with different features. Now, they want me to use these specific features: Judge (with several options), Official judge (yes/no), and Round (1-12). The maximum depth of the tree is 2.

First, I need to understand what each feature represents and how it can influence the outcome. 

1. **Judge**: This is a categorical feature with multiple possible values like E. Williams, L. O'Connell, etc. Each judge might have their own bias or tendency in scoring, so knowing who the judge is could help predict the winner.

2. **Official Judge (yes/no)**: This indicates whether the judge is an official one. I assume that official judges might be more consistent or have a different criteria compared to non-official ones, which could affect their decisions.

3. **Round**: This ranges from 1 to 12. The round number might influence the outcome as fighters' performances can vary over time. Early rounds might see different strategies than later rounds.

Now, since the maximum depth is 2, I can only have two levels of decision nodes after the root. That means my tree will have a root node, one level of children (decision nodes), and then another level leading to leaf nodes (class labels: Lewis or Holyfield).

I need to select which features are most important. In classification tasks, feature importance is often determined by how much each feature reduces impurity (like Gini impurity) in the data. However, without actual data, I have to make educated guesses.

- **Judge**: Since each judge's scoring tendencies could vary significantly, this might be a strong predictor.
  
- **Official Judge**: This binary feature adds another layer of distinction but perhaps isn't as influential as knowing which specific judge it is.

- **Round**: The round number could indicate the stage of the fight and might correlate with a fighter's performance over time. For example, Holyfield might start stronger, while Lewis might pace himself better in later rounds.

Given that, I think "Judge" would be the most important feature because each judge's tendencies can directly influence the outcome. So, the root node should split based on the Judge.

Next, at depth 1, we need to further split. Since maximum depth is 2, this will lead to leaf nodes. The next important feature after Judge could be whether they are an Official Judge or not. Alternatively, it might be Round. But considering that without data, it's hard to say which would perform better.

However, the example provided by the user in the Iris dataset used a two-level tree based on petal width first, then another split. So, perhaps using "Judge" as the root and then splitting further based on whether they're an Official Judge makes sense.

Alternatively, considering that Round might have a natural ordering (1-12), it could also be a good second feature to split on. For instance, maybe in earlier rounds one fighter dominates, while in later rounds the other does.

But since I don't have actual data, I need to make an assumption. Perhaps Official Judge is more indicative because being official might mean their judgment is more consistent or reliable, thus impacting the decision more than Round.

So, the structure would be:

- Root: Judge
  - If it's a specific judge (say E. Williams), then check if they're an Official Judge.
    - Yes: Classify as Lewis
    - No: Classify as Holyfield
  - Else, for other judges:
    - Maybe default to another split, but since depth is limited, perhaps directly classify based on whether the judge is official or not.

Wait, actually, with a maximum depth of 2, I can have two splits. So, the first split is on "Judge", then within each branch, split further on either "Official Judge" or "Round".

But to make it simple and considering feature importance, perhaps using "Judge" as the first split and "Official Judge" as the second split would be logical.

So, the tree might look like:

- If Judge is E. Williams:
  - If Official: Class Lewis
  - Else: Class Holyfield
- Else if Judge is L. O'Connell:
  - If Official: Class Holyfield
  - Else: Class Lewis
- And so on for each judge.

But without knowing the tendencies of each judge, this is speculative. Alternatively, maybe the first split is based on "Official Judge" and then within that, split by Round or Judge.

Wait, but the user wants to use the most important features, which I assumed were "Judge" and then "Official". But perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternatively, the root could be "Round", splitting into early rounds (1-6) and late rounds (7-12). Then within each round group, split based on whether the judge is official or not. For example:

- If Round <= 6:
  - If Official: Class Holyfield
  - Else: Class Lewis
- Else:
  - If Official: Class Lewis
  - Else: Class Holyfield

This way, it's considering that in early rounds, one fighter might be stronger when the judge is official, and in later rounds, the other might take over.

But again, without data, this is speculative. However, given the example provided by the user with the Iris dataset, they split on petal width twice. So maybe for our case, splitting on "Judge" first, then within that, splitting on whether they're official makes sense.

Alternatively, using "Official Judge" as the root could be better because it's a binary feature and might have higher importance in predicting the outcome. But I'm not sure.

In any case, the key is to build a tree with maximum depth 2, so two decision nodes after the root. The features are Judge (categorical), Official (binary), and Round (ordinal).

I think using "Judge" as the first split makes sense because each judge's tendencies can be a strong predictor. Then, within each judge, splitting on whether they're official could further refine the prediction.

So, the tree would look like:

1. Root: Judge
   - If Judge is E. Williams:
     - Decision Node: Official (yes/no)
       - Yes: Class Lewis
       - No: Class Holyfield
   - If Judge is L. O'Connell:
     - Decision Node: Official (yes/no)
       - Yes: Class Holyfield
       - No: Class Lewis
   - And similarly for other judges.

But since the user didn't provide data, I can't know each judge's tendencies, so this is a hypothetical tree. Alternatively, perhaps using "Round" as the second split would make more sense if Round has a natural order that affects the outcome.

Alternatively, maybe:

- Root: Official (yes/no)
  - If Yes:
    - Decision Node: Round <=6
      - Class Holyfield
    - Else:
      - Class Lewis
  - If No:
    - Decision Node: Judge is E. Williams or not.
      - If E. Williams: Class Lewis
      - Else: Class Holyfield

But again, without data, it's hard to choose.

Given all that, I think the most logical approach is to use "Judge" as the root because it's a high-cardinality feature with each judge potentially having unique tendencies. Then, within each judge, split based on whether they're an official judge or not.

Therefore, the decision tree would first check which judge it is, then for that specific judge, determine if they are an official judge to classify the winner of the round.

To build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 using the provided features (Judge, Official Judge, Round), we'll structure the tree based on the most influential features. Here's how it looks:

```
Decision Tree:
|--- Judge: E. Williams
||--- Official Judge: yes → class: Lewis
||--- Official Judge: no → class: Holyfield
|--- Judge: L. O'Connell
||--- Official Judge: yes → class: Holyfield
||--- Official Judge: no → class: Lewis
|--- Judge: S. Christodoulu
||--- Official Judge: yes → class: Lewis
||--- Official Judge: no → class: Holyfield
|--- Judge: HBO-Lederman
||--- Official Judge: yes → class: Holyfield
||--- Official Judge: no → class: Lewis
|--- Judge: Sportsticker
||--- Official Judge: yes → class: Lewis
||--- Official Judge: no → class: Holyfield
|--- Judge: Other Judges
    |--- Official Judge: yes → class: Lewis
    |--- Official Judge: no → class: Holyfield
```

**Explanation:**
- The root node splits based on the "Judge" feature, considering each judge's potential tendencies.
- Each subsequent node within a specific judge splits further using the "Official Judge" feature to classify the round winner.

This structure effectively uses the high-cardinality of the "Judge" feature and refines predictions with the binary "Official Judge" attribute.

Alright, I need to create a Python function based on the given decision tree that predicts whether Holyfield won the round and also returns a list of truth values for each inner node. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, looking at the features provided: 'Judge', 'Official', 'Round', 'Target variable', and 'target'. But wait, the target variable is what we're predicting, so I should focus on 'Judge', 'Official', and 'Round' as the input features. The description also gives me their encodings.

The target variable is 'target': 1 if Lewis won, 0 if Holyfield did. So our function needs to return a prediction of either 0 or 1 based on these features.

Next, I need to structure the decision tree. Since it's not provided, I have to make assumptions. Maybe the tree considers whether the judge is official and certain rounds are pivotal. For example, in later rounds, if an official judge scores, it might indicate a win for Lewis.

So, let's outline possible conditions:

1. Check if 'Official' is 1 (yes). If not, perhaps default to Holyfield winning.
2. Then check the round number. Maybe after round 8, Lewis is more likely to have won.
3. Based on these two checks, decide the winner.

Now, I'll structure this into a function. The function takes X as input and returns prediction and nodes. Nodes will track whether each condition was met (1) or not (0).

I'll set up two inner nodes: one for 'Official' being 1, another for 'Round' >=8. Then, based on these, decide the outcome.

Testing with sample inputs would help validate this logic. For example:

- If Official=0 and Round=5 → prediction is 0 (Holyfield).
- If Official=1 and Round=9 → prediction is 1 (Lewis).

This seems logical. I'll code it accordingly.
</think>

Here's a decision tree function that predicts whether Holyfield won the round based on the features 'Judge', 'Official', and 'Round':

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None, None]  # Two inner nodes
    
    # First condition: Whether the judge is official
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # 1 if the judge is an official judge, 0 otherwise
    
    # Second condition: Whether we are in a later round (e.g., Round >= 8)
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] >= 8      # 1 if late-round, 0 otherwise
    
    # Decision logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If the judge is an official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # And it's a later round
            prediction = 1  # Predict Holyfield won the round
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Predict Lewis won the round
    else:  # If the judge is not an official judge
        prediction = 0  # Default prediction (could be adjusted based on data)
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function makes predictions based on two conditions:

1. Whether the judge is an official judge (`Official`).
2. Whether we are in a later round (`Round >= 8`).

The tree structure assumes that official judges' scores might be more indicative of Holyfield's performance in later rounds, while non-official judges might lean toward Lewis. The function returns both the prediction (0 for Lewis, 1 for Holyfield) and a list indicating whether each condition was met (1 if true, 0 otherwise).
