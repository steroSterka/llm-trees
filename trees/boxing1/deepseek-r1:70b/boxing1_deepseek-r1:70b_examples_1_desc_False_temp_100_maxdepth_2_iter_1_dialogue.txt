Okay, so I need to build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2. The goal is to classify which boxer won each round between Lewis and Holyfield based on the given features: Judge, Official judge, and Round.

First, let me understand the problem. We have rounds from 1 to 12, each judged by different sources (like E. Williams, L. O'Connell, etc.), and whether they are official judges or not. The tree should decide for each round who won based on these features.

Since the maximum depth is 2, the tree can have at most two levels of splits. That means I'll need to choose the most important feature first, split the data based on that feature, then within each subset, use another feature to make the final classification.

I should start by selecting the root node, which will be the most important feature. Looking at the features: Judge, Official judge, and Round. I think "Official judge" might be a strong indicator because official judges' opinions are more authoritative. Alternatively, the number of rounds could also be a factor since later rounds might have different dynamics.

Wait, but in the example provided for the Iris dataset, petal width was chosen as the first split. So maybe I should look at which feature is most discriminative between Lewis and Holyfield's wins. Maybe "Official judge" is yes or no, so that could be a good starting point because official judges might have a more consistent or accurate scoring.

So let me make "Offical judge (yes / no)" the root node. If it's yes, then in one branch, we go to another feature; if it's no, the other branch does the same.

Now, for each of these branches, I need to choose another feature. Let's see, if the first split is on "Official judge," then within that, maybe the number of "Judge" sources or the Round number could be the next split.

Alternatively, perhaps the Round itself is important because certain rounds might consistently favor one boxer. For example, later rounds (like 11 and 12) might have been where Lewis took over if he won by a late surge.

But I'm not sure about that. Maybe it's better to look at the number of judges who are official vs non-official. Wait, no, because each round is scored individually by multiple judges. But the features here are per-round, so for each round, we have which judges (like E. Williams, etc.) and whether they're official.

Wait, actually, I think "Judge" in this context refers to who provided the score for that particular round. So each row represents a round judged by one of these Judges, with some being official and others not. The target is to classify which fighter won the round: Lewis or Holyfield.

But wait, the features are per judge per round? Or is it that each round has multiple judges, but the features here represent the attributes for that round's judging?

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of each instance as a round, with the features being:

- Judge: which specific person or entity judged this round.
- Official judge: yes/no indicating if this judge is an official one.
- Round: the number of the round (1 to 12).

So for each round, we have these three features. The decision tree should predict who won that round based on these.

Given that, I think "Official judge" could be a good first split because official judges might lean towards one fighter more than others. Alternatively, the Round number itself might indicate patterns in scoring.

But let's proceed with "Official judge" as root since it's a binary feature and likely to have a strong correlation.

So first split: Official judge = yes or no.

Now, within each of these, we need another feature. Let's say for "yes," the next split could be Round > 6, assuming that official judges might have given more rounds to Lewis in later rounds if he dominated there. Alternatively, it could be based on the number of Judges agreeing, but since each row is a single judge's score per round, perhaps the Round itself is better.

Alternatively, for "no," maybe non-official judges (like HBO-Lederman or others) might have their own biases.

Wait, but without data, this is all assumption. I need to make educated guesses based on typical decision tree approaches.

So, under "Official judge = yes", perhaps split on Round > 6: if so, Lewis won; else, Holyfield.

Under "Official judge = no", maybe split on the Judge being HBO-Lederman or not. If it's HBO-Lederman, maybe they favored Holyfield more. Alternatively, another split could be made based on Round again, but with a different threshold.

But since I have to choose, let me structure it as:

- Root: Official judge (yes / no)
   - Yes branch:
       - Split on Round > 6: if yes, Lewis; else, Holyfield
   - No branch:
       - Split on Judge: perhaps HBO-Lederman vs others. If HBO-Lederman, maybe they favored Holyfield.

Wait, but in the example for Iris, after petal width, it splits again based on another feature. So following that structure.

Alternatively, to keep it consistent, I can split both branches using Round > 6.

But perhaps non-official judges are more varied, so splitting on Judge might make sense there.

Let me think of an example tree:

- If Official judge = yes:
   - If Round > 6 → Lewis
   - Else → Holyfield

- If Official judge = no:
   - If Judge is HBO-Lederman → Holyfield
   - Else → based on some other feature, but since max depth is 2, we can't go further. So perhaps default to the majority.

But maybe it's better to split non-official judges by Round as well, say Round > 6 leads to Lewis, else Holyfield.

Wait, that might not make sense because non-official judges could have different tendencies.

Alternatively, for the "no" branch, split on Round <=6 → Holyfield, else Lewis.

But without data, it's hard. So perhaps a possible tree is:

Decision Tree:
|--- Official judge = yes
||--- Round > 6: class = Lewis
||--- Round <=6: class = Holyfield
|--- Official judge = no
||--- Round > 6: class = Lewis
||--- Round <=6: class = Holyfield

But that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, for the non-official branch, maybe Judge is a better split.

Alternatively:

Decision Tree:
|--- Official judge = yes
||--- Round > 6 → Lewis
||--- Round <=6 → Holyfield
|--- Official judge = no
||--- HBO-Lederman = yes → Holyfield
||--- HBO-Lederman = no → Lewis

That way, we're using Judge as the second split in non-official cases.

I think that makes sense because perhaps HBO-Lederman might have had a bias towards Holyfield.

So final tree:

- Root: Official judge (yes / no)
   - If yes:
       - Split on Round >6 → Lewis else Holyfield
   - If no:
       - Split on Judge = HBO-Lederman → Holyfield else Lewis

I think that's a reasonable approach given the constraints.
</think>

The decision tree is structured to classify which boxer won each round based on whether the judge was official and additional criteria for non-official judges. Here's how it looks:

|--- Official judge = yes
||--- Round > 6: class = Lewis
||--- Round <=6: class = Holyfield
|--- Official judge = no
||--- HBO-Lederman = yes → Holyfield
||--- HBO-Lederman = no → Lewis

This tree first splits on whether the judge is official, then further splits based on round number for officials and specific judge identity for non-officials.

Okay, I need to format a decision tree as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes. The user provided an example function, so I should follow that structure.

First, looking at the features, they are 'Judge', 'Official', 'Round', 'Target variable', and 'target'. But wait, the target variable is what we're predicting, so probably 'target' is the key here since it's listed as a feature. The other features like 'Judge' and 'Official' might be used in the decision-making process.

The target variable is whether Lewis or Holyfield won the round, encoded as 1 for Lewis and 0 for Holyfield. So my function needs to predict either 0 or 1 based on the input features.

Now, I need to think about how the decision tree would be structured. The example given had two inner nodes, each checking a condition. So maybe in this case, the tree could have a few layers based on different conditions from the features.

Let me consider possible decision points. Since 'Judge' is a categorical variable with 10 possible values (0-9), it might not be straightforward to split on that directly. Alternatively, 'Round' is a numerical value between 1 and 12, so splitting on whether Round > certain number makes sense. 'Official' is binary (0 or 1), so checking if the judge is official could be another condition.

Putting this together, perhaps the decision tree first checks if the round is greater than a certain threshold, say 6. If yes, then it proceeds to check if the judge is an official. Based on these conditions, it predicts the winner.

Wait, but how do I determine the thresholds? The user mentioned that if there are placeholders for thresholds, try to fill them with meaningful values. So maybe for 'Round', splitting at 6 makes sense because rounds go up to 12, and 6 is halfway. Alternatively, perhaps rounds beyond a certain point (like 7) could indicate something about the fighters' performance.

Alternatively, considering that some judges are officials and others aren't, maybe the first split is on whether the judge is an official or not. If yes, then proceed to check another condition, like the round number.

But since I have to create a function without knowing the exact structure of the tree provided by the user, perhaps I should make an assumption based on logical features. Let me outline a possible decision tree:

1. First, check if 'Round' is greater than 6.
   - If yes (True), then check if 'Official' is 1 (Yes).
     - If both conditions are true, predict Lewis (1).
     - Else, predict Holyfield (0).
   - If no (False), predict Holyfield (0).

But wait, that's just a simple two-level tree with one inner node. The example had two inner nodes. Maybe I need to make it deeper.

Alternatively:

- Node 0: Round > 6
- Node 1: Official == 1

Then the prediction logic could be:
If node 0 is true and node 1 is true, predict 1.
Else if node 0 is false, predict 0.
Else (node 0 true but node 1 false), maybe check another condition, like Judge.

But since I'm supposed to represent this as a function with nodes being the inner conditions, perhaps it's better to have two nodes: one for Round and one for Official.

Wait, in the example provided by the user, they had two nodes. So maybe I should structure mine similarly, using two conditions.

So let me outline:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # First condition: Round > threshold (let's say 6)
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] > 6
    # Second condition: Official is Yes (1)
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins

    return prediction, [int(nodes[0]), int(nodes[1])]

Wait, but in the example, nodes were a list of booleans, and the function returns them as 1s and 0s. So I need to convert each node's boolean value to an integer.

Also, I should ensure that the features used are correctly accessed from the dictionary X with the right keys. The user provided exact feature keys: 'Judge', 'Official', 'Round', etc. But in the function, we're using 'Round' and 'Official'.

So putting it all together, I'll define nodes[0] as Round > 6, which is a meaningful threshold since rounds go up to 12, so 7 and above could be considered later rounds. Then, if that's true, check if the judge is an official (1). If both are true, predict Lewis; else, Holyfield.

I think this makes sense. So the function will evaluate these two conditions and return the prediction along with the node truth values as a list of 0s and 1s.
</think>

To create a decision tree that predicts which fighter won a round based on the given features, we'll structure it to check if the round is in the later half (greater than 6) and whether the judge is an official. Based on these conditions, the prediction will be made.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Initialize a list with two None values
    
    # Check if the round is greater than 6
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] > 6
    
    # Check if the judge is an official (1 means Yes)
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    prediction = 0  # Default prediction is Holyfield wins
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If round > 6
        if nodes[1]:  # And it's an official judge
            prediction = 1  # Predict Lewis wins
            
    return prediction, [int(nodes[0]), int(nodes[1])]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Node 0:** Evaluates if the round number is greater than 6 (`X["Round"] > 6`). This splits the data into early and late rounds.
2. **Node 1:** Checks if the judge is an official (`X["Official"] == 1`), indicating higher credibility or different judging criteria.

**Prediction Logic:**

- If both conditions are true (later round and official judge), predict Lewis wins (1).
- In all other cases, default to predicting Holyfield wins (0).

This tree uses meaningful thresholds and logical checks to make informed predictions based on the given features.
