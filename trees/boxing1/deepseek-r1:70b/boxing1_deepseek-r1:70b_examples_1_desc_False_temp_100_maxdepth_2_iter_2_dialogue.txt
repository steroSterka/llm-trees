Okay, so I need to build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 using the given features: Judge, Official judge, and Round. The goal is to classify which boxer won each round between Lewis and Holyfield.

First, I should understand what each feature represents. "Judge" refers to who the judge is, with possible values like E. Williams, L. O'Connell, etc. "Official judge" is a binary feature indicating whether the judge is an official one or not. "Round" ranges from 1 to 12, indicating which round of the fight we're looking at.

Since the tree can have a maximum depth of 2, it means there will be a root node that splits into two child nodes, and each of those can split once more into grandchildren, making up to four leaf nodes. Each internal node will use one feature to make a decision.

I need to determine which features are most important for predicting the winner. The "Judge" feature is categorical with multiple possible values, so it might be too granular on its own. However, some judges might have biases towards certain fighters, so their judgments could be significant. The "Official judge" seems important because official judges' decisions might carry more weight or be more accurate. The "Round" could indicate patterns in how the fight progressed—maybe one fighter started stronger and the other finished better.

I should consider which feature to use at the root. Since "Official judge" is a binary feature, it's simpler and might provide a clearer split. It makes sense because official judges are more credible, so their decisions could be a strong predictor.

If I split on "Official judge = yes" first, then for those cases where the judge is official, maybe within that group, the next best feature to split would be the Round. If the round is early (say, <=6), perhaps Lewis had better performance in earlier rounds, while Holyfield might have done better in later rounds, or vice versa.

For "Official judge = no", the secondary feature could also be Round. Maybe non-official judges tend to favor one fighter more consistently across all rounds, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's better to split on another feature here, like Judge, but since that's a multi-category variable, it might complicate things. So perhaps using Round again makes sense.

Alternatively, for the second split under each branch, maybe "Judge" could be used, but with so many categories, the tree might not generalize well beyond the training data. Therefore, sticking to numerical features like Round might be better.

So, tentatively, the structure would be:

1. Root: Official judge = yes
   a. If yes, split on Round <=6 → Lewis won
      else (Round >6) → Holyfield won
   b. If no, split on Round <=6 → Holyfield won
      else (Round >6) → Lewis won

Wait, that doesn't make sense because if it's "Official judge = yes", and then Round splits, I have to decide the direction. Maybe official judges tend to score more accurately in later rounds, so perhaps when Official is yes, and Round <=6, Lewis won; else, Holyfield.

But without actual data, it's hard to say. Alternatively, maybe non-official judges might favor Holyfield more across all rounds, but I'm just speculating here.

Another approach: the primary split could be on Round. For example:

1. Root: Round <=6
   a. If yes, then perhaps Lewis won (assuming he started strong)
      else, Holyfield won.
But since maximum depth is 2, the next split can be on Official judge.

Wait, but I'm supposed to use the most important features. Maybe "Official judge" is more predictive than Round. So back to using that as root.

So final structure:

- Root: Official judge = yes
   - Yes branch:
       Split on Round <=6 → Lewis won
       Else → Holyfield won
   - No branch:
       Split on Round <=6 → Holyfield won
       Else → Lewis won

This assumes that official judges are more reliable, so in their case, the outcome depends on whether it's early or late rounds. For non-official judges, perhaps the opposite is true, or maybe it's consistent.

Alternatively, for non-official judges, maybe they tend to favor Holyfield regardless of the round, but I think splitting on Round again makes more sense.

I'm not entirely confident without data, but based on feature importance and simplicity, this structure seems logical.

Based on the features provided, here is a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2:

|--- Official judge: yes
||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: Lewis won
||--- Round > 6
||||--- class: Holyfield won
|--- Official judge: no
||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: Holyfield won
||--- Round > 6
||||--- class: Lewis won

**Explanation:**
- The root node splits on whether the judge is an official one, as this was deemed a significant predictor.
- For official judges, rounds 1-6 are classified as wins for Lewis, while rounds 7-12 favor Holyfield.
- For non-official judges, the classification is reversed, with early rounds going to Holyfield and later rounds to Lewis, possibly indicating different judging criteria.

Okay, so I need to create a Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for predicting which boxer won each round between Lewis and Holyfield. The tree has a maximum depth of 2, meaning there will be at most two layers of decisions before making a prediction.

First, I'll recall the structure of the decision tree we discussed earlier:

1. **Root Node:** Official judge (Yes/No)
   - If Yes:
     - Split on Round <=6 → Lewis won
     - Else → Holyfield won
   - If No:
     - Split on Round <=6 → Holyfield won
     - Else → Lewis won

Now, I need to map this structure into a Python function. The function will take a dictionary `X` containing the features and return two things: the prediction (0 for Holyfield, 1 for Lewis) and a list of truth values representing whether each inner node's condition was met.

Let me think about the steps:

1. **Extract Features:** From the input dictionary `X`, I need to get the values for 'Official' and 'Round'. Note that according to the feature descriptions:
   - 'Official' is encoded as 1 for Yes and 0 for No.
   - 'Round' ranges from 1 to 12.

2. **Define Inner Nodes:** There are two inner nodes in this tree, both at depth 1:
   - Node 0: Whether the judge is official (X['Official'] == 1).
   - Node 1: Whether the round number is less than or equal to 6 (X['Round'] <= 6).

3. **Determine Prediction Based on Nodes:**
   - If Node 0 is true (official judge):
     - If Node 1 is true (round <=6), predict Lewis (1).
     - Else, predict Holyfield (0).
   - If Node 0 is false (not an official judge):
     - If Node 1 is true (round <=6), predict Holyfield (0).
     - Else, predict Lewis (1).

4. **Return Prediction and Nodes:** The function should return the prediction as well as a list where each element is 1 if the corresponding node's condition was met, and 0 otherwise.

Wait, let me double-check: In our initial tree, for official judges in rounds >6, we predict Holyfield (0). For non-official judges in rounds <=6, we predict Holyfield (0), and in rounds >6, Lewis (1).

Yes, that seems correct based on the earlier structure.

Now, to implement this:

- **Step 1:** Extract 'Official' and 'Round' from `X`.
- **Step 2:** Evaluate Node 0 (`official_node = X['Official'] == 1`).
- **Step 3:** Evaluate Node 1 (`round_node = X['Round'] <= 6`).
- **Step 4:** Based on the nodes, decide the prediction.
- **Step 5:** Create a list `nodes` where each element is 1 if the condition was met, else 0.

Wait, but in our tree structure, Node 0 checks for official judges. So:

If official (Node 0 is true):
    If round <=6 (Node 1 is true): predict Lewis (1)
    Else: predict Holyfield (0)
Else:
    If round <=6 (Node 1 is true): predict Holyfield (0)
    Else: predict Lewis (1)

But in the function, we need to represent this logic correctly.

Also, pay attention to how the nodes are represented. The list should have two elements corresponding to Node 0 and Node 1, respectively.

Let me think about potential issues:

- **Feature Extraction:** Ensure that 'Official' is an integer (1 or 0) as per encoding.
- **Round Handling:** Make sure that 'Round' is treated as an integer between 1 and 12.
- **Boolean to Integer Conversion:** Convert the boolean results of node conditions to integers (True → 1, False → 0).

Let me outline the code step by step:

def predict(X: dict):
    # Extract relevant features
    official = X['Official']
    round_num = X['Round']

    # Evaluate inner nodes
    nodes = []
    node0 = official == 1  # True if official judge
    node1 = round_num <= 6

    nodes.append(1 if node0 else 0)
    nodes.append(1 if node1 else 0)

    # Determine prediction based on nodes
    if node0:
        if node1:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:
        if node1:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis

    return prediction, nodes

Wait a minute. I think the node evaluations should be based on the conditions as per the tree structure.

But in this code, Node 0 is checking if 'Official' ==1, which aligns with our tree's root node splitting on official judges.

Then, Node 1 checks if 'Round' <=6, which is used in both branches of the tree.

This should correctly implement the decision logic we've outlined.

Testing this function with some example inputs would be good to ensure it behaves as expected.
</think>

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting which boxer won each round between Holyfield and Lewis based on whether the judge was official and the round number:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Extract relevant features from the input dictionary
    official = X['Official']
    round_num = X['Round']

    # Evaluate conditions for inner nodes
    node0 = (official == 1)
    node1 = (round_num <= 6)

    # Convert boolean values to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0) for the nodes list
    nodes = [int(node0), int(node1)]

    # Determine prediction based on the evaluated conditions
    if official == 1:
        if round_num <= 6:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
    else:
        if round_num <= 6:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Feature Extraction:** The function extracts the 'Official' and 'Round' values from the input dictionary `X`.
2. **Node Evaluation:** It evaluates two conditions (nodes):
   - Node 0 checks if the judge is official.
   - Node 1 checks if the round number is less than or equal to 6.
3. **Prediction Logic:** Based on the node evaluations, the function predicts the winner:
   - If the judge is official and the round is ≤6, Lewis wins (prediction = 1).
   - If the judge is official and the round is >6, Holyfield wins (prediction = 0).
   - If the judge is not official and the round is ≤6, Holyfield wins (prediction = 0).
   - If the judge is not official and the round is >6, Lewis wins (prediction = 1).
4. **Return Values:** The function returns the predicted winner and a list indicating whether each node's condition was met.

This implementation accurately reflects the decision tree structure and ensures that predictions are made based on the specified conditions.
