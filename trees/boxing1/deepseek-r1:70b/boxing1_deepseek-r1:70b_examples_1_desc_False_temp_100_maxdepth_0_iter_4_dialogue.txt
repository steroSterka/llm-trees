Alright, I need to help the user build a decision tree classifier using the given features to determine which boxer, Lewis or Holyfield, won each round. The user provided an example with sepal and petal features, so they're familiar with that structure.

First, let's look at the new set of features: Judge, Official judge (yes/no), and Round (1-12). My goal is to use these to classify the winner of each round.

I should start by considering the most important feature. The 'Judge' seems crucial because different judges might have biases or preferences that could influence their scoring. There are multiple judges listed: E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu, HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, Boxing Times, Sportsline, Associated Press, ESPN, and Boxing Monthly-Leach.

Next, I think about how to split these judges into groups. Maybe group them based on their tendencies. For example, some might favor Lewis more, others Holyfield, or perhaps some are neutral. But without specific data on each judge's bias, it's challenging. So, maybe I'll create a primary split based on whether the judge is an 'Official' or not.

Wait, but looking at the features again, there's an 'Offical judge (yes / no)' feature. That could be more straightforward. Maybe I should start with that. If the judge is official, perhaps their decision is more reliable. So, the first split would be on whether it's an official judge.

If it's yes, then within that node, I can look at specific judges. For example, HBO-Lederman and ESPN might have certain tendencies, so further splits based on these judges could lead to classifications of Lewis or Holyfield winning.

On the other hand, if it's not an official judge, maybe Round number becomes more important. Early rounds (1-4) might be more about feeling each other out, so perhaps Lewis, known for his strength, might have an edge. Middle rounds (5-8) could be competitive, so it's a toss-up. Late rounds (9-12) might see Holyfield's endurance shine, leading to him winning those.

I should also consider the depth of the tree. It shouldn't be too complex, but detailed enough to capture key distinctions. So, after splitting on 'Official judge,' I can split further based on specific judges and then Round numbers.

Putting it all together, the decision tree starts with 'Offical judge.' If yes, check if it's a specific influential judge like HBO-Lederman or ESPN, leading to a winner. If no, use the Round number to decide based on when in the fight it is.

I should make sure each path logically leads to a classification without overlapping conditions. This way, any given round can be classified by following the tree from top to bottom.

Based on the provided features and the structure of decision trees you've shared, I'll attempt to create a decision tree classifier to predict which boxer (Lewis or Holyfield) won each round based on the given features: `Judge`, `Offical judge (yes / no)`, and `Round`.

Here's the decision tree:

```
|--- Official Judge: yes
||--- Judge: HBO-Lederman
|||--- class: Lewis
||--- Judge: ESPN
|||--- class: Holyfield
||--- Judge: E. Williams / L. O'Connell / S. Christodoulu / Sportsticker / Boxing Times / Sportsline / Associated Press / Boxing Monthly-Leach
||||--- Round <= 6
|||||--- class: Lewis
||||--- Round > 6
|||||--- class: Holyfield
|--- Official Judge: no
||--- Round <= 4
|||--- class: Lewis
||--- Round > 4 and Round <= 8
(|||--- class: Holyfield
||--- Round > 8
||||--- class: Lewis
```

### Explanation:
1. **Root Node**: The first split is based on whether the judge is an official judge (`Official Judge: yes / no`).
2. **If Official Judge = yes**:
   - Further splits are based on the specific judge and round number.
   - If the judge is HBO-Lederman or ESPN, the outcome is directly determined as "Lewis" or "Holyfield," respectively.
   - For other official judges, the outcome depends on the round number:
     - Rounds 1-6: Lewis
     - Rounds 7-12: Holyfield
3. **If Official Judge = no**:
   - The decision is based purely on the round number:
     - Rounds 1-4: Lewis
     - Rounds 5-8: Holyfield
     - Rounds 9-12: Lewis

This tree reflects a simplified approach to classifying the winner of each round based on the influence of official judges and the progression of the fight through the rounds.

Alright, I need to create a Python function that mimics the decision tree I built earlier for predicting whether Lewis or Holyfield won a boxing round. The function should take a dictionary of features as input and return both the predicted outcome and a list indicating which inner nodes' conditions were met.

First, I'll look at the features provided: 'Judge', 'Official', and 'Round'. Each has specific encodings:

- **Judge**: Ranges from 0 to 9, representing different judges.
- **Official**: Binary (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
- **Round**: Integers from 1 to 12.

The target variable is whether Lewis or Holyfield won the round, encoded as 1 for Lewis and 0 for Holyfield.

Next, I need to translate my decision tree into conditional checks within the function. The tree has the following structure:

1. Check if the judge is an official one (`Official == 1`).
   - If yes:
     - Further split based on specific judges (HBO-Lederman: 3, ESPN:8) and round numbers.
   - If no:
     - Decision based solely on the round number.

I'll map each decision node into boolean checks. For example:

- Node 0: `Official == 1`
- Node 1: `Judge == 3` (HBO-Lederman)
- Node 2: `Round <= 6`
- Node 3: `Official == 0`
- Node 4: `Round <= 4`
- Node 5: `Round > 8`

I'll assign these checks to a list called `nodes`, where each entry is the result of evaluating that condition. Then, based on the sequence of true (1) or false (0) in this list, I'll determine the prediction.

It's important to handle all possible paths through the decision tree within the function. For example, if a sample doesn't meet the initial condition (`Official == 1`), it should follow the non-official judge path and use round numbers to make the prediction.

I also need to ensure that all nodes are evaluated correctly. Since some conditions depend on previous ones being true, I'll structure the if-elif statements carefully to reflect the tree's hierarchy.

Finally, after determining the prediction (0 or 1), I'll return it along with the list of node evaluations as integers (1 for True, 0 for False).

Testing this function with sample inputs would help verify its correctness. For instance:

- If `Official` is 1 and `Judge` is 3 (`HBO-Lederman`), the prediction should be Lewis (1).
- If `Official` is 1, `Judge` is 8 (`ESPN`), the prediction should be Holyfield (0).
- For non-official judges, rounds 1-4 should favor Lewis, 5-8 Holyfield, and 9-12 back to Lewis.

This structured approach ensures that each condition is checked in sequence, and the correct prediction is made based on the decision tree logic.

Here's a Python function implementing the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 6  # Initialize list to store node evaluations
    
    # Node 0: Check if Official is Yes (1)
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    prediction = None
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Check if Judge is HBO-Lederman (3)
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            # Node 2: Check if Round <=6
            nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
            
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:
        # Node 3: Check if Official is No (0)
        nodes[3] = X["Official"] == 0
        
        if nodes[3]:
            # Node 4: Check if Round <=4
            nodes[4] = X["Round"] <= 4
            
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                # Node 5: Check if Round >8
                nodes[5] = X["Round"] > 8
                
                if nodes[5]:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    
    # Convert boolean values in nodes to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) if node is not None else 0 for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **Nodes**: Each node represents a condition check in the decision tree. The function evaluates these conditions sequentially.
- **Prediction Logic**: 
  - If the judge is official (`nodes[0]` is True), further checks determine if it's HBO-Lederman or another judge, and then uses round numbers to predict.
  - For non-official judges, the prediction is based solely on the round number ranges.
- **Output**: The function returns the predicted winner (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) and a list of 0s and 1s indicating which nodes were satisfied during evaluation.

This implementation ensures that each condition is evaluated in the correct order, mirroring the structure of the decision tree.
