A new challenge!

Based on the features you provided, I will build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 to classify which of the two boxing fighters (Lewis and Holyfield) won each round.

First, let's analyze the features:

* Judge: This feature has multiple categories, but we can try to group them into more general categories. For example, we can group "Official judge" as one category and all other judges as another category.
* Official judge: This is a binary feature that indicates whether the judge is an official judge or not.
* Round: This is a numerical feature that ranges from 1 to 12.

After analyzing the features, I will build the decision tree using the most important features. Here is the result:

|--- Judge = Official judge
||--- class: Lewis (i.e., Lewis won the round)
|--- Judge != Official judge
||--- Round <= 6
|||--- class: Holyfield (i.e., Holyfield won the round)
||--- Round > 6
|||--- class: Lewis

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* If the judge is an official judge, then Lewis is likely to win the round.
* If the judge is not an official judge, then we need to consider the round number. If the round number is less than or equal to 6, Holyfield is likely to win the round. Otherwise, Lewis is likely to win the round.

Note that this decision tree has a maximum depth of 2 and uses only two features: Judge and Round. The feature "Official judge" was not used as a separate node in the tree because it's already captured by the Judge feature.

Based on the decision tree I previously built, here is the Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins

    return prediction, nodes
```

In this function, `X` is a dictionary containing the feature values. The function first evaluates the inner nodes and stores their truth values in the `nodes` list. Then, it uses these node values to determine the final prediction.

Note that I used the exact keys of the features as specified, and also paid close attention to the target value encoding (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield).
