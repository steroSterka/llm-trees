Based on the features you provided, I will attempt to build a decision tree classifier that predicts which of the two boxing fighters (Lewis and Holyfield) won each round.

Here is the induced decision tree:

|--- Official judge == yes
||--- Judge in ['E. Williams', 'L. O'Connell', 'S. Christodoulu']
|||--- class: Lewis
||--- Judge in ['HBO-Lederman', 'Sportsticker', 'Boxing Times', 'Sportsline', 'Associated Press', 'ESPN', 'Boxing Monthly-Leach']
|||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: Holyfield
||||--- Round > 6
|||||--- class: Lewis
||--- Judge in ['HBO-Lederman', 'Sportsticker', 'Boxing Times', 'Sportsline', 'Associated Press', 'ESPN', 'Boxing Monthly-Leach']
|||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: Holyfield
||||--- Round > 6
|||||--- class: Lewis
|--- Official judge == no
||--- Judge in ['E. Williams', 'L. O'Connell', 'S. Christodoulu']
|||--- Round <= 4
||||--- class: Holyfield
||||--- Round > 4
|||||--- class: Lewis
||--- Judge in ['HBO-Lederman', 'Sportsticker', 'Boxing Times', 'Sportsline', 'Associated Press', 'ESPN', 'Boxing Monthly-Leach']
|||--- Round <= 8
||||--- class: Holyfield
||||--- Round > 8
|||||--- class: Lewis

This decision tree uses the following features:

* Official judge (yes/no)
* Judge (E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu, HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, Boxing Times, Sportsline, Associated Press, ESPN, Boxing Monthly-Leach)
* Round (1 to 12)

The tree predicts the winner of each round based on these features.

Please note that this decision tree is not necessarily optimal and may not accurately classify all instances. The accuracy of the tree depends on the quality of the training data and the specific characteristics of the problem.

Based on the features you provided, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict which boxer won each round. Here's the decision tree:

|--- Judge in (S. Christodoulu, Boxing Monthly-Leach)
||--- class: Holyfield
|--- Judge not in (S. Christodoulu, Boxing Monthly-Leach)
||--- Official judge = yes
|||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: Lewis
||||--- Round > 6
|||||--- class: Holyfield
||--- Official judge = no
||||--- Judge in (E. Williams, L. O'Connell)
|||||--- class: Lewis
||||--- Judge not in (E. Williams, L. O'Connell)
||||||--- class: Holyfield

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* If the judge is either S. Christodoulu or Boxing Monthly-Leach, the class is likely to be Holyfield.
* If the judge is not one of the above and is an official judge, then:
	+ If the round is 6 or earlier, the class is likely to be Lewis.
	+ If the round is later than 6, the class is likely to be Holyfield.
* If the judge is not an official judge, then:
	+ If the judge is either E. Williams or L. O'Connell, the class is likely to be Lewis.
	+ Otherwise, the class is likely to be Holyfield.

Note that this decision tree is based on the assumption that the features are relevant and there are no missing values. In a real-world scenario, you would want to validate the model using techniques such as cross-validation and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    
    # Inner node 0: Official judge == yes
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Inner node 1: Judge in ['E. Williams', 'L. O'Connell', 'S. Christodoulu']
    judges = [0, 1, 2]
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in judges
    
    # Inner node 2: Round <= 6
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    # Inner node 3: Judge in ['HBO-Lederman', 'Sportsticker', 'Boxing Times', 'Sportsline', 'Associated Press', 'ESPN', 'Boxing Monthly-Leach']
    judges = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] in judges
    
    # Inner node 4: Round <= 8
    nodes[4] = X["Round"] <= 8
    
    # Inner node 5: Round <= 4
    nodes[5] = X["Round"] <= 4

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 1
                
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the features as input and returns the predicted class label (either 0 or 1) and a list of truth values representing the inner nodes of the decision tree.

Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Judge in (S. Christodoulu, Boxing Monthly-Leach)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [2, 9]
    
    # Official judge = yes
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Round <= 6
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    # Judge in (E. Williams, L. O'Connell)
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1]
    
    # Default node value to avoid index error
    nodes[4] = None
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes[:4]]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features as input and returns a tuple with two values:

1. The predicted class (either 0 for Holyfield or 1 for Lewis).
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Note that I used integer values to represent the Judge feature, assuming the encoding provided in your description. Also, I filled the threshold for Round <= 6 with a meaningful value based on the problem context.
