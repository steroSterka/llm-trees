Based on the features you provided, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict which boxer won each round. Here's the decision tree:

|--- Judge in (S. Christodoulu, Boxing Monthly-Leach)
||--- class: Holyfield
|--- Judge not in (S. Christodoulu, Boxing Monthly-Leach)
||--- Official judge = yes
|||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: Lewis
||||--- Round > 6
|||||--- class: Holyfield
||--- Official judge = no
||||--- Judge in (E. Williams, L. O'Connell)
|||||--- class: Lewis
||||--- Judge not in (E. Williams, L. O'Connell)
||||||--- class: Holyfield

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* If the judge is either S. Christodoulu or Boxing Monthly-Leach, the class is likely to be Holyfield.
* If the judge is not one of the above and is an official judge, then:
	+ If the round is 6 or earlier, the class is likely to be Lewis.
	+ If the round is later than 6, the class is likely to be Holyfield.
* If the judge is not an official judge, then:
	+ If the judge is either E. Williams or L. O'Connell, the class is likely to be Lewis.
	+ Otherwise, the class is likely to be Holyfield.

Note that this decision tree is based on the assumption that the features are relevant and there are no missing values. In a real-world scenario, you would want to validate the model using techniques such as cross-validation and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Judge in (S. Christodoulu, Boxing Monthly-Leach)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [2, 9]
    
    # Official judge = yes
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Round <= 6
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    # Judge in (E. Williams, L. O'Connell)
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1]
    
    # Default node value to avoid index error
    nodes[4] = None
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes[:4]]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features as input and returns a tuple with two values:

1. The predicted class (either 0 for Holyfield or 1 for Lewis).
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Note that I used integer values to represent the Judge feature, assuming the encoding provided in your description. Also, I filled the threshold for Round <= 6 with a meaningful value based on the problem context.
