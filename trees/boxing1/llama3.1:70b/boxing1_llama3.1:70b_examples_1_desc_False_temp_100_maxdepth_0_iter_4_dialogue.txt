Based on the features you provided, I will attempt to build a decision tree classifier that predicts which of the two boxing fighters (Lewis and Holyfield) won each round.

Here is the induced decision tree:

|--- Official judge == yes
||--- Judge in ['E. Williams', 'L. O'Connell', 'S. Christodoulu']
|||--- class: Lewis
||--- Judge in ['HBO-Lederman', 'Sportsticker', 'Boxing Times', 'Sportsline', 'Associated Press', 'ESPN', 'Boxing Monthly-Leach']
|||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: Holyfield
||||--- Round > 6
|||||--- class: Lewis
||--- Judge in ['HBO-Lederman', 'Sportsticker', 'Boxing Times', 'Sportsline', 'Associated Press', 'ESPN', 'Boxing Monthly-Leach']
|||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: Holyfield
||||--- Round > 6
|||||--- class: Lewis
|--- Official judge == no
||--- Judge in ['E. Williams', 'L. O'Connell', 'S. Christodoulu']
|||--- Round <= 4
||||--- class: Holyfield
||||--- Round > 4
|||||--- class: Lewis
||--- Judge in ['HBO-Lederman', 'Sportsticker', 'Boxing Times', 'Sportsline', 'Associated Press', 'ESPN', 'Boxing Monthly-Leach']
|||--- Round <= 8
||||--- class: Holyfield
||||--- Round > 8
|||||--- class: Lewis

This decision tree uses the following features:

* Official judge (yes/no)
* Judge (E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu, HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, Boxing Times, Sportsline, Associated Press, ESPN, Boxing Monthly-Leach)
* Round (1 to 12)

The tree predicts the winner of each round based on these features.

Please note that this decision tree is not necessarily optimal and may not accurately classify all instances. The accuracy of the tree depends on the quality of the training data and the specific characteristics of the problem.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    
    # Inner node 0: Official judge == yes
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Inner node 1: Judge in ['E. Williams', 'L. O'Connell', 'S. Christodoulu']
    judges = [0, 1, 2]
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in judges
    
    # Inner node 2: Round <= 6
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    # Inner node 3: Judge in ['HBO-Lederman', 'Sportsticker', 'Boxing Times', 'Sportsline', 'Associated Press', 'ESPN', 'Boxing Monthly-Leach']
    judges = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] in judges
    
    # Inner node 4: Round <= 8
    nodes[4] = X["Round"] <= 8
    
    # Inner node 5: Round <= 4
    nodes[5] = X["Round"] <= 4

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 1
                
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the features as input and returns the predicted class label (either 0 or 1) and a list of truth values representing the inner nodes of the decision tree.
