Based on the provided features, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict which boxer won each round. Here's the resulting tree:

|--- Judge in [S. Christodoulu, Boxing Monthly-Leach, ESPN]
||--- class: Holyfield
|--- Judge in [E. Williams, L. O'Connell, HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, Boxing Times, Sportsline, Associated Press]
||--- Offical judge == yes
|||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: Lewis
||||--- Round > 6
|||||--- class: Holyfield
||--- Offical judge == no
|||--- Judge in [E. Williams, L. O'Connell]
||||--- class: Lewis
||||--- Judge in [HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, Boxing Times, Sportsline, Associated Press]
|||||--- class: Holyfield

This decision tree uses the following features to classify which boxer won each round:

1. **Judge**: The judge's identity is used as the primary splitting criterion. Certain judges (S. Christodoulu, Boxing Monthly-Leach, and ESPN) tend to favor Holyfield.
2. **Offical judge**: If the judge is an official judge, the decision tree splits based on the round number.
3. **Round**: For official judges who are not biased towards Holyfield, rounds 1-6 tend to favor Lewis, while rounds 7-12 tend to favor Holyfield.

Please note that this decision tree might not be perfect and may have some errors due to the limited feature set and potential biases in the data.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [2, 8, 9]  # S. Christodoulu, ESPN, Boxing Monthly-Leach
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1 and X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 0 and X["Judge"] in [0, 1]  # E. Williams, L. O'Connell
    nodes[3] = X["Official"] == 0 and X["Judge"] not in [0, 1]

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    elif nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    elif nodes[2]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield

    return prediction, nodes
```
This function takes a dictionary `X` with the features as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted value (0 for Holyfield, 1 for Lewis) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes. The decision tree is implemented using if-elif statements to follow the structure of the tree.

Note that I've used the encoded values for the `Judge` feature and the `Official` feature as specified in the problem statement.
