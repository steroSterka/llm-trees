Based on the provided features, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict which boxer won each round. Here's the resulting tree:

|--- Judge in [S. Christodoulu, Boxing Monthly-Leach, ESPN]
||--- class: Holyfield
|--- Judge in [E. Williams, L. O'Connell, HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, Boxing Times, Sportsline, Associated Press]
||--- Offical judge == yes
|||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: Lewis
||||--- Round > 6
|||||--- class: Holyfield
||--- Offical judge == no
|||--- Judge in [E. Williams, L. O'Connell]
||||--- class: Lewis
||||--- Judge in [HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, Boxing Times, Sportsline, Associated Press]
|||||--- class: Holyfield

This decision tree uses the following features to classify which boxer won each round:

1. **Judge**: The judge's identity is used as the primary splitting criterion. Certain judges (S. Christodoulu, Boxing Monthly-Leach, and ESPN) tend to favor Holyfield.
2. **Offical judge**: If the judge is an official judge, the decision tree splits based on the round number.
3. **Round**: For official judges who are not biased towards Holyfield, rounds 1-6 tend to favor Lewis, while rounds 7-12 tend to favor Holyfield.

Please note that this decision tree might not be perfect and may have some errors due to the limited feature set and potential biases in the data.
=======
Based on the provided features, I will induce a decision tree classifier. Since this is a classification problem with two classes (Lewis and Holyfield), I'll aim to create a tree that distinguishes between these two classes.

After analyzing the features, here's the induced decision tree:

|--- Judge = HBO-Lederman
||--- class: Lewis
|--- Judge != HBO-Lederman
||--- Official judge = yes
|||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: Holyfield
|||--- Round > 6
||||--- class: Lewis
||--- Official judge = no
|||--- Sportsticker = yes
||||--- class: Lewis
|||--- Sportsticker = no
||||--- Boxing Monthly-Leach = yes
|||||--- class: Holyfield
||||--- Boxing Monthly-Leach = no
||||--- class: Lewis

This decision tree uses the following features:

1. Judge (specifically, HBO-Lederman)
2. Official judge
3. Round
4. Sportsticker
5. Boxing Monthly-Leach

The tree is constructed by recursively partitioning the data based on the most informative feature at each node. The classification accuracy of this tree may not be perfect, but it should provide a reasonable estimate of which boxer won each round.

Please note that the actual performance of this decision tree depends on the specific dataset used to train and test it. If you'd like me to refine or adjust the tree based on additional data or requirements, feel free to let me know!

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [2, 8, 9]  # S. Christodoulu, ESPN, Boxing Monthly-Leach
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1 and X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 0 and X["Judge"] in [0, 1]  # E. Williams, L. O'Connell
    nodes[3] = X["Official"] == 0 and X["Judge"] not in [0, 1]

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    elif nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    elif nodes[2]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield

    return prediction, nodes
```
This function takes a dictionary `X` with the features as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted value (0 for Holyfield, 1 for Lewis) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes. The decision tree is implemented using if-elif statements to follow the structure of the tree.

Note that I've used the encoded values for the `Judge` feature and the `Official` feature as specified in the problem statement.

Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official judge
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 4  # Sportsticker
    nodes[4] = X["Judge"] == 9  # Boxing Monthly-Leach

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    elif nodes[1]:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        elif nodes[4]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values. The function implements the decision tree logic using if-elif statements and returns a tuple containing the predicted class label (0 or 1) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Note that I used `int(node)` to convert each boolean value in the `nodes` list to an integer (0 or 1), as required by the problem statement.
