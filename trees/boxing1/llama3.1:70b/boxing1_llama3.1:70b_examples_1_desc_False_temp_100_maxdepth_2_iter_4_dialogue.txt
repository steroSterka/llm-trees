I cannot generate a decision tree based on the features you provided as they do not relate to each other in any way. The first set of features appears to be related to flowers (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width), while the second set of features is related to boxing matches (Judge, Official judge, Round). 

Additionally, I need more information about how these features relate to the outcome (which fighter won each round) in order to build an accurate decision tree.

However, if you provide me with a dataset that combines these features with the outcome (e.g., Lewis or Holyfield), I can try to induce a decision tree classifier for you. Alternatively, if you clarify how these features relate to the outcome, I may be able to make some educated guesses about how to build a decision tree.

Here is an example of what the dataset might look like:

| Judge        | Official judge | Round | Winner |
|--------------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| E. Williams  | yes             | 1     | Lewis  |
| L. O'Connell | no              | 2     | Holyfield|
| S. Christodoulu | yes           | 3     | Lewis   |

Please provide more information or a sample dataset, and I will do my best to build an accurate decision tree for you!


#########################


Here is the Python function that implements a decision tree of depth 2 to predict which boxer won each round:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 4
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins

    return prediction, [int(nodes[0]), int(nodes[1])]
```

This decision tree uses the "Judge" and "Round" features to predict which boxer won each round. The first node checks if the judge is one of the top 5 judges (E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu, HBO-Lederman, or Sportsticker). If so, Holyfield wins. Otherwise, it checks the round number. If the round number is less than or equal to 6, Lewis wins; otherwise, Holyfield wins.

Note that I've used thresholds of 4 for "Judge" and 6 for "Round", but you may need to adjust these based on your specific dataset. Also, this decision tree assumes that the target variable is encoded as 0 = Holyfield, 1 = Lewis.
