I'll build a decision tree using the features you provided. Here's my attempt:

|--- Judge: HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, Sportsline, Associated Press, ESPN
||--- class: Lewis
|--- Judge: E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu, Boxing Times, Boxing Monthly-Leach
||--- Official judge: yes
|||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: Holyfield
|||--- Round > 6
||||--- class: Lewis
||--- Official judge: no
|||--- Round <= 9
||||--- class: Holyfield
|||--- Round > 9
||||--- class: Lewis

Here's my thought process:

* I first split on the Judge feature, as different judges may have had different biases or scoring tendencies. The HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, Sportsline, Associated Press, and ESPN are generally considered more neutral or pro-Lewis sources.
* Within this branch, I didn't need to split further, as these judges tend to favor Lewis.
* For the other branch (E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu, Boxing Times, Boxing Monthly-Leach), I split on Official judge, as official judges may have had a more significant impact on the scoring.
	+ Within this sub-branch (Official judge: yes), I split on Round, as Holyfield is generally considered to have performed better in earlier rounds. Rounds 1-6 are considered a strong period for Holyfield, while Lewis gained momentum later in the fight.
	+ For Official judge: no, I also split on Round, but with a different threshold (Rounds 1-9). This reflects that even without an official judge, Holyfield may still have had an advantage early on.

Please note that this decision tree is not based on any actual data or boxing expertise. The rules and splits are purely hypothetical and intended to illustrate how a decision tree could be constructed using the provided features.

Would you like me to revise anything or provide further explanations?

I'll build a decision tree using the provided features to classify which of the two boxing fighters (Lewis and Holyfield) won each round.

First, I need to note that since there are only two classes (Lewis and Holyfield), I'll use a binary classification approach. Also, I don't have any data about the actual performance of the fighters in each round, so I'll make some assumptions based on general boxing judging criteria.

Here's the decision tree:
```
|--- Judge: L. O'Connell / S. Christodoulu / HBO-Lederman / Sportsticker / Boxing Times
||--- Round <= 6
|||--- class: Lewis
||--- Round > 6
|||--- class: Holyfield
|--- Judge: E. Williams / Associated Press / ESPN / Boxing Monthly-Leach
||--- Offical judge: yes
|||--- class: Lewis
||--- Offical judge: no
|||--- class: Holyfield
|--- Judge: Sportsline
||--- Round <= 4
|||--- class: Lewis
||--- Round > 4
|||--- class: Holyfield
```
Here's how I built the tree:

1. The first split is based on the judge, as different judges may have different biases or scoring styles. I grouped the judges into three categories:
	* L. O'Connell / S. Christodoulu / HBO-Lederman / Sportsticker / Boxing Times: These judges tend to favor Holyfield in later rounds.
	* E. Williams / Associated Press / ESPN / Boxing Monthly-Leach: These judges tend to favor Lewis, especially if they are official judges.
	* Sportsline: This judge is more neutral and tends to score based on early-round performance.
2. For the first group of judges, I split on Round <= 6, as Holyfield often starts strong but fades in later rounds.
3. For the second group of judges, I split on Offical judge: yes/no, as official judges tend to favor Lewis more strongly.
4. For Sportsline, I split on Round <= 4, as this judge tends to score based on early-round performance.

Note that this decision tree is highly speculative and may not accurately reflect the actual performance of the fighters in each round. In a real-world scenario, you would need more data about the fights, such as punch statistics, ring generalship, and other relevant features, to build an accurate decision tree.

Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree based on the provided features and target variable:

=======
Here is the decision tree as a Python function:
>>>>>>> main

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
<<<<<<< HEAD
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]  # HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, Sportsline, Associated Press, ESPN, Boxing Monthly-Leach
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official judge: Yes
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Early rounds
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 9  # Middle rounds

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

In this implementation, I've used the provided feature encodings and ranges to construct the decision tree. The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes, where `True` is represented by `1` and `False` by `0`. The function returns both the predicted class label (`prediction`) and the list of node truth values.

You can use this function to make predictions on new data points by passing in a dictionary with the relevant features. For example:


```python
X = {"Judge": 3, "Official": 1, "Round": 5}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Holyfield)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 1]
```
=======
    
    # Node 1: Judge in group {L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu, HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, Boxing Times}
    judges_group_1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in judges_group_1
    
    # Node 2: Official judge
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Node 3: Round <= 6
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    # Node 4: Judge is Sportsline and Round <= 4
    judges_sportsline = [6]
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] in judges_sportsline and X["Round"] <= 4

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1 - nodes[2]
    elif nodes[1] or (X["Judge"] == 0):
        prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 1 - nodes[3]

    return int(prediction), nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features as input and returns a tuple of two elements:

* The first element is an integer representing the predicted class label (either 0 for Holyfield or 1 for Lewis).
* The second element is a list of four boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Note that I made some assumptions about the thresholds based on general boxing judging criteria, but these may not be accurate in practice.
