I'll build a decision tree using the provided features to classify which of the two boxing fighters (Lewis and Holyfield) won each round.

First, I need to note that since there are only two classes (Lewis and Holyfield), I'll use a binary classification approach. Also, I don't have any data about the actual performance of the fighters in each round, so I'll make some assumptions based on general boxing judging criteria.

Here's the decision tree:
```
|--- Judge: L. O'Connell / S. Christodoulu / HBO-Lederman / Sportsticker / Boxing Times
||--- Round <= 6
|||--- class: Lewis
||--- Round > 6
|||--- class: Holyfield
|--- Judge: E. Williams / Associated Press / ESPN / Boxing Monthly-Leach
||--- Offical judge: yes
|||--- class: Lewis
||--- Offical judge: no
|||--- class: Holyfield
|--- Judge: Sportsline
||--- Round <= 4
|||--- class: Lewis
||--- Round > 4
|||--- class: Holyfield
```
Here's how I built the tree:

1. The first split is based on the judge, as different judges may have different biases or scoring styles. I grouped the judges into three categories:
	* L. O'Connell / S. Christodoulu / HBO-Lederman / Sportsticker / Boxing Times: These judges tend to favor Holyfield in later rounds.
	* E. Williams / Associated Press / ESPN / Boxing Monthly-Leach: These judges tend to favor Lewis, especially if they are official judges.
	* Sportsline: This judge is more neutral and tends to score based on early-round performance.
2. For the first group of judges, I split on Round <= 6, as Holyfield often starts strong but fades in later rounds.
3. For the second group of judges, I split on Offical judge: yes/no, as official judges tend to favor Lewis more strongly.
4. For Sportsline, I split on Round <= 4, as this judge tends to score based on early-round performance.

Note that this decision tree is highly speculative and may not accurately reflect the actual performance of the fighters in each round. In a real-world scenario, you would need more data about the fights, such as punch statistics, ring generalship, and other relevant features, to build an accurate decision tree.

Here is the decision tree as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Judge in group {L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu, HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, Boxing Times}
    judges_group_1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in judges_group_1
    
    # Node 2: Official judge
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Node 3: Round <= 6
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    # Node 4: Judge is Sportsline and Round <= 4
    judges_sportsline = [6]
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] in judges_sportsline and X["Round"] <= 4

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1 - nodes[2]
    elif nodes[1] or (X["Judge"] == 0):
        prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 1 - nodes[3]

    return int(prediction), nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features as input and returns a tuple of two elements:

* The first element is an integer representing the predicted class label (either 0 for Holyfield or 1 for Lewis).
* The second element is a list of four boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Note that I made some assumptions about the thresholds based on general boxing judging criteria, but these may not be accurate in practice.
