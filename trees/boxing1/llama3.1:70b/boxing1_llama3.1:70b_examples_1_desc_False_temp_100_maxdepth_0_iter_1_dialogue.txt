Based on the features you provided, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict which boxer won each round. Here's the decision tree:

|--- Judge == HBO-Lederman
||--- class: Holyfield
|--- Judge != HBO-Lederman
||--- Offical judge == yes
|||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: Lewis
||||--- Round > 6
|||||--- class: Holyfield
||--- Offical judge == no
|||--- Judge == ESPN
||||--- class: Lewis
||||--- Judge != ESPN
|||||--- Round <= 9
||||||--- class: Lewis
||||||--- Round > 9
|||||||--- class: Holyfield

Here's a brief explanation of the tree:

* The first split is based on the Judge feature, with HBO-Lederman being a strong indicator for Holyfield winning the round.
* For non-HBO-Lederman judges, we consider whether they are an official judge. If they are, Lewis tends to win in the early rounds (1-6), while Holyfield takes over in the later rounds (7-12).
* If the judge is not an official one, we look at the Judge feature again. ESPN seems to favor Lewis, while other non-official judges tend to score in favor of Lewis in the early rounds and Holyfield in the later rounds.

Note that this decision tree is just one possible interpretation of the features and may not be the optimal solution. The actual performance of the classifier would depend on the specific data used for training and testing.

Based on the features you provided, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict which of the two boxing fighters (Lewis and Holyfield) won each round. Here's the resulting decision tree:

|--- Judge: E. Williams
||--- class: Lewis
|--- Judge: L. O'Connell
||--- Round <= 6
|||--- class: Holyfield
||--- Round > 6
|||--- class: Lewis
|--- Official judge: yes
||--- Judge: S. Christodoulou
|||--- class: Lewis
||--- Judge: HBO-Lederman
|||--- Round <= 8
||||--- class: Holyfield
||||--- Round > 8
|||||--- class: Lewis
||--- Judge: Sportsticker / Boxing Times / Sportsline / Associated Press / ESPN / Boxing Monthly-Leach
|||--- class: Lewis

Note that I've used the most important features to build the decision tree. The feature "Official judge" seems to be a strong indicator, as it separates the judges into two groups. Within each group, other features like "Judge" and "Round" are used to make further predictions.

Here's an explanation of the decision tree:

* If the judge is E. Williams, Lewis wins.
* If the judge is L. O'Connell, Holyfield wins in the first 6 rounds, and Lewis wins in the later rounds.
* For official judges (yes), if the judge is S. Christodoulou, Lewis wins.
* For other official judges (HBO-Lederman), if the round is earlier than 8, Holyfield wins; otherwise, Lewis wins.
* For non-official judges (Sportsticker / Boxing Times / Sportsline / Associated Press / ESPN / Boxing Monthly-Leach), Lewis wins.

Keep in mind that this decision tree might not be perfect, as it's based on a limited set of features. You can refine the model by adding more features or using different machine learning algorithms.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:
<<<<<<< HEAD
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Judge == HBO-Lederman
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3
    
    # Node 2: Official judge == yes
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Node 3: Round <= 6
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    # Node 4: Judge == ESPN
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 8
    
    # Node 5: Round > 9
    nodes[4] = X["Round"] > 9
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```
This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values. The function returns a tuple containing the predicted class label (`prediction`) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes (`nodes`).
=======

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 0  # E. Williams
    nodes[1] = (X["Judge"] == 1) and (X["Round"] <= 6)  # L. O'Connell, early rounds
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official judge
    nodes[3] = (nodes[2]) and (X["Judge"] == 2)  # S. Christodoulou
    nodes[4] = (nodes[2]) and (X["Judge"] == 3) and (X["Round"] <= 8)  # HBO-Lederman, early rounds
    nodes[5] = (nodes[2]) and ((X["Judge"] >= 4) or (X["Judge"] <= 9))  # Other official judges
    nodes[6] = (not nodes[0]) and (not nodes[1]) and (not nodes[3]) and (not nodes[4]) and (not nodes[5])

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    elif nodes[1]:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    elif nodes[3]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    elif nodes[4]:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    elif nodes[5]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the features as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted class (0 or 1) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The list is created by converting each boolean value to an integer using the expression `[int(node) for node in nodes]`.
