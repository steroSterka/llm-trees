Based on the features you provided, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict which boxer won each round. Here's the decision tree:

|--- Judge == HBO-Lederman
||--- class: Holyfield
|--- Judge != HBO-Lederman
||--- Offical judge == yes
|||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: Lewis
||||--- Round > 6
|||||--- class: Holyfield
||--- Offical judge == no
|||--- Judge == ESPN
||||--- class: Lewis
||||--- Judge != ESPN
|||||--- Round <= 9
||||||--- class: Lewis
||||||--- Round > 9
|||||||--- class: Holyfield

Here's a brief explanation of the tree:

* The first split is based on the Judge feature, with HBO-Lederman being a strong indicator for Holyfield winning the round.
* For non-HBO-Lederman judges, we consider whether they are an official judge. If they are, Lewis tends to win in the early rounds (1-6), while Holyfield takes over in the later rounds (7-12).
* If the judge is not an official one, we look at the Judge feature again. ESPN seems to favor Lewis, while other non-official judges tend to score in favor of Lewis in the early rounds and Holyfield in the later rounds.

Note that this decision tree is just one possible interpretation of the features and may not be the optimal solution. The actual performance of the classifier would depend on the specific data used for training and testing.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Judge == HBO-Lederman
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3
    
    # Node 2: Official judge == yes
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Node 3: Round <= 6
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    # Node 4: Judge == ESPN
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 8
    
    # Node 5: Round > 9
    nodes[4] = X["Round"] > 9
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```
This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values. The function returns a tuple containing the predicted class label (`prediction`) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes (`nodes`).
