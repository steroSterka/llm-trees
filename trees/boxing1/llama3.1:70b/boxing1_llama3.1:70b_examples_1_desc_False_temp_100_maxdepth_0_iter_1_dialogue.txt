Based on the features you provided, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict which of the two boxing fighters (Lewis and Holyfield) won each round. Here's the resulting decision tree:

|--- Judge: E. Williams
||--- class: Lewis
|--- Judge: L. O'Connell
||--- Round <= 6
|||--- class: Holyfield
||--- Round > 6
|||--- class: Lewis
|--- Official judge: yes
||--- Judge: S. Christodoulou
|||--- class: Lewis
||--- Judge: HBO-Lederman
|||--- Round <= 8
||||--- class: Holyfield
||||--- Round > 8
|||||--- class: Lewis
||--- Judge: Sportsticker / Boxing Times / Sportsline / Associated Press / ESPN / Boxing Monthly-Leach
|||--- class: Lewis

Note that I've used the most important features to build the decision tree. The feature "Official judge" seems to be a strong indicator, as it separates the judges into two groups. Within each group, other features like "Judge" and "Round" are used to make further predictions.

Here's an explanation of the decision tree:

* If the judge is E. Williams, Lewis wins.
* If the judge is L. O'Connell, Holyfield wins in the first 6 rounds, and Lewis wins in the later rounds.
* For official judges (yes), if the judge is S. Christodoulou, Lewis wins.
* For other official judges (HBO-Lederman), if the round is earlier than 8, Holyfield wins; otherwise, Lewis wins.
* For non-official judges (Sportsticker / Boxing Times / Sportsline / Associated Press / ESPN / Boxing Monthly-Leach), Lewis wins.

Keep in mind that this decision tree might not be perfect, as it's based on a limited set of features. You can refine the model by adding more features or using different machine learning algorithms.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 0  # E. Williams
    nodes[1] = (X["Judge"] == 1) and (X["Round"] <= 6)  # L. O'Connell, early rounds
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official judge
    nodes[3] = (nodes[2]) and (X["Judge"] == 2)  # S. Christodoulou
    nodes[4] = (nodes[2]) and (X["Judge"] == 3) and (X["Round"] <= 8)  # HBO-Lederman, early rounds
    nodes[5] = (nodes[2]) and ((X["Judge"] >= 4) or (X["Judge"] <= 9))  # Other official judges
    nodes[6] = (not nodes[0]) and (not nodes[1]) and (not nodes[3]) and (not nodes[4]) and (not nodes[5])

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    elif nodes[1]:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    elif nodes[3]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    elif nodes[4]:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    elif nodes[5]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the features as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted class (0 or 1) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The list is created by converting each boolean value to an integer using the expression `[int(node) for node in nodes]`.
