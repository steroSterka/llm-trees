Based on the provided features, I will attempt to induce a decision tree classifier to predict which boxer won each round. Here's my attempt:

|--- Judge = HBO-Lederman
||--- class: Lewis
|--- Judge != HBO-Lederman
||--- Official judge = yes
|||--- Round <= 6
||||--- class: Holyfield
|||--- Round > 6
||||--- class: Lewis
||--- Official judge = no
|||--- Judge = ESPN
||||--- class: Lewis
|||--- Judge != ESPN
||||--- Round <= 3
|||||--- class: Holyfield
|||||--- Round > 3
|||||--- class: Lewis

Here's my reasoning:

1. HBO-Lederman is a distinct judge, so I used it as the first split.
2. For non-HBO-Lederman judges, I checked if they were official judges. If yes, I split based on the round number (6) since early rounds might be more competitive.
3. Within the "Official judge = yes" branch, I classified Rounds 1-6 as Holyfield wins and Rounds 7-12 as Lewis wins, assuming a potential momentum shift in favor of Lewis mid-fight.
4. For non-official judges, I further split based on ESPN (another prominent media outlet). If it's ESPN, I classify the round as a Lewis win.
5. Within the "Judge != ESPN" branch, I used Round 3 as a split point, classifying Rounds 1-3 as Holyfield wins and Rounds 4-12 as Lewis wins.

Please note that this decision tree is highly speculative and might not accurately reflect real-world boxing results or judging decisions. The induced tree should be taken as an illustrative example rather than a reliable predictor.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of the decision tree or attempt to improve it with additional features?

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official judge
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Round <= 6
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 8  # ESPN
    nodes[4] = X["Round"] > 3  # Round > 3

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
    elif nodes[1]:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        elif nodes[4]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the feature values and returns a tuple containing the predicted outcome (either 0 for Holyfield or 1 for Lewis) and a list of boolean values representing the inner nodes. The list is converted to integers using `[int(node) for node in nodes]`, where `True` becomes 1 and `False` becomes 0.

Note that I've used the encoded values for the "Judge" feature, assuming that HBO-Lederman corresponds to value 3 and ESPN corresponds to value 8. If these encodings are incorrect, please adjust the code accordingly.
