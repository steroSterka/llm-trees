Based on the features you provided, I will build a decision tree to classify which of the two boxing fighters (Lewis and Holyfield) won each round. Here is the resulting tree:


|--- Judge in ("E. Williams", "L. O'Connell", "S. Christodoulu")
||--- Official judge: yes
|||--- class: Lewis
||--- Official judge: no
|||--- class: Holyfield
|--- Judge in ("HBO-Lederman", "Sportsticker", "Boxing Times", "Sportsline", "Associated Press", "ESPN", "Boxing Monthly-Leach")
||--- Round <= 6
|||--- class: Holyfield
||--- Round > 6
|||--- class: Lewis


Here's a brief explanation of the tree:

* The first split is based on the Judge feature, separating the judges into two groups. If the judge is one of E. Williams, L. O'Connell, or S. Christodoulu, we further check if they are an official judge.
	+ If they are an official judge, the class is Lewis.
	+ If not, the class is Holyfield.
* For the other group of judges (HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, Boxing Times, Sportsline, Associated Press, ESPN, and Boxing Monthly-Leach), we split based on the Round feature.
	+ If the round is 6 or earlier, the class is Holyfield.
	+ If the round is later than 6, the class is Lewis.

Please note that this decision tree is a simple example and may not accurately reflect real-world data. The performance of the model can be improved by using more advanced techniques, such as pruning, cross-validation, or feature engineering.

Here is the Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:


```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2]
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

In this function, we first initialize the `nodes` list with three elements. We then evaluate each condition and assign a boolean value to the corresponding element in the `nodes` list.

We use integer encoding to represent the truth values of the inner nodes, where 1 represents True and 0 represents False.

The prediction is made based on the decision tree logic, and we return both the prediction and the list of node values.
