Based on the features you provided, I will build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. 

First, let's identify the most important features for classifying which boxer won each round.

Feature Importance:

* Judge: High importance - different judges may have different opinions on who won the round.
* Round: Medium importance - certain rounds may be more decisive than others.
* Official judge: Low importance - while being an official judge may add credibility, it's unlikely to be a strong indicator of which boxer won.

Decision Tree:

|--- Judge == (E. Williams / S. Christodoulu / ESPN)
||--- Round <= 6
|||--- class: Lewis
||--- Round > 6
|||--- class: Holyfield
|--- Judge != (E. Williams / S. Christodoulu / ESPN)
||--- Official judge == yes
|||--- class: Lewis
||--- Official judge != yes
|||--- class: Holyfield

This decision tree suggests that:

* If the judge is E. Williams, S. Christodoulu, or ESPN, and it's an early round (1-6), Lewis is likely to have won.
* If the judge is E. Williams, S. Christodoulu, or ESPN, but it's a later round (7-12), Holyfield is likely to have won.
* For other judges, if they are official judges, Lewis is more likely to have won. Otherwise, Holyfield is more likely to have won.

Note that this decision tree is based on hypothetical data and actual results may vary depending on the specific dataset used for training.


#########################


Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [0, 8] or (X["Official"] == 1 and X["Round"] <= 6)
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] > 6
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        if X["Official"] == 1:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return int(prediction), [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

In this function, we first define the two inner nodes of the decision tree. The first node checks whether the judge is E. Williams or ESPN (or an official judge with a round number less than or equal to 6). The second node checks whether the round number is greater than 6.

We then use these nodes to make a prediction about which boxer won the round. If the first node is True, we check the second node and predict accordingly. If the first node is False, we check whether the judge is an official judge and predict accordingly.

Finally, we return both the predicted target value (0 for Holyfield, 1 for Lewis) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise).
