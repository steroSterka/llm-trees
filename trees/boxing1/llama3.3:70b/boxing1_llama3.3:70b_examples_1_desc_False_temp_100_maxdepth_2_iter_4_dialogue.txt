To build a decision tree classifier that determines which boxer won each round based on the features provided, we'll first need to establish some groundwork since the actual dataset for the boxing match between Lewis and Holyfield isn't provided here. We will simulate how one might approach this task given the constraints.

### Features:
1. **Judge**: The source of the judgment (e.g., E. Williams, L. O'Connell, etc.)
2. **Official Judge**: Whether the judge is official or not
3. **Round**: The round number in the match

### Simulated Decision Tree Construction:

Given that we don't have actual data to train a model, I'll illustrate how one might construct a decision tree based on these features for a hypothetical scenario.

1. **Root Node (Decision Based on Judge)**: Since different judges may have different biases or preferences, let's first split based on the judge.
   
   |--- Judge == E. Williams
   ||--- Further decisions...
   |--- Judge != E. Williams
   ||--- Further decisions...

2. **First Level Split for E. Williams**: Let's assume that E. Williams tends to favor Lewis more if the round is early.

   |--- Judge == E. Williams
   ||--- Round <= 6
   |||--- class: Lewis
   ||--- Round > 6
   |||--- Further decisions...

3. **First Level Split for Other Judges**: For simplicity, let's say other judges tend to favor Holyfield in later rounds but need to consider if they are official or not.

   |--- Judge != E. Williams
   ||--- Official Judge == yes
   |||--- Round > 6
   |||--- class: Holyfield
   ||--- Official Judge == no
   |||--- Further decisions...

4. **Further Decisions for Non-E. Williams and Unofficial Judges**: For non-official judges not named E. Williams, let's assume they might favor Lewis in earlier rounds due to his aggression.

   |--- Judge != E. Williams
   ||--- Official Judge == no
   |||--- Round <= 6
   |||--- class: Lewis
   |||--- Round > 6
   |||--- Further decisions...

Given the constraint of a maximum depth of 2 and without actual data, we simplify our decision tree to not delve deeper than two levels. The exact splits would depend on analyzing real data from past matches or specific tendencies observed in the judges' scoring patterns.

### Simplified Decision Tree:

- **For E. Williams**:
  - Round <= 6: Lewis
  - Round > 6: This could further split based on other factors like the fighter's performance, but given our constraints and lack of data, let's simplify to Holyfield for rounds greater than 6.

- **For Other Official Judges**:
  - Round > 6: Holyfield

- **For Non-Official Judges or Other Scenarios**:
  - Given the complexity and variability without specific data, we would generally lean towards Lewis in early rounds and Holyfield in later rounds based on hypothetical tendencies.

This approach is highly speculative and intended for illustrative purposes. Actual construction of a decision tree classifier would require detailed round-by-round scoring data from multiple matches involving both fighters, as well as the judges' past decisions to identify patterns or biases accurately.

Here's how you can format your decision tree as a Python function based on the provided features and target variable. The thresholds used in this example are hypothetical and may need to be adjusted based on actual data analysis.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict which boxer won a round based on the given features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the features 'Judge', 'Official', 'Round', 
              and optionally 'Target variable' or 'target'.
              
    Returns:
    prediction (int): The predicted winner of the round (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield).
    nodes (list): A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """
    
    # Initialize nodes list with None
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Judge is E. Williams (encoded as 0)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 0
    
    # Node 1: Round is greater than 6 (assuming later rounds favor Holyfield)
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] > 6
    
    # Prediction logic based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:  # E. Williams as judge
        prediction = 1  # Favor Lewis for simplicity in this example
    else:  # Other judges
        if nodes[1]:  # Later rounds
            prediction = 0  # Favor Holyfield in later rounds
        else:  # Earlier rounds
            prediction = 1  # Favor Lewis in earlier rounds
    
    # Convert boolean values in nodes to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X = {
    "Judge": 0,  # E. Williams
    "Official": 1,  # Official judge
    "Round": 5  # Round number
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Predicted winner: {'Lewis' if prediction == 1 else 'Holyfield'}")
print("Nodes:", nodes)

```

This function implements a simplified decision tree that predicts the winner of a boxing round based on the judge and the round number. The `nodes` list represents the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree, where `1` indicates that the condition was true, and `0` indicates that it was false.
