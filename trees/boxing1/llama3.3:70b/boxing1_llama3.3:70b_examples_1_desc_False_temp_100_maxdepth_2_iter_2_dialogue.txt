To induce a decision tree classifier for determining which boxer won each round based on the given features, we first need to understand that the task involves classification using the features: Judge, Official judge, and Round. The goal is to classify which of the two boxing fighters (Lewis or Holyfield) won each round.

Given the nature of your request, it seems there's a mix-up in the examples provided, as the initial example discusses flower species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on petal and sepal dimensions, which doesn't apply directly to boxing matches. For the boxing match classification, we'll focus on the features related to the judges and rounds.

To build an effective decision tree for classifying the winner of each round in a boxing match between Lewis and Holyfield, we need to consider how these features might influence the outcome:

1. **Judge**: Different judges may have different scoring tendencies or biases.
2. **Official Judge**: Whether the judge is official could impact the legitimacy or weighting of their score.
3. **Round**: The round number might indicate patterns in fighter performance over time.

Since we're aiming for a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 and given the unique nature of each feature, let's consider how these features could interact to predict the winner of each round:

- **Root Node (Depth 0)**: Judge
  - The reasoning here is that different judges might have significant variability in their scoring, potentially being more inclined towards one fighter over the other due to personal bias or judging style.

- **First Level (Depth 1)**:
  - **For a specific subset of judges** (e.g., E. Williams, HBO-Lederman), we might consider the Round as the next factor.
    - Early rounds might favor one fighter due to their strategy and stamina, while later rounds could see a shift if one fighter tires more quickly than the other.
  - **For another subset of judges**, Official Judge could be considered, especially if there's a belief that official judges are less biased or more consistent in their scoring.

- **Second Level (Depth 2)**:
  - If we went with Round at Depth 1 for certain judges, at this level, we might look at the interaction between Official Judge and Round.
    - For example, in later rounds (e.g., Rounds 10-12), an official judge might be more likely to score in favor of the fighter who is seen as finishing strong, regardless of early round performance.

Given these considerations, a simplified decision tree could look something like this:

```
|--- Judge: E. Williams / HBO-Lederman
||--- Round <= 6
|||--- class: Lewis (assuming Lewis starts strong)
||--- Round > 6
|||--- class: Holyfield (assuming Holyfield finishes strong)
|--- Judge: Official (e.g., L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu)
||--- Official Judge: yes
|||--- class: Lewis (if official judges favor Lewis due to technical performance)
||--- Official Judge: no
|||--- class: Holyfield (if non-official judges see Holyfield as more aggressive or fan-favorite)
```

This decision tree is highly speculative and simplified, as real-world boxing matches involve complex interactions between fighters' skills, strategies, and the subjective judgments of referees and judges. The actual performance and outcome can depend on a multitude of factors not captured by this simplified model, including but not limited to fighter health, strategy adjustments during the fight, and external factors like crowd influence.

In practice, building an accurate decision tree for predicting boxing match outcomes would require a much more detailed dataset that includes specific actions during fights (e.g., punches landed, defense effectiveness) and potentially more nuanced judge characteristics.

Here's a Python function that represents the decision tree for predicting which boxer won each round based on the given features. This function takes in a dictionary `X` containing the features and returns a tuple with the predicted winner (0 for Holyfield, 1 for Lewis) and a list of boolean values representing the conditions of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes with None
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Root node condition: Judge is E. Williams or HBO-Lederman (0 or 3)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [0, 3]
    
    # Second level condition based on Round for specific judges or Official status
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6  # For favored judges, Lewis might win early rounds
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1  # For other judges, consider official status
    
    # Prediction based on conditions
    if nodes[0]:  # Favored judges (E. Williams or HBO-Lederman)
        prediction = 1 if nodes[1] else 0  # Lewis wins early rounds, Holyfield late rounds
    else:  # Other judges
        prediction = 1 if nodes[1] else 0  # Official judges favor Lewis, non-official favor Holyfield
    
    # Convert boolean nodes to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
features = {
    "Judge": 0,  # E. Williams
    "Official": 1,  # Official judge
    "Round": 5,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # 1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This function implements a simple decision tree based on the provided features and target variable. The `predict` function takes in a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple with the predicted winner of the round (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) and a list representing the conditions of the inner nodes. Note that this is a highly simplified model and actual boxing match outcomes can depend on many more factors not considered here.
