To build a decision tree classifier for determining which boxer won each round based on the given features, we first need to understand that the features provided are not directly related to boxing or the outcome of rounds in a boxing match. However, for the sake of creating an example, let's proceed with what we have.

Given Features:
1. Judge (E. Williams / L. O'Connell / S. Christodoulu / HBO-Lederman / Sportsticker / Boxing Times / Sportsline / Associated Press / ESPN / Boxing Monthly-Leach)
2. Official judge (yes / no)
3. Round (1 to 12)

Since the features do not directly relate to performance metrics in boxing, we will have to make assumptions on how these could influence the outcome.

Decision Tree with a maximum depth of 2:
```
|--- Judge == HBO-Lederman
    |--- Official judge == yes
        |--- class: Lewis
    |--- Official judge == no
        |--- class: Holyfield
|--- Judge != HBO-Lederman
    |--- Round <= 6
        |--- class: Lewis
    |--- Round > 6
        |--- class: Holyfield
```

Explanation:
- The decision to use "Judge" as the top-level split is arbitrary since we don't have actual performance data. In real scenarios, features like punches landed, defense, and aggression would be more relevant.
- Using "HBO-Lederman" as a specific judge might imply that this particular judge has a bias or a unique scoring system that could favor one fighter over the other under certain conditions (official vs. non-official judging).
- For rounds where the judge is not HBO-Lederman, we split based on the round number, assuming that early rounds might favor one fighter due to their strategy and later rounds another due to endurance or adjustments made during the fight.

Please note, this decision tree is highly speculative and does not reflect real-world boxing match outcomes, as it's built upon features unrelated to actual performance metrics in a boxing match. In reality, determining which boxer won each round would depend on quantifiable data related to their performance (punches landed, defense effectiveness, aggression levels, etc.) rather than the identity of judges or whether they are official.

Here's how you could format your decision tree as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts which boxer won the round based on the given features.

    Args:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the features.
        - Judge (int): The judge of the round (0 = E. Williams, 1 = L. O'Connell, 2 = S. Christodoulu, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 4 = Sportsticker, 5 = Boxing Times, 6 = Sportsline, 7 = Associated Press, 8 = ESPN, 9 = Boxing Monthly-Leach)
        - Official (int): Whether the judge is official (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
        - Round (int): The round number (1 to 12)

    Returns:
    prediction (int): The predicted winner of the round (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield)
    nodes (list): A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes
    """

    # Initialize the nodes list with None values
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Check if the judge is HBO-Lederman
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3

    # Check if the round is less than or equal to 6
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6

    # Make a prediction based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        # If the judge is HBO-Lederman, check if they are official
        prediction = X["Official"]
    else:
        # If the judge is not HBO-Lederman, predict based on the round
        prediction = int(nodes[1] == False)

    # Convert boolean values to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes


# Example usage:
features = {
    "Judge": 3,
    "Official": 1,
    "Round": 7
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)

```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features as input and returns the predicted winner of the round along with the truth values of the inner nodes. The `nodes` list contains boolean values indicating whether each condition is satisfied, which are then converted to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0) before being returned.
