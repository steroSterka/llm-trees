To build a decision tree that classifies which of the two boxing fighters (Lewis and Holyfield) won each round based on the given features, we first need to understand the significance of these features in determining the outcome. However, without specific data or outcomes from previous fights, we'll have to approach this theoretically.

Given the features:
- Judge: This could be significant as different judges might have slightly different criteria for scoring rounds.
- Official judge (yes/no): This feature indicates whether the judge is an official scorer of the fight, which could affect their scoring due to potential biases or adherence to specific judging standards.
- Round (1 to 12): The round number can influence the outcome because fighters' strategies and conditions (e.g., fatigue) change over the course of a fight.

Since we're tasked with building a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, we'll focus on the most influential features. Let's assume "Judge" is a critical factor due to potential differences in judging styles, and "Round" could be significant as it might reflect changing dynamics or strategies during the fight.

Here's a theoretical decision tree:

1. **Root Node**: Judge
   - The reasoning behind choosing "Judge" as the root node is that different judges may have distinct tendencies in scoring rounds, potentially influenced by their experience, biases, or the specific instructions they've received.
   
2. **First Level Nodes**:
   - **Node 1 (Left Child of Root)**: Judge = E. Williams / L. O'Connell / S. Christodoulu
     - These judges might have a reputation for favoring technical skill over aggression, for example.
   - **Node 2 (Right Child of Root)**: Judge = HBO-Lederman / Sportsticker / Boxing Times / Sportsline / Associated Press / ESPN / Boxing Monthly-Leach
     - This group includes media and organizational scorers who might emphasize different aspects of the fight.

3. **Second Level Nodes** (Maximum Depth Reached):
   - Under each first-level node, we could further differentiate based on "Round" to account for how strategies or conditions change:
     - **Node 1.1 (Left Child of Node 1)**: Round <= 6
       - If the fight is in its early stages and judged by someone from Node 1's group, Lewis might be favored due to his potentially more aggressive start.
       - **Class**: Lewis
     - **Node 1.2 (Right Child of Node 1)**: Round > 6
       - In later rounds, with the same judges, Holyfield's endurance and late-round pushes might give him an edge.
       - **Class**: Holyfield
     - **Node 2.1 (Left Child of Node 2)**: Round <= 6
       - For this group of judges in early rounds, Holyfield's technical skill might be favored.
       - **Class**: Holyfield
     - **Node 2.2 (Right Child of Node 2)**: Round > 6
       - In later rounds with these judges, Lewis's power and potential for a late knockout could be decisive.
       - **Class**: Lewis

Decision Tree:
```
|--- Judge = E. Williams / L. O'Connell / S. Christodoulu
||--- Round <= 6: Class = Lewis
||--- Round > 6: Class = Holyfield
|--- Judge = HBO-Lederman / Sportsticker / Boxing Times / Sportsline / Associated Press / ESPN / Boxing Monthly-Leach
||--- Round <= 6: Class = Holyfield
||--- Round > 6: Class = Lewis
```

Please note, this decision tree is highly speculative and based on hypothetical assumptions about the scoring tendencies of different judges and how fight dynamics change over rounds. In reality, building an accurate decision tree would require historical data on fights judged by these individuals, including how they scored specific rounds in relation to observable characteristics of the fighters' performances.

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree based on the provided features and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts which of the two boxing fighters won each round.

    Args:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the features.
        - 'Judge': Judge (0 = E. Williams, 1 = L. O'Connell, 2 = S. Christodoulu, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 
                      4 = Sportsticker, 5 = Boxing Times, 6 = Sportsline, 7 = Associated Press, 
                      8 = ESPN, 9 = Boxing Monthly-Leach)
        - 'Official': Official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
        - 'Round': Round (1 to 12)

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """

    # Initialize the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Node 0: Judge is one of E. Williams, L. O'Connell, or S. Christodoulu
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2]
    
    # Node 1: Round is less than or equal to 6
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6

    # Make the prediction based on the inner nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Judge is one of E. Williams, L. O'Connell, or S. Christodoulu
        if nodes[1]:
            # And Round is less than or equal to 6, predict Lewis wins
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # Otherwise, predict Holyfield wins
            prediction = 0
    else:
        # If Judge is not one of E. Williams, L. O'Connell, or S. Christodoulu
        if nodes[1]:
            # And Round is less than or equal to 6, predict Holyfield wins
            prediction = 0
        else:
            # Otherwise, predict Lewis wins
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]

# Example usage
X = {
    "Judge": 0,
    "Official": 1,
    "Round": 5
}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Inner nodes: {nodes}")

```

In this code:

*   We define a function `predict` that takes a dictionary `X` containing the features as input.
*   The function initializes two inner nodes (`nodes[0]` and `nodes[1]`) based on the conditions specified in the decision tree.
*   It then makes a prediction by evaluating the inner nodes and returns the prediction along with the truth values of the inner nodes.
*   In the example usage, we create a dictionary `X` representing a sample input and call the `predict` function to get the prediction and inner node values.
