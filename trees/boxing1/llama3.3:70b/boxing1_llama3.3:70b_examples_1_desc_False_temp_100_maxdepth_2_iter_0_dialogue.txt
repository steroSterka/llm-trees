To induce a decision tree classifier for determining which boxer won each round based on the given features, we first need to understand that the provided features relate to the judges and the rounds rather than direct boxing performance metrics. Given this context, let's proceed with creating a hypothetical decision tree since actual data on how these features directly influence the outcome of a boxing match between Lewis and Holyfield isn't provided.

Here are the steps and a simplified decision tree based on the assumption that certain judges might have tendencies or biases towards particular fighters:

1. **Feature Selection**: The most important feature in this context would likely be "Judge" since different judges may score rounds differently due to their subjective evaluations of performance. "Round" could also be significant as the strategy and energy levels of fighters can change over the course of a fight.

2. **Decision Tree Construction**:
    - Given that we're building a tree with a maximum depth of 2, we'll consider two layers of decisions.
    - The first layer will split based on "Judge" to account for potential biases or tendencies in scoring.
    - The second layer could further refine this by considering the "Round" if necessary.

Here's a simplified example of what such a decision tree might look like:

- **Decision Tree**:
  |--- Judge == (E. Williams / L. O'Connell)
  ||--- Round <= 6
  |||--- class: Lewis
  ||--- Round > 6
  |||--- class: Holyfield
  |--- Judge == (S. Christodoulu / HBO-Lederman / Sportsticker)
  ||--- Round <= 9
  |||--- class: Holyfield
  ||--- Round > 9
  |||--- class: Lewis

This decision tree is highly speculative and based on the assumption that certain judges might favor one fighter over another in early rounds (due to, for example, a more aggressive start) and that the tide could turn as the fight progresses due to factors like endurance.

**Note**: Without actual data or insights into how these features correlate with fight outcomes, any decision tree constructed will be purely hypothetical. Real-world application would require detailed analysis of past fights, judges' scoring tendencies, and possibly even more nuanced metrics related to fighter performance within each round. 

In practice, you'd use a machine learning library (like scikit-learn in Python) to train a DecisionTreeClassifier on your dataset, specifying `max_depth=2` as a parameter. The classifier would then automatically select the most informative features and construct the tree based on your training data.

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree based on the provided features and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts which boxer won the round based on the judge and round.

    Args:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the features.
        - 'Judge': The judge scoring the round (0 = E. Williams, 1 = L. O'Connell, 2 = S. Christodoulu, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 4 = Sportsticker, 5 = Boxing Times, 6 = Sportsline, 7 = Associated Press, 8 = ESPN, 9 = Boxing Monthly-Leach)
        - 'Official': Whether the judge is an official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
        - 'Round': The round number (1 to 12)

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
        - Prediction: Which boxer won the round (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield)
        - Inner nodes: A list where each element represents whether the condition at that node was satisfied (1 if true, 0 if false)
    """
    # Initialize nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Node 0: Check if Judge is E. Williams or L. O'Connell
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1]
    
    # Node 1: Check if Round is less than or equal to 6
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    # Make prediction based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins early rounds for these judges
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins later rounds for these judges
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins early rounds for other judges
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins later rounds for other judges

    # Convert boolean values in nodes to integers (1 if True, 0 if False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes


# Example usage
X = {
    "Judge": 0,
    "Official": 1,
    "Round": 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Which boxer won the round (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield)
print(f"Inner nodes: {nodes}")  # Truth values for the inner nodes
```

This code defines a function `predict` that takes in a dictionary `X` with features and returns a prediction of which boxer won the round along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The decision tree is based on the judge and the round number, assuming certain judges might favor Lewis or Holyfield at different stages of the fight.
