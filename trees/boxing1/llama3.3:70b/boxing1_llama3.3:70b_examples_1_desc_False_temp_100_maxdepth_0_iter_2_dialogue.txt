To build a decision tree that classifies which of the two boxing fighters (Lewis and Holyfield) won each round based on the given features, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Feature Selection**: Determine the most relevant features from the given set that could influence the outcome of a round in a boxing match. The features provided are:
   - Judge: This indicates who scored the round.
   - Official judge (yes/no): Indicates if the scorer is an official judge or not.
   - Round (1 to 12): The round number.

2. **Decision Tree Construction**: We'll construct a decision tree based on these features. However, without specific data (e.g., scores from each judge for each round), we can only propose a hypothetical structure that could be refined with actual data.

Given the nature of the task and the lack of detailed scoring data, let's hypothesize how the decision tree might look if we were classifying rounds based on judges' decisions:

- **Root Node**: Start with "Judge" as it directly influences the outcome (Lewis wins or Holyfield wins).
  
  |--- Judge: E. Williams
  ||--- Round <= 6
  |||--- Official judge: yes
  ||||--- Class: Lewis (Assuming E. Williams tends to favor Lewis in early rounds)
  |||--- Official judge: no
  ||||--- Class: Holyfield (Non-official judges might have different opinions)
  ||--- Round > 6
  |||--- Class: Holyfield (Later rounds might see a shift in scoring, hypothetical)

- **Another Branch**:
  
  |--- Judge: L. O'Connell
  ||--- Official judge: yes
  |||--- Round <= 3
  ||||--- Class: Lewis (Early rounds, official judges might score differently)
  |||--- Round > 3
  ||||--- Class: Holyfield

- **And Another**:
  
  |--- Judge: HBO-Lederman / Sportsticker / Boxing Times / Sportsline / Associated Press / ESPN / Boxing Monthly-Leach
  ||--- This could further branch into specific judges and their tendencies, round numbers, or whether they are official.

This decision tree is highly speculative without actual data. The classification (Lewis wins or Holyfield wins) at each leaf node would depend on the scoring patterns of each judge across different rounds. In reality:

- **Data Collection**: Collect historical data on how each judge scores rounds in boxing matches, focusing on Lewis vs. Holyfield.
- **Feature Engineering**: If possible, incorporate more features like fighter performance metrics (e.g., punches landed, defense).
- **Decision Tree Learning Algorithm**: Use an algorithm (like ID3, C4.5, or CART) to construct the tree based on your dataset.

Remember, this example is simplified and intended for illustrative purposes. Real-world applications would require extensive data analysis and potentially more complex models, including ensemble methods or even neural networks, depending on the complexity of the task and the dataset's characteristics.

Based on the provided features and target variable, here is a Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts which boxer won the round based on the given features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing the features 'Judge', 'Official', 'Round', and the target variable is not used in prediction.
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the predicted outcome (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if Judge is E. Williams
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 0
    
    # Node 1: Check if Official judge is Yes
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Node 2: Check if Round is in the first half
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    # Node 3: Check if Judge is L. O'Connell or S. Christodoulu
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] in [1, 2]
    
    # Node 4: Check if Round is in the second half
    nodes[4] = X["Round"] > 6
    
    prediction = None
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins early rounds with E. Williams as judge
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins late rounds with E. Williams as judge
    elif nodes[3]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins with official judges L. O'Connell or S. Christodoulu
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins without official judges L. O'Connell or S. Christodoulu
    else:
        if nodes[4]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins late rounds with other judges
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins early rounds with other judges
    
    # Convert boolean values to integers for node truth values
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
X = {
    "Judge": 0,
    "Official": 1,
    "Round": 5
}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Node truth values:", nodes)
```

This decision tree is based on the assumption that E. Williams tends to favor Lewis in early rounds, and L. O'Connell or S. Christodoulu tend to favor Lewis when they are official judges. Other judges may have different tendencies, but for simplicity, we assume they favor Holyfield in late rounds and Lewis in early rounds. The actual performance of the decision tree will depend on the quality of the data used to train it.
