To build a decision tree classifier for determining which boxer won each round based on the features you provided, we first need to understand that the features given are quite different from those typically used in boxing analysis. For instance, "Judge" and "Offical judge (yes / no)" could be relevant as they directly relate to the scoring of rounds, but "Round (1 to 12)" is more about the timing or sequence of the fight rather than a characteristic that would influence the outcome of a round.

However, given these features are not directly indicative of boxing performance metrics such as punches landed, defense, etc., and assuming we're working within a hypothetical where these judges' scores are our primary data points for determining round winners, here's how one might approach building a decision tree:

1. **Data Preparation**: The first step involves preparing your data. This would typically include converting categorical variables into numerical ones if necessary (e.g., one-hot encoding for "Judge" and binary encoding for "Offical judge").

2. **Feature Selection**: Since we don't have direct metrics of performance, we rely on the assumption that certain judges might lean towards one fighter over another based on their scoring history or style preferences. The feature "Round" could potentially influence decisions if there's a pattern in how fights are scored over time (e.g., more aggressive fighters being favored in early rounds).

3. **Decision Tree Construction**: 
    - **Root Node**: Start with the most informative feature, which might be "Judge" given its direct impact on scoring decisions.
    - **Splitting Criteria**: For each node, determine the best split based on minimizing impurity (e.g., Gini index or entropy). For categorical features like "Judge", this could involve creating child nodes for each judge and evaluating which judge's scores most consistently favor one fighter over another.

Here's a hypothetical decision tree structure:

- **Root Node**: Judge
    - If Judge is E. Williams, L. O'Connell, or HBO-Lederman:
        - These judges might historically favor aggressive fighters; thus, if Official Judge = yes and Round <= 6, classify as Lewis won.
        - Otherwise, classify as Holyfield won.
    - If Judge is S. Christodoulu, Sportsticker, Boxing Times, Sportsline, Associated Press, ESPN, or Boxing Monthly-Leach:
        - These judges might favor technical fighters; thus, if Official Judge = yes and Round > 6, classify as Holyfield won.
        - Otherwise, classify as Lewis won.

**Note**: This decision tree is highly speculative and based on arbitrary assumptions about the preferences of different judges. In reality, determining which boxer wins a round involves analyzing fight metrics such as punches thrown, landed, defense, knockdowns, etc., rather than just relying on who's judging and when.

Given the lack of direct relevance between the provided features and the outcome of boxing rounds, this exercise is more about illustrating how one might approach building a decision tree with any given set of features rather than providing a practical solution for predicting round winners in boxing.

Here's the Python function based on the decision tree for predicting which boxer won each round:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts which boxer won a round based on the given features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the features.
        - 'Judge': The judge scoring the round (0 = E. Williams, 1 = L. O'Connell, 2 = S. Christodoulu, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 
                  4 = Sportsticker, 5 = Boxing Times, 6 = Sportsline, 7 = Associated Press, 8 = ESPN, 9 = Boxing Monthly-Leach)
        - 'Official': Whether the judge is an official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
        - 'Round': The round number (1 to 12)

    Returns:
    prediction (int): The predicted winner of the round (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield)
    nodes (list): A list of boolean values representing the conditions of the inner nodes
    """
    
    # Initialize the nodes list with None
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if Judge is E. Williams, L. O'Connell, or HBO-Lederman
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 3]
    
    # Node 1: Check if Official judge is yes and Round <= 6
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1 and X["Round"] <= 6
    
    # Node 2: Check if Judge is S. Christodoulu, Sportsticker, Boxing Times, Sportsline, Associated Press, ESPN, or Boxing Monthly-Leach
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] in [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    
    # Node 3: Check if Official judge is yes and Round > 6
    nodes[3] = X["Official"] == 1 and X["Round"] > 6
    
    # Make predictions based on the node conditions
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1 if nodes[1] else 0
    elif nodes[2]:
        prediction = 0 if nodes[3] else 1
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Default to Lewis winning if none of the above conditions are met
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]

# Example usage:
X = {
    "Judge": 0,
    "Official": 1,
    "Round": 5
}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features as input and returns a tuple with the predicted winner of the round and a list representing the conditions of the inner nodes. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with sample data.
