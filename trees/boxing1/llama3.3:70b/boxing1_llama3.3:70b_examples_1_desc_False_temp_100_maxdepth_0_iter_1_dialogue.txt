Based on the features you provided, I will attempt to build a decision tree classifier. Since there are multiple judges and their opinions might vary, I'll consider the "Judge" feature as a categorical variable.

Here's a possible decision tree:

|--- Judge == HBO-Lederman / ESPN
||--- Round <= 6
|||--- class: Lewis
||--- Round > 6
|||--- class: Holyfield
|--- Judge != HBO-Lederman / ESPN
||--- Official judge == yes
|||--- Round <= 3
||||--- class: Lewis
||||--- Round > 3
|||||--- class: Holyfield
||--- Official judge == no
|||--- Round <= 9
||||--- class: Lewis
||||--- Round > 9
|||||--- class: Holyfield

However, this decision tree might not be the most accurate or optimal one. The features you provided don't seem to have a clear correlation with the outcome of each round. The judge's opinion and whether they are an official judge might influence their scoring, but it's hard to determine a clear pattern.

To improve the accuracy of the decision tree, more relevant features would be needed, such as:

* Punch statistics (e.g., number of punches thrown, landed, and missed)
* Fighter performance metrics (e.g., speed, agility, endurance)
* Round-by-round scoring by each judge
* Historical data on the fighters' past performances

With these additional features, a more accurate decision tree could be built to classify which fighter won each round.

Based on the features you provided, I will create a Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The decision tree is based on the assumption that certain judges and rounds are more likely to favor one fighter over the other.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes with None
    nodes = 4 * [None]

    # Node 0: Check if Judge is HBO-Lederman or ESPN (3 or 8)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [3, 8]

    # Node 1: Check if Round is less than or equal to 6
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6

    # Node 2: Check if Official judge is Yes (1)
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1

    # Node 3: Check if Round is less than or equal to 9
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 9

    prediction = None

    # Decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Judge is HBO-Lederman or ESPN, predict Lewis if Round is less than or equal to 6
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:
        # If Official judge is Yes and Round is less than or equal to 3, predict Lewis
        if nodes[2] and X["Round"] <= 3:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        elif nodes[2] and X["Round"] > 3:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        # If Official judge is No or Round is greater than 9, predict Holyfield
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield

    # Convert boolean values to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, which contains the features "Judge", "Official", and "Round". It returns a tuple containing the predicted outcome (`prediction`) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes (`nodes`). The decision tree is based on the assumption that certain judges and rounds are more likely to favor one fighter over the other. Note that this is just one possible implementation, and you may need to adjust the decision tree based on your specific requirements.
