<think>

Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants a decision tree to classify which fighter, Lewis or Holyfield, won each round based on the given features. The features provided are the judge's name, whether the judge is official, and the round number. Hmm, first, I need to recall how decision trees work. They split the data based on features that best separate the classes. Since the example they gave was about iris species, which is a classification problem, I can approach this similarly.

First, the features here are different from the iris dataset. The judges are categorical variables, the official judge is a binary feature, and the round is numeric. The target variable is which fighter won the round (Lewis or Holyfield).

I need to figure out which features are most important. Since the example used petal width first, maybe here the most important feature is something like the judge or the round. But how do I determine that without data?

Wait, perhaps the user expects me to make an educated guess based on typical boxing scoring. Maybe official judges are more accurate? Or perhaps certain judges favor one fighter over another. Also, rounds might matter because fighters might start stronger or tire out.

Let me think step by step. First, the root node. What splits the data best? Let's consider each feature's potential to separate the classes.

Starting with the judge: there are several judges listed. Maybe some judges consistently score Lewis higher, others Holyfield. For instance, if one judge always gives Lewis more points, then splitting on that judge would be useful. But without data, I need to assume which judge might be more predictive. Alternatively, maybe "Official judge" is a key feature because official judges' scores are the ones that count, so if it's an official judge, their decision is more likely to reflect the round winner. But maybe even non-official judges have patterns.

Alternatively, the round number might matter. Early rounds (like 1-4) might favor a certain style, while later rounds (like 10-12) favor another. So splitting on round could be important.

Since the example used a numerical feature first, maybe we start with a numeric feature here. Round is numeric (1-12). Let's suppose that in the middle rounds, say around 6, the fighters might be in their prime, so maybe split there. Or perhaps later rounds are more critical. Alternatively, maybe the round doesn't matter as much as the judge.

Alternatively, the official judge feature is binary, so it can split into two branches. If we split on "Official judge = yes", then we can separate the official from the non-official judges. Maybe official judges have more consistent scoring. So if the judge is official, their decision is more reliable, so perhaps that's a good split.

Alternatively, maybe the judge's name is the most important. For example, if E. Williams tends to favor Lewis, then splitting on that judge's entries would be useful. But since there are multiple judges, maybe the first split is on the judge's name. But with so many judges, that might lead to many branches. Alternatively, perhaps grouping judges by their biases.

Wait, but without actual data, I need to make assumptions. Let me try to structure it step by step.

Let me think of possible splits:

1. Start with the official judge. If it's an official judge, then their decision is more likely correct. So maybe split on official judge first. Suppose that if it's an official judge, then we can go deeper, but if not, maybe they might have their own biases.

Wait, but the target is which fighter won the round. So maybe official judges are more reliable, so their votes are more accurate, so splitting on official judge might be a good first step.

Let me try that:

Root node: Official judge = yes/no.

If yes (official), then perhaps look at the judge's name or round. Suppose official judges are more likely to have their own patterns. Let's say among official judges, maybe certain judges (like HBO-Lederman?) have a bias. Alternatively, maybe the round number matters more for official judges.

Alternatively, if official is yes, maybe split on round. For example, rounds after 8 might be more aggressive, so maybe Lewis, a heavier fighter, might win those, but Holyfield, maybe in earlier rounds. That's a common boxing narrative.

Alternatively, maybe the round splits into early, middle, late. Let's say split at round 6 or 8.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on the judge's name. Suppose that the judge "ESPN" always gives Holyfield the round, so if the judge is ESPN, then Holyfield wins. But that's a big assumption.

Alternatively, since there are multiple judges, maybe the first split is on the judge's name, but that could lead to too many branches. Maybe the most important judge is the official ones.

Alternatively, perhaps the most important feature is the round. Let's say in the later rounds (like >8), Lewis might dominate. So split on round >8.

Wait, this is getting a bit too speculative. Let me try to structure it as per the example given. The example for iris used petal width first, splitting at 0.8, then another split. So maybe here, the first split is on a feature that can split the data into two groups with clear majority.

Suppose that the official judge's decision is more trustworthy, so first split on official judge = yes.

If official judge is yes, then perhaps the next split is on the round. For example, rounds above 8, Lewis wins, else Holyfield.

Alternatively, maybe among official judges, certain judges favor one fighter. For instance, HBO-Lederman might be an official judge and favor Lewis.

But without data, I have to make assumptions.

Alternatively, perhaps the most important feature is the round. Let me think: in boxing, rounds can have patterns. Maybe in the first few rounds, Holyfield is more active, then Lewis takes over. So split the rounds into early/mid/late.

Alternatively, maybe the judge's name is the key. For example, "Associated Press" is a major outlet, so their judge might be more neutral, but maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on the judge's name being "Official" (but official is a separate feature). Wait, the features are separate: "Judge" is the name, and "Official judge" is a yes/no.

Hmm. Maybe the first split is on "Official judge = yes". Then, within official judges, split on round. For example, if official and round > 8, then Lewis wins. If official and round <=8, maybe split again on judge name.

Alternatively, the first split could be on the judge's name, but that would be too many branches. Let me try to think of a plausible tree.

Suppose the first split is on the round. Let's say if the round is greater than 8, then Lewis is more likely to win. So:

Root: Round > 8

If yes: Lewis wins.

If no: Then split on official judge.

Wait, but maybe that's not right. Alternatively:

Root: Official judge = yes.

If yes, then split on round.

Suppose among official judges, if round > 8, Lewis wins, else maybe split again on judge name.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the judge name. Let's pick a key judge. For example, if the judge is ESPN, then Holyfield wins. But I don't know.

Alternatively, since the example used a numerical feature first, maybe the round is the first split. Let's say Round > 8. If yes, then Lewis wins (assuming he's stronger in later rounds). If no, then split on official judge.

Wait, but maybe in earlier rounds, the official judges might have their own criteria. Hmm.

Alternatively, let's structure it as:

First split: Round > 8.5 (assuming rounds are 1-12, so split at 8.5 between 8 and 9)

If yes (round 9-12): Lewis wins.

If no (round 1-8), then next split on official judge.

If official yes: then split on judge name. For example, if the judge is HBO-Lederman, then Lewis wins; else, maybe Holyfield.

Alternatively, if official yes, maybe split on another feature.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to simplify. Let's try to mimic the example's structure. The example's tree was:

Petal width <= 0.8 → setosa

Else, split again on petal width <=1.75 → versicolor, else virginica.

So perhaps here, the first split is on a feature that can split the data into two groups, and then further splits.

Let me try:

First, the official judge feature. Let's split on official judge = yes.

If yes, then split on round.

Suppose the next split: Round > 8. So if official and round >8, then Lewis wins.

If official and round <=8, then maybe split on judge name.

Alternatively, maybe among official judges, certain judges are more likely to vote for one fighter.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on judge name. Let's pick the most predictive judge. Suppose that if the judge is "ESPN", then Holyfield wins.

But without data, this is guesswork. Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on the round being in the later stages.

Alternatively, maybe the most important feature is the judge being official. Let's go with that as the first split.

Decision tree:

Root: Official judge = yes.

If yes (official), then next split on Round >8.

- If yes (round 9-12), Lewis wins.

- If no (round 1-8), split on judge's name (maybe specific judge).

Wait, but that's getting too nested. Alternatively, after official and round <=8, maybe split on another feature.

Alternatively, after official and round <=8, maybe Holyfield wins. So:

Official judge yes:

- Round >8 → Lewis

- Round <=8 → Holyfield

Then, for non-official judges (official no):

- Maybe split on judge name. For example, if the judge is ESPN, then Holyfield, else Lewis. But again, arbitrary.

Alternatively, non-official judges might have varied scores, so maybe split on round again?

Alternatively, non-official judges might have different patterns. For example, in round 1, maybe Holyfield is active.

This is tricky without data. Let me try to make a plausible tree.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on the judge's name being "Official" but since that's a separate feature, maybe start with official.

Let me try to structure the decision tree with the given features. The features are:

Judge (E. Williams / L. O'Connell / S. Christodoulu / HBO-Lederman / Sportsticker / Boxing Times / Sportsline / Associated Press / ESPN / Boxing Monthly-Leach),

Official judge (yes/no),

Round (1-12)

I think the most straightforward approach is to start with the official judge as the first split. Then, for official judges, use round to decide. For non-official, perhaps use judge name or another feature.

Here's a possible structure:

Root: Official judge = yes?

- If yes (official):

   - Split on Round > 8.5 (so rounds 9-12)

      - If yes → Lewis (assuming later rounds favor Lewis)

      - If no → Split again on round <=6?

         - Round <=6 → Holyfield

         - Round 7-8 → Maybe split on another feature, but let's say Holyfield as well.

   - So for official judges, rounds 1-8: Holyfield, rounds 9-12: Lewis.

- If no (non-official):

   - Maybe split on judge's name. For example, if the judge is ESPN, then Holyfield. Else, maybe Lewis?

   - Alternatively, non-official judges might have different tendencies. Suppose that among non-official judges, the judge's name "ESPN" tends to favor Holyfield, others lean Lewis.

   - So:

      - Judge = ESPN → Holyfield

      - Else → Lewis

Alternatively, maybe non-official judges have more variation, so split on round again.

Alternatively, non-official judges might have different patterns. Suppose that in non-official rounds, the round number doesn't matter as much, but certain judges do.

Alternatively, perhaps non-official judges are more likely to favor Holyfield in early rounds and Lewis later, but that's similar to official.

This is speculative. Let me try to form a tree with these assumptions:

Decision Tree:

|--- Official judge = yes?

|   |--- Round > 8.5?

|   |   |--- class: Lewis (if round 9-12)

|   |--- Round <=8.5?

|   |   |--- class: Holyfield (if rounds 1-8)

|--- Official judge = no?

|   |--- Judge = ESPN?

|   |   |--- class: Holyfield

|   |--- Judge != ESPN?

|   |   |--- class: Lewis

Alternatively, maybe non-official judges other than ESPN lean towards Lewis.

Alternatively, maybe non-official judges have their own criteria. But this might be too simplistic.

Alternatively, for non-official judges, split on Round again. Suppose non-officials are more likely to favor Holyfield in early rounds, but since they're non-official, maybe their trends are different. But this requires more assumptions.

Alternatively, another approach: Maybe the most important feature is the judge's name. For example, if the judge is "HBO-Lederman", an official judge, and round is late, then Lewis. But I need to structure this.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the round being in the later part, then official status.

But to mirror the example given, which was a numerical feature first, perhaps start with Round.

Suppose first split is Round >8.

If yes (rounds 9-12), then Lewis.

If no (1-8), then split on official judge.

Official yes:

   Then split on judge name? Not sure. Maybe among official judges in rounds 1-8, Holyfield wins.

Official no (non-official in rounds 1-8):

   Then maybe split on judge name again. Like if ESPN, Holyfield else Lewis.

Hmm, but this is getting too deep.

Alternatively, the tree could be:

Root: Round >8 → Lewis

Else,

   Split on official judge.

   If official yes → Holyfield

   If official no → then split on judge's name (e.g., if ESPN then Holyfield else Lewis)

But this is a possible structure.

Alternatively, let me consider that official judges are more likely to have their own patterns. Maybe in rounds 1-8, official judges give Holyfield, while non-official might vary.

Alternatively, I think the key is to pick features that can split the data effectively. Since the example used a numerical feature first, perhaps Round is the first split.

Trying again:

Decision Tree:

|--- Round > 8.5?

|   |--- class: Lewis (rounds 9-12)

|--- Round <= 8.5?

|   |--- Official judge = yes?

|   |   |--- class: Holyfield (official judges in early rounds favor Holyfield)

|   |--- Official judge = no?

|   |   |--- Judge = ESPN?

|   |   |   |--- class: Holyfield

|   |   |--- Judge != ESPN?

|   |   |   |--- class: Lewis

This way, the tree first splits on round, then among early rounds, splits on official status, and then further splits on judge name for non-official.

Alternatively, maybe among non-official judges in early rounds, another feature like the judge's name can split further.

This might be a plausible structure, albeit based on assumptions. It uses the round first, then official status, then judge name for non-officials.

Alternatively, if non-official judges in rounds 1-8, maybe their decision depends on the judge. For instance, ESPN tends to favor Holyfield, while others might have different preferences, but without data, assuming that ESPN is a key splitter.

Alternatively, maybe non-official judges not named ESPN just default to Lewis, but that's arbitrary.

Alternatively, the final split could be on another judge, but with so many judges, it's hard. Maybe ESPN is the most prominent non-official?

Alternatively, perhaps the non-official judges in early rounds are split based on another feature, but since Round is already used, maybe the judge's name is the next.

Alternatively, perhaps the tree is simpler:

Root: Official judge = yes?

- If yes, then split on Round >8 → Lewis else Holyfield.

- If no, split on Judge = ESPN → Holyfield, else Lewis.

This way, the tree is manageable and uses the main features.

Alternatively, the user might expect the official judge to be a key splitter first, then rounds.

Let me try to write it concisely as per the example's style:

Decision Tree:

|--- Official judge = yes?

|   |--- Round > 8.5?

|   |   |--- class: Lewis

|   |--- Round <=8.5?

|   |   |--- class: Holyfield

|--- Official judge = no?

|   |--- Judge = ESPN?

|   |   |--- class: Holyfield

|   |--- Judge != ESPN?

|   |   |--- class: Lewis

Alternatively, maybe non-official judges have other criteria. But given the features, that's a possible structure. It uses the official judge first, then round for official, and judge name for non-official.

Alternatively, if non-official judges have another split, like Round again, but that might not be necessary.

Alternatively, for non-official judges, maybe their decision is more varied, so splitting on another judge's name isn't feasible without more data, so default to a class.

Alternatively, perhaps non-official judges in rounds 1-8 are split on Round again? Like Round <5, then Holyfield, else Lewis, but that's adding more splits.

Given the example's structure, maybe keep it to two levels after the first split.

Alternatively, here's another version:

|--- Round >8 → Lewis

|--- Round <=8?

|   |--- Official judge = yes → Holyfield

|   |--- Official judge = no → Lewis

But this might be too simplistic, assuming non-official judges in early rounds vote for Lewis, which might not be accurate.

Alternatively, maybe non-official in early rounds prefer Holyfield, but that's another assumption.

Alternatively, the most logical path is that official judges have a clear pattern based on round, and non-official have a different pattern based on their identity.

I think the first structure I proposed is reasonable. Let me present that as the answer.
</think>

**Decision Tree:**

```
|--- **Official judge = yes?**
|   |--- **Round > 8.5?**
|   |   |--- **class: Lewis** (Rounds 9–12)
|   |--- **Round ≤ 8.5?**
|   |   |--- **class: Holyfield** (Rounds 1–8)
|--- **Official judge = no?**
|   |--- **Judge = ESPN?**
|   |   |--- **class: Holyfield**
|   |--- **Judge ≠ ESPN?**
|   |   |--- **class: Lewis**
```

### Explanation:
1. **First Split (Official Judge?):**  
   - **Yes (Official):**  
     - **Second Split (Round >8.5?):**  
       - **Yes (Rounds 9–12):** Lewis (assumed to perform better in later rounds).  
       - **No (Rounds 1–8):** Holyfield (assumed to dominate early rounds).  
   - **No (Non-Official):**  
     - **Third Split (Judge = ESPN?):**  
       - **Yes (ESPN):** Holyfield (ESPN, a non-official judge, may favor Holyfield).  
       - **No (Other Non-Official Judges):** Lewis (default assumption for non-official judges not named ESPN).  

This structure uses **Round** and **Official Judge** as primary splits, with **Judge Name** (ESPN) acting as a secondary split for non-official judges. It balances simplicity with plausible assumptions about scoring tendencies.


#########################


<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to create a Python function that acts as a decision tree based on the given features and target variable. The features are Judge, Official, Round, and the target is which fighter won the round (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield). 

First, I need to understand the structure of the decision tree they mentioned. The example provided uses a decision tree with nodes and conditions, so I need to create a similar structure but tailored to the boxing scenario. Since the user didn't provide the actual decision tree structure, I have to make some assumptions here. Wait, actually, looking back, the user mentioned "format this decision tree as a Python function", but the initial message might have had a decision tree structure that's missing here. Hmm, maybe in the problem description, the user expects me to create a plausible decision tree based on the features given?

Wait, the user's first paragraph says "format this decision tree as a Python function...", but the actual tree isn't provided here. The example given is for a diabetes prediction, which uses features like petal_length, etc. But in the problem, the features are different. Since the user's input doesn't include the actual decision tree structure, maybe there was a mistake? Wait, perhaps I need to look again. Let me check the problem again.

Looking back, the user provided the features and their encodings but didn't specify the decision tree structure. Oh, right, maybe this is part of a previous problem that the user is now following up on? Since the initial instruction says "Here are the exact keys...", and the example shows a function structure, perhaps the user expects me to create a decision tree based on common sense or some logical conditions using the given features. 

Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to assume a simple decision tree structure. Let me think. The features are Judge (categorical), Official (binary), Round (1-12), and the target is who won the round. 

Possible decision points could be:

1. Check if the Official judge is 1 (since official judges might have more influence?), so maybe if it's an official judge, the decision leans towards a certain fighter.

2. The round number: maybe in later rounds, the decision changes. For example, if the round is above 8, the outcome might differ.

3. The Judge's identity: certain judges might favor a fighter. For instance, if the judge is E. Williams (0), maybe they have a bias.

But without knowing the actual splits, this is speculative. Since the user wants placeholders filled with meaningful values, I need to make educated guesses.

Let me try to outline a possible decision tree structure.

Suppose the first split is based on the Official feature. If it's an official judge (Official=1), then check the Round. Maybe if the Round is >8, then Lewis (1) wins. Otherwise, check the judge.

Alternatively, here's a possible structure:

- First node: If Official is 1 (Yes), then proceed to check the Round.

- If Round is greater than 8: predict Lewis (1).

- Else, check the Judge. If the judge is E. Williams (0), maybe predict Holyfield (0).

But I need to structure this as a decision tree with nodes and conditions. Let me try to create a plausible tree structure step by step.

Let's imagine the decision tree has the following structure (this is made up but plausible):

1. Root node: If Official is 1 (Yes) → then check Round.

   - If Round > 8 → predict 1 (Lewis).

   - Else → check Judge.

       - If Judge is E. Williams (0) → predict 0 (Holyfield).

       - Else → predict 1 (Lewis).

But this is too simplistic. Maybe more layers.

Alternatively, another approach:

The first split could be on the Judge's identity. Let's say if the Judge is S. Christodoulu (Judge=2), then perhaps a certain outcome.

Alternatively, considering the features, here's a possible path:

Suppose the decision tree is structured as:

- Node 0: If Official is 1 → then check Round.

   - Node 1: If Round > 8 → predict 1 (Lewis).

   - Else → Node 2: Check Judge.

      - Node 3: If Judge is 0 (E. Williams) → predict 0.

      - Else → predict 1.

But this might be too simplistic. To make it more complex, perhaps split on Round first:

Wait, the example in the problem uses a function with multiple nodes (5 nodes in the example). The user's function example had 5 nodes. The problem's required function should have a list of nodes (maybe similar length). Let me think of a 5-node structure.

Let me think of a possible 5-node decision tree:

Nodes:

0: Check if Official is 1 (Yes).

1: If Official is 1, then check Round > 8.

2: If Round is not >8, check the Judge's value (maybe Judge is 0 or 1).

3: Another condition, perhaps Round < 5?

Alternatively, here's a structure:

Node 0: Official == 1

If yes (1), then Node 1: Round > 8 → if yes, predict 1.

Else (Round <=8), go to Node 2.

Node 2: Judge == 0 → predict 0.

Else, go to Node 3.

Wait, maybe this is getting too tangled. Let me try to make a plausible tree with 5 nodes. Since the example had 5 nodes, perhaps the answer should have 5 nodes as well.

Let me try:

Node 0: If Official is 1 → then proceed to check Round.

Node 1: If Round > 8 → predict 1 (Lewis). 

Else, check Judge.

Node 2: If Judge is 0 (E. Williams) → predict 0.

Else, check Round again.

Wait, maybe:

Structure:

Root is Node 0: Official ==1 (Yes).

If True:

   Node1: Round >8 → predict 1 (Lewis).

Else (Round <=8):

   Node2: Check if Judge is 0 (E. Williams). If yes → predict 0.

   Else:

      Node3: Check Round <5 → if yes, predict 0 (Holyfield).

      Else (Round 5-8):

         Node4: Check Judge's value, say Judge=1 (L. O'Connell) → predict 1.

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps:

The nodes could be:

nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1 

nodes[1] = X['Round'] > 8 

nodes[2] = X['Judge'] == 0 

nodes[3] = X['Round'] <= 5 

nodes[4] = X['Judge'] == 1 

Then the logic could be:

if nodes[0] (Official is yes):

   if nodes[1] (Round>8 → predict 1):

      prediction =1 

   else:

      if nodes[2] (Judge is 0 → predict 0):

         prediction =0 

      else:

         if nodes[3] (Round ≤5 → predict 0):

             prediction =0 

         else:

             if nodes[4] (Judge is 1 → predict 1):

                 prediction =1 

             else:

                 prediction =0 

Wait this is getting complicated, but perhaps that's the way to go. Let me structure it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps the decision tree is as follows:

The first split is on whether the judge is official. If official:

   Then check round. If round > 8 → Lewis (1). 

   Else, check if the judge is E. Williams (0). If yes → Holyfield (0). 

   Else → check if round is less than 5 → Holyfield (0).

   Else → check if judge is L. O'Connell (1) → then 1 (Lewis).

But I'm not sure. Since this is made up, I have to choose some plausible thresholds.

Alternatively, here's a structure with 5 nodes:

The nodes list will have 5 entries, each corresponding to a condition.

Let me try to write the code structure:

def predict(X: dict):

    nodes = 5 * [False]

    # Node 0: Check if Official is 1 (Yes)
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1 

    # Node 1: If Round > 8
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] > 8 

    # Node 2: If Judge is 0 (E. Williams)
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] == 0 

    # Node 3: If Round <5 
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <5 

    # Node4: If Judge is 1 (L. O'Connell)
    nodes[4] = X["Judge"] == 1 

    # Now the logic:

    if nodes[0]:  # Official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # Round >8 → Lewis (1)
            prediction =1
        else:  # Round <=8
            if nodes[2]:  # Judge is E. Williams → Holyfield (0)
                prediction =0
            else:
                if nodes[3]:  # Round <5 → maybe Holyfield
                    prediction =0
                else:  # Round between 5-8
                    if nodes[4]:  # Judge is L. O'Connell → predict 1
                        prediction =1
                    else:  # other judges → maybe 0?
                        prediction =0
    else:  # Not official judge
        # Maybe default to another condition, like round?
        # Suppose if Round is even → 1, else 0? Not sure.
        # Alternatively, maybe default to 0 (Holyfield)
        prediction =0 

    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but this might not cover all paths. Let me check the logic flow again.

Wait, when nodes[0] is true (Official), and nodes[1] is false (Round <=8):

Then check node2 (Judge is 0). If true → 0.

Else (Judge not 0), then check node3 (Round <5). 

If yes → 0.

Else, since Round is between 5-8, check node4 (Judge is 1). If yes →1, else 0.

Hmm, that's possible.

If the user's example had 5 nodes, this uses all 5 nodes. Let me see if this structure can be coded properly.

Alternatively, perhaps the nodes are structured differently. Let's see if the conditions can be arranged to use all 5 nodes. 

Wait in my code above, in the case where nodes[0] is true, and nodes[1] is false, then nodes[2], nodes[3], nodes[4] are used. So all 5 nodes are referenced except node4 may not be used in all paths? Hmm, but the nodes list is filled with the conditions regardless of the path. So the nodes list will have all 5 entries with 1 or 0 based on each condition.

This should work. Let me think of test cases to see if this makes sense.

Example 1: Suppose Official=1, Round=9 → nodes[0] is true, nodes[1] is true → prediction 1. The nodes list would have [1,1, ...], and the prediction is 1. That's okay.

Example 2: Official=1, Round=4, Judge=0 → nodes0=1, nodes1=0, nodes2=1 → prediction 0. That follows.

Another example: Official=1, Round=6, Judge=1 → nodes0=1, nodes1=0, nodes2=0 (since judge is 1), then nodes3: 6 <5? No → so node3 is 0. So we proceed to node4 (Judge is 1 → yes, so node4=1 → prediction 1.

Another case: Official=1, Round=5, Judge=2 → nodes0=1, nodes1=0 (since 5 <=8), nodes2=0, nodes3=0 (5 is not <5), then check node4 (Judge=2 → node4=0 → so prediction 0.

Hmm, that seems consistent.

What about if Official is 0 (not official):

Then the else clause sets prediction to 0. Maybe that's the case. So non-official judges default to Holyfield.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-official path should have its own conditions, but since the user's example had a simple else clause, maybe it's okay.

Alternatively, maybe there's more to it. But since the user didn't specify, perhaps this is a reasonable approach.

Now, coding that into the function.

Wait, in the code I wrote above, in the else case (non-official), the prediction is set to 0. That's okay.

Now, the nodes are set as:

nodes[0] = X["Official"] ==1 → 1 or 0.

nodes[1] = Round>8 → 1 or 0.

nodes[2] = Judge ==0 → 1 or 0.

nodes[3] = Round <5 → 1 or 0.

nodes[4] = Judge ==1 →1 or 0.

The prediction logic is as per the structure.

Now, coding this:

Wait, but in the code structure, I need to make sure all nodes are correctly assigned. Let me write the code properly.

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [False]
    nodes[0] = (X["Official"] == 1)
    nodes[1] = (X["Round"] > 8)
    nodes[2] = (X["Judge"] == 0)
    nodes[3] = (X["Round"] < 5)
    nodes[4] = (X["Judge"] == 1)

    prediction = 0  # default

    if nodes[0]:  # Official is Yes
        if nodes[1]:  # Round >8 → Lewis (1)
            prediction = 1
        else:  # Round <=8
            if nodes[2]:  # Judge is 0 → Holyfield (0)
                prediction = 0
            else:
                if nodes[3]:  # Round <5 → predict 0 (Holyfield)
                    prediction = 0
                else:  # Round between 5-8
                    if nodes[4]:  # Judge is 1 → predict 1 (Lewis)
                        prediction = 1
                    else:  # other judges → maybe 0?
                        prediction = 0
    else:  # Not official → default to 0
        prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but this might have some redundancy. Let me test another case:

If official is True, Round=6, Judge=2 (Judge=2 is not 0 or 1):

Then nodes0=1, nodes1=0 (6<=8), nodes2=0 (Judge not 0), nodes3=0 (6 not <5). Then proceed to the else of node2:

Then check node3 (0) → so into else (round between5-8):

Then check node4 (Judge ==1 → no → node4=0 → so prediction 0.

That's okay.

Another case: official=1, Round=5, Judge=1 → nodes4=1 → prediction 1.

Yes.

Now, what about when Official is 0, but Round=10 → then since it's not official, prediction is 0 regardless.

Hmm, that's okay.

Another case: Official=0, Round=3, Judge=0 → prediction 0.

Yes.

I think this structure works. Since it uses all 5 nodes and covers all paths.

Alternatively, maybe the nodes are ordered differently, but I think this is a possible correct answer.

Alternatively, maybe the nodes could be arranged differently. But since the user didn't give specifics, this should be acceptable.

Therefore, the code above should be correct.
