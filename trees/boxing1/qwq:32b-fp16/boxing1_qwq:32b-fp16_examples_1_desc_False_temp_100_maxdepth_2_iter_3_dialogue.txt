<think>
Okay, I need to build a decision tree classifier for determining which boxer (Lewis or Holyfield) won each round, based on the given features. The maximum depth is 2, so I can only have two levels of decisions. Let me start by understanding the features provided.

The features are: Judge (with various options like E. Williams, L. O'Connell, etc.), Official judge (yes/no), and Round (1 to 12). The target variable is who won the round, either Lewis or Holyfield.

First, I need to figure out which features are the most important. Since we can only use two levels, I should choose the feature that best splits the data first. Let me think about each feature's potential impact.

1. **Judge**: There are multiple judges here. Maybe some judges tend to favor one boxer more than others. For example, maybe E. Williams often scores rounds for Lewis, while another judge prefers Holyfield. If a particular judge's scoring pattern is consistent, this could be a strong first split.

2. **Official judge (yes/no)**: This might indicate whether the judge's score is considered official. If official judges have a different scoring pattern, this could be a useful split. For instance, maybe official judges are more balanced, or maybe they lean one way.

3. **Round (1 to 12)**: The round number might matter because as the fight progresses, maybe one boxer starts to dominate. For example, in later rounds, Lewis might be winning more rounds, or maybe Holyfield started strong in the early rounds.

Now, to decide the best first split. Since the example provided in the question used petal width first because it had the highest information gain or Gini impurity, I need to do something similar here. But since I don't have the actual data, I have to make an educated guess based on typical boxing scoring and the features given.

Boxing judges often score rounds based on who they see as dominant. Official judges are the ones whose scores are counted for the final decision, so maybe the official judges have a more consistent scoring pattern. Alternatively, the round number might be a better indicator if the fight had a clear progression. But without data, I'll assume that the Judge is the most important feature because different judges might have different preferences, and the round might be a secondary factor.

Wait, but with maximum depth 2, after splitting on the first feature, the next split can only be on one other feature. Let me structure this.

Suppose the first split is on the Judge. Let's say the most important judge is, for example, E. Williams. If the judge is E. Williams, then maybe the majority of his rounds go to Lewis. Then, the next split could be on the Round. Alternatively, maybe the first split is on whether it's an official judge. If official judges are more likely to score a certain way, then splitting on that first, then maybe the round or judge.

Alternatively, maybe Round is the first split. For example, in rounds 1-6, Holyfield is winning, but in rounds 7-12, Lewis takes over. Then, the next split could be the judge or official status.

But since the user's example used a numerical feature (petal width) first, maybe here the numerical feature is Round. Let me consider that.

Alternatively, the Judge has multiple categories, so splitting on a categorical variable with many categories might not be efficient. However, in decision trees, categorical variables can be split by choosing a subset of categories. But perhaps the most impactful split is between official and non-official judges.

Hmm. Let me think of a plausible structure.

Let me try to outline possible splits:

Option 1:
First split on Round <= 6 vs >6. Then, for each, maybe split on Official Judge (yes/no) or the Judge's name.

Option 2:
First split on Official Judge (yes/no). Then, for each, split on Round (e.g., early vs late) or the judge.

Alternatively, first split on a particular judge. For example, if E. Williams is the most frequent or decisive judge, split on whether the judge is E. Williams. Then, the next splits could be on Round or official status.

Since the maximum depth is 2, each path after the first split can only have one more split.

Let me try to build it step by step.

Assuming that the most important feature is the Round. Let's say rounds 1-6 are early, 7-12 later. Suppose Lewis started strong, then Holyfield took over, or vice versa. Alternatively, maybe in the first split, Round <= 6 vs >6. Then, in each branch, split on whether the judge is official. For example:

Root: Round <= 6?
- If yes, then split on Official Judge (yes/no). Suppose official judges in early rounds favor Holyfield, non-official might split differently.
- If no (rounds 7-12), split on Official Judge again.

Alternatively, maybe the official judges are consistent, so splitting first on official status.

Wait, but the user's example used a numerical split first. Let me try to structure the decision tree with two levels.

Another approach: The first split is on whether the judge is an official judge. If it's an official judge, then the next split could be on the round. For example:

Root: Official Judge = yes?
- Yes: Then split on Round (e.g., <=8 or >8)
- No: Maybe split on the judge's name, but since max depth is 2, the next level can only be one split. Alternatively, if not official, maybe the round is less important, so perhaps the next split is on the judge's name, but since that's categorical, we can split into one category vs others.

Wait, perhaps the first split is on the Round being in the first half or second half. Let me pick an arbitrary midpoint. Suppose the first split is Round <=6 vs >6.

Then, for each of those, the next split could be on the Official judge (yes/no). For example:

- If Round <=6:
   - If Official Judge yes: class Holyfield
   - If Official Judge no: class Lewis
- If Round >6:
   - If Official Judge yes: class Lewis
   - If Official Judge no: class Holyfield

But this is just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the official judges are more accurate, so splitting on that first.

Alternatively, perhaps the Judge's name is the most important. For example, if the judge is E. Williams, then Lewis wins, else split on Round.

But since there are multiple judges, maybe the most impactful is a specific judge. Suppose that among the judges, E. Williams and HBO-Lederman are official, and others are not. Or maybe the presence of being an official judge is key.

Alternatively, let's think of the decision tree structure as follows:

First, the root split is on the Official Judge (yes/no). Because if the judge is official, their scoring might be more reliable or follow a pattern.

Root: Official Judge = yes?
- Yes (Official):
   - Then split on Round (e.g., <= 8 or >8)
- No (Non-official):
   - Split on Judge, maybe selecting a particular judge like E. Williams.

Wait, but since we can only have two levels, after the first split (Official yes/no), each branch can only have one more split. Let me try to structure it.

Alternatively, first split on Round. Suppose Round <= 6 vs >6.

Then for each:

- If Round <=6:
   - Split on Official Judge (yes/no)
- If Round >6:
   - Split on Official Judge (yes/no)

This way, depth is 2. The leaves would then have the classes based on those splits.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the judge being HBO-Lederman (assuming that's an official one) or another.

Alternatively, the best first split might be the Official Judge because it's a binary feature, so splitting there first can create two branches, each of which can be further split on Round or another feature.

Let me try building the tree step by step with these considerations.

First split: Official Judge (yes/no). Suppose that official judges are more likely to have a consistent pattern. Let's say:

Root: Official Judge = yes?
- Yes:
   - Then split on Round (e.g., <=8 vs >8)
- No:
   - Then split on Round (e.g., <=4 vs >4)

Wait, but how does that determine the class? Alternatively, maybe after the official split, the next split is on round to decide the class.

Alternatively, the second split on each branch could be on the judge's name, but since judge has many categories, it's better to pick a numerical split. Round is numerical, so that's better.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on Round, then on Official. Let me try:

Root: Round <=6?
- Yes:
   - Split on Official Judge (yes/no)
- No:
   - Split on Official Judge (yes/no)

This would give four leaves. For example:

If Round is early (<=6) and official judge, maybe Holyfield won. If early and not official, maybe Lewis. If later round (>6) and official, maybe Lewis, and so on.

But I need to make it such that each path ends in a class. Since I don't have actual data, I have to assume plausible splits based on typical boxing dynamics.

In the 1987 or 1993 Lewis vs Holyfield fights, maybe Lewis was dominant in later rounds. So, suppose:

Root: Round > 8?
- If yes: split on Official Judge (yes/no)
   - If Official yes: Lewis
   - If Official no: Maybe Holyfield (if non-official judges are more inconsistent)
- If no (Round <=8):
   - Split on Official Judge
      - Official yes: Holyfield
      - Official no: Maybe split again but can't, so perhaps Holyfield or Lewis?

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on the Official Judge. Suppose official judges are more likely to favor Lewis in later rounds.

Alternatively, here's another approach. Let's pick the two most impactful features. Round and Official Judge. Let's use Round first, then Official.

Decision Tree:

Root: Round > 6?
- If yes (rounds 7-12):
   - Then split on Official Judge (yes/no)
      - If Official yes: Lewis
      - If Official no: Holyfield
- If no (rounds 1-6):
   - Then split on Official Judge (yes/no)
      - If Official yes: Holyfield
      - If Official no: Lewis

This way, the tree uses Round first, then Official Judge, both at depth 2. Each leaf is a class (Lewis or Holyfield). This makes sense if in the first half rounds, official judges favor Holyfield, but non-official might give to Lewis, and in later rounds, official go to Lewis, non-official to Holyfield. But this is a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is Official Judge, then Round. For instance:

Root: Official Judge = yes?
- Yes:
   - Split on Round >8? 
      - If yes: Lewis
      - No: Holyfield
- No (Non-official):
   - Split on Round >4?
      - If yes: Holyfield
      - No: Lewis

But again, without data, this is speculative.

Alternatively, the user's example used a numerical feature first (petal width), so following that, maybe Round is the first split. Let's pick a midpoint like 6.5, so Round <=6 vs >6.

Then, on each branch, split on Official Judge (yes/no). For example:

|--- Round <=6
||--- Official Judge = yes
||||--- class: Holyfield
||--- Official Judge = no
||||--- class: Lewis
|--- Round >6
||--- Official Judge = yes
||||--- class: Lewis
||--- Official Judge = no
||||--- class: Holyfield

This structure uses Round first, then Official Judge, with maximum depth 2. The classes are assigned based on possible assumptions. For instance, in the first six rounds, official judges might give Holyfield more points, while non-official might lean Lewis. In later rounds, the official judges favor Lewis, perhaps as he took control, while non-official might still give Holyfield.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the Official Judge, then Round. Let's see:

|--- Official Judge = yes
||--- Round <=8
||||--- class: Holyfield
||--- Round >8
||||--- class: Lewis
|--- Official Judge = no
||--- Round <=4
||||--- class: Lewis
||--- Round >4
||||--- class: Holyfield

But again, this is just a made-up structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the most important feature is the Judge's name. Suppose that among all judges, HBO-Lederman is an official judge and consistently scores for Lewis. So first split on Judge being HBO-Lederman or not. Then, maybe split on Round. But since there are many judges, splitting on a specific judge might not capture all.

Alternatively, since the example used a numerical split first, and the Round is numerical, let's go with Round as the first split. Let's choose a midpoint. Suppose the decisive point is round 7. So:

Root: Round > 6.5 (i.e., round 7 to 12)

Then, the next split could be on the Official Judge. For example:

If Round is later (>6.5), then split on Official Judge:

- If Official yes, then Lewis (assuming official judges favor Lewis in later rounds)
- If Official no, maybe Holyfield (as non-official might have different views)

Similarly, for early rounds:

- If Official yes, Holyfield
- If Official no, maybe Lewis

This gives a tree with depth 2.

So structuring it:

Decision Tree:

|--- Round > 6.5
||--- Official Judge = yes
|||--- class: Lewis
||--- Official Judge = no
|||--- class: Holyfield
|--- Round <=6.5
||--- Official Judge = yes
|||--- class: Holyfield
||--- Official Judge = no
|||--- class: Lewis

This seems plausible. Alternatively, the classes could be flipped depending on assumptions, but without data, this is the best guess. The structure uses the two most impactful features: Round and Official Judge, each at depth 1 and 2 respectively.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on whether the judge is official, then on round. Let's see:

|--- Official Judge = yes
||--- Round >8
|||--- class: Lewis
||--- Round <=8
|||--- class: Holyfield
|--- Official Judge = no
||--- Round >4
|||--- class: Holyfield
||--- Round <=4
|||--- class: Lewis

But again, without data, it's hard to be certain. The user's example used a numerical feature first, so following that pattern, Round (numerical) first makes sense.

Therefore, I'll proceed with the first structure I thought of, using Round as the first split, then Official Judge as the second, resulting in a maximum depth of 2.
</think>

Decision Tree:

|--- Round > 6.5
||--- Official Judge = yes
|||--- class: Lewis
||--- Official Judge = no
|||--- class: Holyfield
|--- Round <=6.5
||--- Official Judge = yes
|||--- class: Holyfield
||--- Official Judge = no
|||--- class: Lewis

**Explanation:**  
The tree splits first on the **Round** (using a midpoint at 6.5 to distinguish early vs later rounds). In later rounds (>6.5), official judges are assumed to favor **Lewis**, while non-official judges might split differently. In the first half of the fight (≤6.5), official judges prefer **Holyfield**, and non-official judges lean toward **Lewis**. This structure uses the two most impactful features (Round and Official Judge) within the depth constraint.


#########################


<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a Python function that mimics a decision tree based on the given features. The features are Judge, Official, Round, and the target is which fighter won the round. The example provided uses a decision tree structure with nodes and returns a prediction along with a list of node truth values.

First, I need to figure out what the decision tree structure is supposed to be. Since the user didn't provide the actual decision tree, I have to make some assumptions. The example given uses HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level for diabetes prediction, so maybe the user expects a similar structure here but adapted to the boxing scenario.

The features here are:

- Judge: an integer from 0 to 9 representing different judges.
- Official: 1 if the judge is official, 0 otherwise.
- Round: the round number from 1 to 12.
- Target is 1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield.

Hmm, the problem mentions that if there are placeholders for thresholds, to fill them with meaningful values. Since there's no explicit tree provided, I need to create a plausible one. Let me think about how a decision tree might split based on these features.

Possible splits could be:

1. Maybe first check if the judge is official. If not, maybe they're less experienced, so the decision might be different?
Wait, but the target is who won the round. Maybe the official status could influence the outcome, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the Round number might be a factor. Like, in later rounds, maybe one fighter is tiring, so the decision might favor the other.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the Judge. For example, if the judge is a certain person (like E. Williams, which is 0), then the decision might lean a certain way. But since there are 10 judges, that might be too many splits. Alternatively, maybe split based on whether the judge is from a certain group, like if Judge is less than a certain value.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Round. For instance, if the round is greater than 8, maybe the decision is more likely to be Lewis. But without data, I have to make educated guesses.

Alternatively, maybe the decision tree starts with the Official feature. Suppose if the judge is official (Official=1), then check another feature. Let's think of a possible structure.

Let me try to come up with a simple tree of depth 2 as in the example. Let's say the first split is on Round. For example, if Round <= 6, then proceed to check another condition. Let's pick a threshold for Round, maybe 6. Then the next split could be on the Judge. For instance, if Judge is 0 (E. Williams), then predict Holyfield (0). Otherwise, maybe Lewis (1).

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the Official status. Suppose if the judge is official (Official=1), then check the round. For example, if Round > 8, predict Lewis (1), else Holyfield (0). If not official, maybe predict based on Judge's identity. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, here's another approach. Let's structure it such that the first node is Round. Let's say the first split is Round <= 6. Then, if yes, check another condition like Judge being a certain value. Suppose for Round <=6, if the Judge is HBO-Lederman (3), then predict 1 (Lewis), else 0. Or maybe the second split is Official. For instance, if Round <=6 and Official is 1, then predict 1, else 0.

Alternatively, perhaps the first node is the Official status. Suppose if the judge is official, then check Round. Let's say if Round is less than 8, then predict 0, else 1. If not official, maybe check the Judge's number. For example, if Judge is less than 5, predict 1 else 0. But I need to make sure the thresholds are reasonable.

Wait, let me structure it step by step. Let's think of a simple tree of depth 2, like the example given. The example had two nodes: first splitting on HbA1c_level, then on blood_glucose_level.

So, following that structure, the function's nodes list has two elements. Let's do the same here. Maybe the first split is on Round. Let's choose a threshold, say 8. So nodes[0] is X["Round"] <=8.

Then, the second node could be on the Official status. For instance, nodes[1] = X["Official"]==1. 

Then, based on these, the prediction would be determined. 

For example:

If nodes[0] (Round <=8) is true:
   if nodes[1] (Official is 1) is true, predict 0 (Holyfield)
   else (not official), predict 1 (Lewis)
else (Round >8):
   predict 1 (Lewis)

Alternatively, perhaps another combination. Let's think of possible predictions. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Judge. Let's say if Judge is less than 5, then check another feature like Round. Suppose the first node is Judge < 5, and the second node is Round >8. 

But since the user's example uses thresholds (like <=6.7 and <=210), maybe I should pick thresholds that are within the possible ranges. 

The Round goes from 1 to 12. So thresholds could be 6, 8, 10, etc. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the Official feature. So nodes[0] is X["Official"] ==1. 

Then, the second node could be Round. Suppose if official is yes, then check if Round is less than 7. 

So putting it all together:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [0, 0]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <=6
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 1  # maybe if not official, regardless of round, predict Lewis?
    
    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but this is just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the first split is Round <=8, and second on Judge. 

Alternatively, let's think of the target variable as which fighter won the round. Maybe in later rounds, Lewis is more likely to win, so Round being higher might predict Lewis. 

So, perhaps:

First node: Round <=8 (nodes[0] = X["Round"] <=8)

Second node: Official ==1 (nodes[1] = X["Official"]==1)

Then:

If nodes[0] is true (round is early), then check if Official. If official, maybe they are more strict, so predict 0 (Holyfield). If not official, maybe they are lenient, so predict 1 (Lewis). 

Else (round >8), perhaps predict Lewis (1) regardless. 

So the code would be:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [0, 0]
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <=8
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] ==1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction =1
    else:
        prediction =1
    
    return prediction, nodes

This seems plausible. The nodes list would have two entries. Each entry is 1 if the condition is met. 

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on the judge's identity. For example, after Round <=8, check if the judge is, say, HBO-Lederman (3). But then the threshold would be Judge <3 or something. 

Alternatively, perhaps the second split is on another feature. Since there are three features (Judge, Official, Round), I can choose any for the splits. The example used two different features. 

Alternatively, another approach: 

First split on Judge's value. Suppose if the judge is one of the first few (say, Judge <3), then check another feature like Round. 

But without knowing the actual data, I have to make assumptions. 

Alternatively, let's see the example again. The example's first node was HbA1c_level <= 6.7, which is a threshold on a continuous variable. Then the second node was blood_glucose_level <=210. 

In our case, Round is continuous (1-12), so maybe first split on Round. 

So perhaps the first node is Round <=6. 

Second node could be Official ==1. 

Then:

If Round <=6: 

   if official, predict 0 (Holyfield)

   else, predict 1 (Lewis)

Else (Round >6):

   predict 1 (Lewis)

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on Judge. For example, if the judge is 0 (E. Williams), then predict 0, else 1. 

So, let's code that:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [0,0]
    nodes[0] = X['Round'] <=6
    nodes[1] = X['Judge'] ==0  # For example, if the Judge is E. Williams
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =0
        else:
            prediction =1
    else:
        prediction =1
    
    return prediction, nodes

But the thresholds need to be meaningful. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is Judge <5, then split on Round. 

Alternatively, let's think of the target as 1 (Lewis) being more probable in later rounds. 

So, maybe first split on Round >8 (nodes[0] = X['Round']>8), and then second split on Official. 

Like:

nodes[0] = X['Round']>8

nodes[1] = X['Official'] ==1

if nodes[0] is true (round after 8):

   then if official, maybe predict 1 (Lewis)

   else, perhaps not. 

Wait, but the structure in the example is if first condition is true, then check second condition. 

Alternatively, the code structure would be:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [0,0]
    nodes[0] = X['Round'] >8
    nodes[1] = X['Official'] ==1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =1
        else:
            prediction =0
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =0
        else:
            prediction =1  # Not sure
    
Hmm, this might be getting too complicated. 

Perhaps the best way is to choose a simple structure with two nodes. Let me pick the first split as Round <=6. 

Second split on Official. 

Then:

if Round <=6:

   if Official is 1 (yes), predict 0 (Holyfield)

   else (not official), predict 1 (Lewis)

else (Round>6):

   predict 1 (Lewis)

This way, in the first half of the fight, official judges might be more inclined to Holyfield, but non-official might favor Lewis. In later rounds, regardless of judge, Lewis wins. 

So coding that:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [0, 0]
    nodes[0] = X['Round'] <=6
    nodes[1] = X['Official'] ==1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =0
        else:
            prediction =1
    else:
        prediction =1
    
    return prediction, nodes

Yes, that seems okay. The nodes list will have two entries, each 1 or 0 indicating whether the condition was met. 

Alternatively, maybe the second split is on a different feature. Let me check if I can use Judge. 

Suppose first split is Official ==1 (nodes[0] = X['Official'] ==1). 

Then, second split is Judge <5 (nodes[1] = X['Judge'] <5). 

Then:

if nodes[0] (Official yes):

   if nodes[1] (Judge is 0-4), predict 0, else (5-9) predict 1.

Else (not official):

   predict 1.

But this requires more splits. 

Alternatively, perhaps the second node is Round again. 

But the example had two different features. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Official, then on Round. 

def predict(X):
    nodes = [0,0]
    nodes[0] = X['Official'] ==1
    nodes[1] = X['Round'] <=8
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =0
        else:
            prediction =1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =1
        else:
            prediction =0
    
    return prediction, nodes

Hmm, but this is getting more complex. The user's example only had two nodes, so perhaps the second path (else in the first condition) just takes a direct prediction. 

In the example, after the first condition (nodes[0]), if it's true, then check the second condition. Else, the prediction is directly 1. 

So in the first example, if nodes[0] is false (HbA1c >6.7), then regardless of the second node, it's 1. 

Following that structure, perhaps the second split only happens when the first is true, and else it takes a path. 

So in my case, following the first example's structure, if the first node is true (Round <=6), then check the second node (Official). Else, directly predict 1. 

That way, the code structure is similar to the example's. 

Therefore, the code I wrote earlier should be okay. 

Another thing to note is that the nodes list must be the same length as the depth of the tree. Since the example had depth 2 (two nodes), here the function also has two nodes. 

So the final function would look like:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0,0]
    nodes[0] = X['Round'] <=6
    nodes[1] = X['Official'] ==1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction =1
    else:
        prediction =1
    
    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but in the example, the nodes list was initialized as 2 * [None], but in Python, you can just assign as a list of two elements. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user expects the nodes to be in the order of the splits. So first node is first split, second is the second. 

This should work. Now, to make sure that all the feature names are correctly spelled. The features are 'Judge', 'Official', 'Round', and the target is 'target'. 

Yes, in the code above, using X['Round'] and X['Official'] is correct. 

Another possible threshold for Round: maybe 8 instead of 6. Let me think again. 

If the first split is Round <=8, then:

nodes[0] = X['Round'] <=8

nodes[1] = X['Official'] ==1

Then:

if first is true (round 1-8):

   if official, predict 0, else predict 1

else (round 9-12):

   predict 1 (Lewis)

So maybe that's better, since in later rounds (9-12), Lewis is more likely. 

So code:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [0,0]
    nodes[0] = X['Round'] <=8
    nodes[1] = X['Official'] ==1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =0
        else:
            prediction =1
    else:
        prediction =1
    
    return prediction, nodes

That's better. 

Alternatively, maybe the second condition is on Judge. 

But without knowing the data, it's hard. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Official, then on Round. 

def predict(X):
    nodes = [0,0]
    nodes[0] = X['Official'] ==1
    nodes[1] = X['Round'] <=6
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =0
        else:
            prediction =1
    else:
        prediction =1
    
    return prediction, nodes

This also works. 

But the user might expect any structure as long as it uses two features and has two nodes. 

Alternatively, maybe the first node is Judge <5, second node Official. 

But I think the first approach using Round and Official is better. 

Therefore, the final answer would be one of these, but I need to choose. Let me go with the first version where nodes[0] is Round <=8, nodes[1] is Official ==1. 

Thus, the code is as above. 

Checking for syntax: 

- Using X['Round'] and X['Official'] 

- The return statement has prediction and nodes (list of two booleans). 

Yes. 

So the final answer is:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0, 0]
    nodes[0] = X['Round'] <= 8
    nodes[1] = X['Official'] == 1

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
