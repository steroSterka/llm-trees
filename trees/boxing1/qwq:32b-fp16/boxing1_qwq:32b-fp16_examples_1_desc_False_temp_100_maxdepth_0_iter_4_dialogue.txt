Okay, so I need to create a decision tree classifier to determine which of the two fighters, Lewis or Holyfield, won each round based on the given features. The features provided are Judge (with several options), Official Judge (yes/no), and Round (1 to 12). 

First, I should think about how each feature might influence the outcome. The decision tree should split the data at each node based on the feature that provides the most information gain or the best split, right? But since I don't have the actual data, I have to make some educated guesses based on typical boxing scenarios and common sense.

Starting with the Judges: There are multiple judges listed here. Maybe some judges have a tendency to favor one fighter over the other? For example, maybe one judge is known to lean towards Lewis, while another towards Holyfield. But without data, I might have to consider the "Official Judge" category. If a judge is marked as an official judge, perhaps their decisions are more critical, so maybe the official status is a key factor. 

Then there's the Round number. The round could affect the outcome because fighters might start strong or fade later. Maybe in the early rounds, one fighter is more aggressive, but in later rounds, the other takes over. For instance, perhaps Lewis was favored in earlier rounds, while Holyfield in later ones. Or maybe the opposite. I need to consider how rounds can influence the round outcomes.

The Official Judge feature is binary, so that's a straightforward split. Let's see. Maybe the first split is on whether the judge is official. If it's an official judge, their decision might be more reliable, so perhaps the tree splits there first. Let me think: Suppose the first split is on "Official Judge". 

If the judge is official (yes), then maybe the next split is on the round. For example, in rounds 1-6, Lewis might be winning more, and in rounds 7-12, Holyfield. Alternatively, maybe the round interacts with the judge's name. Hmm, but how to incorporate the judge's name into the splits?

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the Judge. But with so many judges, that might be too granular. Maybe group some judges? Wait, the problem didn't specify any particular data, so perhaps I need to structure it in a way that makes sense logically.

Alternatively, maybe the most important feature is the round. Suppose in certain rounds, one fighter is more dominant. Let's say that if the round is less than or equal to 6, Lewis wins, else Holyfield. But that might be too simplistic. Also, the judge's influence might come into play here.

Alternatively, the official judge's decision is more critical. Let me try building it step by step.

First, perhaps the first decision node is whether the judge is an official judge. If yes, then maybe the next split is on the round. For example:

- Official Judge = Yes:
  - If Round <=6, then Lewis wins
  - If Round >6, Holyfield wins

- Official Judge = No:
  - Then the decision might depend on the judge's name. For example, if the judge is E. Williams, maybe they favor Holyfield, so if Judge is E. Williams, then Holyfield; else, maybe split on another feature? But since there are many judges, maybe the non-official judges have varying tendencies. 

But without data, this is speculative. Alternatively, maybe the most important feature is the round, so split first on round. For instance:

- If Round <= X, then Lewis
- Else, Holyfield

But combining with judge's role. Let's think of a possible structure.

Alternatively, the official judge's decision could be more accurate, so maybe when it's an official judge, their decision is based on round. For non-official judges, maybe they have individual biases. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the round. Let's say:

- Round <= 6:
  - Then check if official judge. If yes, Lewis wins
  - If not official, then maybe split on judge's name. But how?

This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe the most straightforward way, given the features, is to start with the official judge status, then round, then judge name.

Wait, but the problem says to build the tree using the most important features. So perhaps the first split is on Official Judge, then Round, then specific judges.

Alternatively, maybe the round is the most important. Let me think of an example structure.

Let's try to build a plausible tree. Maybe:

First Split: Official Judge = Yes/No

If Official Judge is Yes:

   Split on Round <= 8:

      If yes (Round <=8), then Lewis wins

      If no (Round >8), Holyfield wins

If Official Judge is No:

   Split on Judge:

      If Judge is E. Williams or L. O'Connell, then Holyfield

      Else, maybe split on Round again, but this is getting complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the most important factor is the round. Suppose in rounds 1-6, Lewis is winning, and in 7-12, Holyfield. But that might not account for judges.

Alternatively, combine both. For example:

First Split: Round <= 6?

   If yes (round <=6):

      Then check official judge:

         If yes, Lewis

         If no, maybe split on judge name (e.g., certain judges favor Lewis here)

   If no (round >6):

      Then check official judge again, leading to Holyfield.

Alternatively, perhaps the official judges are more likely to favor Holyfield in later rounds. 

Wait, in the 1993 fight between Holyfield and Lewis, I recall that it was a close fight, but maybe the rounds went back and forth. However, without actual data, this is tricky. Alternatively, maybe the official judges are more accurate, so they might split based on round.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Round, then official judge.

Alternatively, another approach: Let's think of the features:

Features are Judge (multiple options), Official Judge (binary), Round (1-12).

The target is which fighter won the round (Lewis or Holyfield).

The decision tree needs to choose splits that best separate the classes.

Assuming that official judges have more weight, perhaps first split on Official Judge.

Then, for official judges, split on Round.

For example:

|--- Official Judge = Yes

|    |--- Round <= 6 → Lewis

|    |--- Round >6 → Holyfield

|--- Official Judge = No

|    |--- Judge is in a group that tends to favor Holyfield → Holyfield

|    |--- Else → Lewis

But the problem is that there are multiple judges, so maybe the non-official judges have different splits.

Alternatively, for non-official judges, the first split is on the judge's name.

Suppose among non-official judges:

Judge E. Williams often votes for Holyfield, so:

If Judge is E. Williams → Holyfield

Else, maybe check another feature like Round again.

Alternatively, maybe for non-official judges, the round is less important, and their bias is the main factor.

Alternatively, the tree could look like:

First split on Official Judge.

If Official Judge = Yes:

   Split on Round. Let's say if Round <= 6 → Lewis, else Holyfield.

If Official Judge = No:

   Split on Judge. For example, if the judge is among a subset (like E. Williams, L. O'Connell, etc.), they might have a preference.

Alternatively, maybe the non-official judges have a split based on their tendency. Let's say:

For non-official judges:

   If the judge is in a group that tends to favor Holyfield (say E. Williams and L. O'Connell), then Holyfield.

   Else (other non-official judges), maybe Lewis.

But this is hypothetical.

Alternatively, the first split is Round. Suppose:

Round <= 6 → Lewis

Round >6 → Split on Official Judge.

   If Official Judge = Yes → Holyfield

   If No → Maybe split on judge again.

Alternatively, but this might not be as clear.

Hmm. Since the example given with the iris dataset used a single feature (petal width) first, then split again on the same or another feature. Maybe here, the first feature is Round, then Official Judge, then Judge.

Alternatively, perhaps the most important feature is the Round, so first split on Round.

Suppose:

First split: Round <= 6 → Lewis

Else (Round >6):

   Split on Official Judge.

      If Yes → Holyfield

      If No → Split on Judge (maybe some judges favor Lewis here).

Alternatively, but without data, it's hard to tell. Let me think of a possible structure that makes sense.

Alternatively, considering that official judges might have more consistent scoring, perhaps their decisions are more based on the round progression, while non-official judges have varied preferences.

Alternatively, here's a possible decision tree structure:

Decision Tree:

|--- Official Judge = Yes

|    |--- Round <= 8 → Lewis

|    |    |--- (End node: Lewis)

|    |--- Round >8 → Holyfield

|         |--- (End node: Holyfield)

|--- Official Judge = No

|    |--- Judge is E. Williams or L. O'Connell → Holyfield

|    |    |--- (End node: Holyfield)

|    |--- Other Judges → Split on Round <= 6 → Lewis else Holyfield

Wait, but that might get too nested. Alternatively:

For non-official judges:

Split on Judge's name first. For example:

If the non-official judge is in a group that tends to favor Holyfield (like some judges), then Holyfield, else Lewis.

Alternatively, maybe for non-official judges, the decision is more on the round. For example, if they are non-official, their decisions might be random except for some preferences.

Alternatively, let me think of a simple structure that uses the features effectively. Maybe the first split is on the Official Judge status. Then, for official, split on Round; for non-official, split on Judge's name in a way.

Alternatively, here's another approach: 

Suppose that official judges are more likely to follow the round progression where Lewis is favored early and Holyfield later. Non-official judges might have their own biases. 

So the tree could be:

First split on Official Judge (Yes/No)

If Yes:

   Split on Round <= 6 → Lewis

   Else (Round >6) → Holyfield

If No (Non-official):

   Split on Judge. Suppose if the judge is one of the ones who tend to favor Holyfield (e.g., E. Williams), then Holyfield. Otherwise, maybe split on Round again?

Alternatively, for non-official judges, their decisions might be more variable, so maybe the next split is Round again but with different thresholds.

Alternatively, for non-official judges, maybe they favor Lewis in the first half and Holyfield in the second half, but with different thresholds. 

Alternatively, let's think of a tree where the first split is Official Judge, then Round for official, then for non-official, split on Judge name, and within that, maybe round.

Alternatively, perhaps the most straightforward way is to make the first split on Round, then Official Judge, then Judge.

But given that the example provided first splits on the most important feature (petal width), maybe Round is the most important here. Let's try:

First split on Round:

|--- Round <= 6 → Lewis

|--- Round >6 → Split on Official Judge.

    |--- Official Judge = Yes → Holyfield

    |--- Official Judge = No → Split on Judge name (e.g., if judge is in a group, then Holyfield else Lewis)

But this is getting too nested. Perhaps the second split after Round>6 for non-official judges would again split on Round? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe for non-official judges, even in later rounds, their votes might vary, so the next split is on the judge's name.

Alternatively, given the complexity, maybe the tree looks like this:

Decision Tree:

|--- Official Judge = Yes

|    |--- Round <= 6 → Lewis

|    |--- Round >6 → Holyfield

|--- Official Judge = No

|    |--- Judge is [E. Williams, L. O'Connell, etc.] → Holyfield

|    |--- Other Judges → Lewis

But this assumes that certain non-official judges favor Holyfield, which might be the case. Alternatively, maybe split on Round again for non-official judges but with different thresholds.

Alternatively, here's a possible structure that uses the features in a logical way, even without data:

The most important feature is the Official Judge status because their decisions are more critical and perhaps more consistent. So first split there.

Then, for official judges, their decision is based on the round progression.

For non-official judges, their decision might depend on their personal bias, so the next split is on the judge's name, but since there are many judges, maybe group them into those who favor Holyfield and others.

Alternatively, if we can't split on individual judges, maybe the next split is Round again but with different criteria.

Alternatively, here's the decision tree:

Decision Tree:

|--- Official Judge = Yes

|    |--- Round <= 6 → Lewis

|    |--- Round >6 → Holyfield

|--- Official Judge = No

|    |--- Round <= 6 → Lewis

|    |--- Round >6 → Split on Judge (e.g., if the judge is in a group that favors Holyfield, then Holyfield else Lewis)

Alternatively, maybe non-official judges in rounds >6 might still vote for Lewis or Holyfield depending on the judge.

Hmm, this is challenging without data. Let me try to form the simplest possible tree that uses the features provided.

First, Official Judge is likely important, so split there first.

Then, for official judges, split on Round to determine the winner based on early vs later rounds.

For non-official judges, perhaps split on Round again but with a different threshold, or split on the judge's name.

Alternatively, for non-official judges, maybe they have more varied decisions, so the next split could be on the judge's name, but since that's multiple categories, maybe we need to pick the most influential ones.

Alternatively, the non-official judges might have a split where in rounds 1-8, they side with Lewis, and 9-12 with Holyfield, but that's similar to official.

Alternatively, maybe the non-official judges have a different pattern.

Alternatively, to keep it simple, let's assume that non-official judges' decisions are less consistent and might be split on another feature, but since we have to use the given features, perhaps the next is Round.

Alternatively, here's a plausible tree:

|--- Official Judge = Yes

|    |--- Round <= 8 → Lewis

|    |    |--- (Lewis)

|    |--- Round >8 → Holyfield

|         |--- (Holyfield)

|--- Official Judge = No

|    |--- Round <= 6 → Lewis

|    |    |--- (Lewis)

|    |--- Round >6 → Split on Judge (e.g., if E. Williams, then Holyfield; else, Lewis)

But that requires splitting on Judge in a node which has multiple options, so maybe we need to choose a specific split.

Alternatively, for non-official judges with Round >6, maybe the judge's name determines it. Suppose among non-official judges, those who are more experienced (like E. Williams and L. O'Connell) might favor Holyfield, while others might still favor Lewis.

So:

For non-official, Round >6:

   If Judge is E. Williams or L. O'Connell → Holyfield

   Else → Lewis

Thus, the full tree would be:

Decision Tree:

|--- Official Judge = Yes

|    |--- Round <= 8 → Lewis

|    |--- Round >8 → Holyfield

|--- Official Judge = No

|    |--- Round <=6 → Lewis

|    |--- Round >6 → 

|         |--- Judge is E. Williams / L. O'Connell → Holyfield

|         |--- Other Judges → Lewis

This uses the features: Official Judge, Round, and then Judge for certain branches.

Alternatively, maybe the threshold for official judges is different. Let's say official judges switch at Round 7 instead of 8. Let me adjust that.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial split for official judges is at Round 6, as I thought earlier.

Let me try another version where the split for official judges is at Round 6:

Decision Tree:

|--- Official Judge = Yes

|    |--- Round <=6 → Lewis

|    |--- Round >6 → Holyfield

|--- Official Judge = No

|    |--- Round <=6 → Lewis

|    |--- Round >6 → 

|         |--- Judge in [E. Williams, L. O'Connell] → Holyfield

|         |--- Others → Lewis

This way, official judges switch at round 6, non-officials also switch at 6, but among non-officials after round 6, some judges favor Holyfield.

Alternatively, maybe non-official judges after round 6 have a split based on their name.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that official judges are more likely to follow the round progression, while non-official might not, but their votes depend on their preferences.

This seems plausible. Since I have to present this as the decision tree, I'll go with a structure that first splits on Official Judge, then Round for official, then for non-official splits on Round and then Judge for some cases.

Another consideration: The problem states to classify which fighter won each round, so the leaves are either Lewis or Holyfield.

Given the example provided in the question's iris dataset, the decision tree was built based on a single feature (petal width) with splits, so maybe here, the first split is on the most important feature, which might be Round, but I think Official Judge is more critical because it's a binary feature with clear implications on scoring consistency.

Thus, I'll structure the decision tree as follows:

Decision Tree:

|--- Official Judge = Yes

|    |--- Round ≤ 6 → Lewis

|    |--- Round > 6 → Holyfield

|--- Official Judge = No

|    |--- Round ≤ 6 → Lewis

|    |--- Round > 6 → 

|         |--- Judge is in a group favoring Holyfield (e.g., E. Williams, L. O'Connell) → Holyfield

|         |--- Other Judges → Lewis

But since the problem lists the judges as separate entries, maybe we need to split on individual judges, but that would lead to many branches. To keep it simple, group them.

Alternatively, if we can't assume any particular judge's preference, maybe for non-official judges after round 6, they might still vote for Lewis unless the round is very late (like >8). So:

Decision Tree:

|--- Official Judge = Yes

|    |--- Round ≤6 → Lewis

|    |--- Round >6 → Holyfield

|--- Official Judge = No

|    |--- Round ≤8 → Lewis

|    |--- Round >8 → Holyfield

This way, non-official judges follow a similar pattern but with a later switch. However, this might not use the Judge feature, which is available.

Alternatively, maybe the key differentiator for non-official is the judge's name. Suppose that certain judges always favor Holyfield.

For example:

Decision Tree:

|--- Official Judge = Yes

|    |--- Round ≤6 → Lewis

|    |--- Round >6 → Holyfield

|--- Official Judge = No

|    |--- Judge is E. Williams → Holyfield

|    |--- Other Judges → 

|         |--- Round ≤6 → Lewis

|         |--- Round >6 → Holyfield

This way, E. Williams (a non-official?) always votes Holyfield, while others follow round.

But the problem states the judges are listed, so maybe some are official and some are not. But the feature is whether the judge is official or not.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that non-official judges might have a different threshold. Like:

For non-official judges:

If Round >9 → Holyfield,

else Lewis,

but that might not utilize the Judge's name.

Hmm, this is tricky. Since the user probably expects a structure similar to the example, using the features in a logical path, I'll proceed with the first approach I thought of, using Official Judge first, then Round, and for non-official beyond a certain round, check the judge's name.

Here's the final structured decision tree:

Decision Tree:

|--- Official Judge = Yes

|    |--- Round ≤6 → Lewis

|    |--- Round >6 → Holyfield

|--- Official Judge = No

|    |--- Round ≤6 → Lewis

|    |--- Round >6 → 

|         |--- Judge is E. Williams or L. O'Connell → Holyfield

|         |--- Other Judges → Lewis

This way, it uses all three features: Official Judge, Round, and specific Judges. It's a logical structure where official judges follow round progression, and among non-official judges in the later rounds, certain judges favor Holyfield while others stick with Lewis.
</think>

The decision tree to classify which fighter (Lewis or Holyfield) won each round is structured as follows:

**Decision Tree:**

1. **First Split: Official Judge?**
   - **Yes (Official Judge):**
     - **Second Split: Round ≤6?**
       - **Yes → Lewis wins**
       - **No (Round >6) → Holyfield wins**
   - **No (Non-Official Judge):**
     - **Second Split: Round ≤6?**
       - **Yes → Lewis wins**
       - **No (Round >6):**
         - **Third Split: Is the judge E. Williams or L. O'Connell?**
           - **Yes → Holyfield wins**
           - **No (Other Judges) → Lewis wins**

---

### Explanation:
- **Official Judges** follow a clear round-based pattern: Lewis wins in rounds 1–6, and Holyfield wins in rounds 7–12.
- **Non-Official Judges** also favor Lewis in rounds 1–6. However, in later rounds (7–12):
  - Judges like **E. Williams** or **L. O'Connell** (who may have a bias) vote for Holyfield.
  - Other non-official judges continue favoring Lewis even in later rounds.

This structure leverages the **Official Judge status**, **Round number**, and **specific judge names** to predict the winner logically, mirroring the simplicity of the example provided.


#########################


<think>
Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to create a Python function based on a decision tree structure they provided, but they didn't actually give the decision tree details. Wait, the initial message mentions formatting their decision tree as a Python function, but in the example, the features are different (like petal_length, etc.), so maybe the actual tree for the boxing problem is missing here? Hmm, maybe I need to infer the decision tree structure based on the features and target they provided?

Looking at the features given for the boxing problem: Judge (categorical), Official (binary), Round (1-12), Target is which fighter won (0 or 1). The example function had a decision tree with conditions on different features, so I need to come up with similar conditions using the available features.

First, the target is predicting which fighter (Lewis or Holyfield) won the round. The features include the judge, whether it's an official judge, and the round number. 

I need to think of possible splits. Let's see. Maybe the first split could be based on the judge. Since Judge is categorical with 10 possible values, perhaps splitting on a specific judge's value. For example, if the judge is HBO-Lederman (value 3) or another, maybe they have a tendency to favor one fighter? Or perhaps official judges (Official=1) have different patterns.

Alternatively, maybe the round number is important. For instance, in later rounds, maybe one fighter is more tired, so the outcome changes. Maybe rounds above a certain number (like 8) could be a split.

Let me try to make a plausible decision tree structure. Let's start with the first node. Suppose the first split is on the Official judge. If it's an official judge (Official=1), then maybe the decision is different than non-official. Let's say:

Root node: Official == 1 ?

If yes (Official is 1), then maybe check the Judge. Suppose for official judges, if the judge is, say, ESPN (Judge=8), then the prediction might be different. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe split on Round. Like if it's an official judge and the round is greater than 6, then predict Lewis (1), else Holyfield (0). 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the Round. For example, if Round > 8, then maybe Lewis is more likely to win the round. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, let's think of possible thresholds. Let's try to create a simple tree. Let's assume the first split is on the judge. For instance:

First node: Judge == 3 (HBO-Lederman). If yes, then maybe predict 1. Otherwise, proceed.

Wait, but the example function had multiple nodes. Let me see. The example had nodes[0] to nodes[4], each being a condition. Then the code uses nested if-else based on those nodes.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the Official variable, then within that, split on Round, etc.

Let me try to outline a possible tree. Let's say:

Start with Official:

If Official is 1 (Yes), then check if the Round is greater than 6. If so, predict 1 (Lewis). Else, check the Judge. For example, if Judge is 8 (ESPN), predict 0, else predict 1.

Alternatively, maybe:

Root node: Official == 1 ?

If yes, then check Round. Suppose Round > 8, then predict 1. Else, check Judge. Suppose if Judge is 3 (HBO-Lederman), then predict 0, else 1.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Judge. Let's say if the judge is ESPN (8) or not. Suppose the first node is Judge ==8. Then, if yes, check another condition. 

Alternatively, let's think of possible conditions. Since the example had multiple nodes, maybe the tree has 5 nodes? Because in the example, nodes were 5 elements. The user's problem's function should return a list of the nodes' truth values, so the number of nodes in the tree would be the length of that list.

Hmm, since the user's example had 5 nodes, perhaps the boxing problem's tree also has 5 nodes. So I need to structure 5 conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the first node is Round <= 6. If yes, then check if Official is 1. Then if official is yes, check judge's identity.

Wait, this is getting a bit vague. Maybe I need to make some assumptions here. Since the user didn't provide the actual decision tree, perhaps I have to create a plausible one based on the features.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the Official variable. Let's try:

nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1

Then, if that's true, proceed to another condition. Let's say nodes[1] is X["Round"] > 8. So:

If nodes[0] is true (Official), then check nodes[1]. If Round >8, then maybe predict Lewis (1). Else, check another condition like Judge's value.

Alternatively, nodes[2] could be Judge == 8 (ESPN). 

Putting this together, the tree could be structured as:

Start with Official:

If Official is 1 (nodes[0] is True):

   Then check if Round >8 (nodes[1]):

      If yes, predict 1.

      Else, check if Judge is 8 (ESPN):

         nodes[2] = X["Judge"] ==8.

         If yes (nodes[2] is True), predict 0.

         Else, check another condition, like Round >5 (nodes[3]):

            If yes, predict 1, else 0?

Wait, this is getting a bit complex. Let me try to outline a possible structure.

Suppose the nodes are:

nodes[0] = X["Official"] ==1

nodes[1] = X["Round"] >8

nodes[2] = X["Judge"] ==8

nodes[3] = X["Round"] >5

nodes[4] = X["Judge"] ==3

Then the code could look like:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [0]*5
    nodes[0] = X['Official'] ==1
    nodes[1] = X['Round']>8
    nodes[2] = X['Judge'] ==8
    nodes[3] = X['Round']>5
    nodes[4] = X['Judge'] ==3

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction =0
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction =1
                else:
                    prediction =0
    else:
        if nodes[4]:
            prediction=1
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction=0
            else:
                prediction=1

    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but this is just a guess. The problem is that without knowing the actual decision tree structure, it's hard to know the exact splits. Since the user provided an example where the function uses conditions on the features, but in the actual problem's case, the features are different (Judge, Official, Round).

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the Round. Suppose the first node is Round <=6. Then, if yes, check Official. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe the first node is Round <= 6:

nodes[0] = X["Round"] <=6

Then, if that is true, check Official:

nodes[1] = X["Official"] ==1

Then, if Official is yes, check Judge's value, etc.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the Judge. Like Judge < 5 (since there are 10 judges, maybe splitting into first half and second). 

Alternatively, perhaps the decision tree is very simple with just a few splits. Let me think of a minimal example. Suppose the tree is:

If the judge is HBO-Lederman (3), then predict 1 (Lewis). Else, check if it's an official judge. If yes, predict 0; else, check the round. If round >8, predict 1 else 0.

So, translating that into nodes:

nodes[0] = X['Judge'] ==3

nodes[1] = X['Official'] ==1

nodes[2] = X['Round']>8

Then the code would be:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [0]*3
    nodes[0] = X['Judge'] ==3
    nodes[1] = X['Official'] ==1
    nodes[2] = X['Round']>8

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction =1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =0
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction=1
            else:
                prediction=0
    return prediction, nodes

But this uses only 3 nodes. Since the example had 5 nodes, maybe the user expects a similar number. So perhaps I need to come up with a structure with 5 nodes.

Alternatively, maybe the tree is more complex. Let me try to structure it with 5 nodes.

Suppose the nodes are as follows:

nodes[0] = X["Official"] ==1

nodes[1] = X["Round"] > 8

nodes[2] = X["Judge"] ==8 (ESPN)

nodes[3] = X["Judge"] ==3 (HBO-Lederman)

nodes[4] = X["Round"] >5

So the logic could be:

Start with Official:

if nodes[0] (Official is yes):

   if nodes[1] (Round>8):

      predict 1

   else:

      if nodes[2] (Judge is ESPN):

         predict 0

      else:

         if nodes[4] (Round>5):

             predict 1

         else:

             predict 0

else (Official is no):

   if nodes[3] (Judge is HBO):

       predict 1

   else:

       if nodes[4] (Round>5):

           predict 0

       else:

           predict 1

Hmm, this way, all 5 nodes are used. Let's code that:

def predict(X):
    nodes = 5*[None]
    nodes[0] = (X['Official'] == 1)
    nodes[1] = (X['Round'] >8)
    nodes[2] = (X['Judge'] ==8)
    nodes[3] = (X['Judge'] ==3)
    nodes[4] = (X['Round'] >5)
    
    prediction = 0  # default
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =1
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction =0
            else:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction =1
                else:
                    prediction=0
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction =1
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction =0
            else:
                prediction =1
                
    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but in this case, the nodes are filled correctly. Each node's condition is evaluated. The nodes list will have 5 elements, each 1 or 0 based on the condition. 

Alternatively, maybe the actual structure requires different conditions. But since the user didn't provide the tree, I have to make an educated guess. The problem says "fill placeholders for thresholds with meaningful values", so I need to choose plausible thresholds. 

Another possibility: the first split on Round. Suppose nodes[0] = X["Round"] <=6. Then if yes, check Official. Or maybe nodes[0] is Round > 6. 

Alternatively, let's try another approach. Since the target is whether Lewis won, perhaps certain judges are biased. For example, if the judge is HBO-Lederman (Judge 3), they might favor Lewis, so that's a split point. 

So nodes[0] = (X['Judge'] ==3). If yes, then predict 1 (Lewis). 

Else, check if it's an official judge. nodes[1] = (X['Official'] ==1). 

If official, then check Round. nodes[2] = (X['Round']>8). 

If Round>8, then predict 1, else 0. 

Else (not official), check another condition like Round>5 (nodes[3]). 

If yes, predict 0 else predict 1. 

But this would need more nodes. 

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Since the user's example uses 5 nodes and nested ifs, I should aim for a similar structure. 

Alternatively, maybe the decision tree is as follows:

The first split is on the Official judge. 

- If Official is yes (nodes[0] = X['Official'] ==1):

   next split on Round>8 (nodes[1]):

      if yes, predict 1.

      else, split on Judge ==8 (ESPN, nodes[2]):

         if yes, predict 0.

         else, split on Round>5 (nodes[3]):

             if yes, predict 1.

             else, predict 0.

- Else (Official no):

   split on Judge ==3 (nodes[3]):

      if yes, predict 1.

      else, split on Round>5 (nodes[4]):

          if yes, predict 0.

          else, predict 1.

Wait, but this uses nodes[0], [1], [2], [3], [4]. So all 5 nodes are used. 

Let me write this code:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [False]*5
    nodes[0] = (X['Official'] ==1)
    nodes[1] = (X['Round']>8)
    nodes[2] = (X['Judge'] ==8)
    nodes[3] = (X['Judge'] ==3)
    nodes[4] = (X['Round']>5)
    
    prediction = 0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =1
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction =0
            else:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction =1
                else:
                    prediction =0
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction =1
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction =0
            else:
                prediction =1
    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but in this case, nodes[3] and nodes[4] are used in both branches. 

Alternatively, maybe the code structure uses all nodes correctly. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on Judge. So nodes[0] is (X['Judge'] ==3), then nodes[1] for official, nodes[2] for Round>8, etc. 

But since I'm making this up, I think the key is to create a plausible structure with 5 conditions, and code it such that each condition is part of the logic. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the Round. Let's see:

nodes[0] = X['Round'] <=6

nodes[1] = X['Official'] ==1

nodes[2] = X['Judge'] ==8

nodes[3] = X['Judge'] ==3

nodes[4] = X['Round'] >8

Then the logic could be:

if nodes[0]:

   if nodes[1]:

      if nodes[2]:

          predict 0

      else:

          predict 1

   else:

      if nodes[3]:

          predict 1

      else:

          predict 0

else:

   if nodes[4]:

      predict 1

   else:

      predict 0

Hmm, but this uses nodes[0],1,2,3,4. 

But I'm not sure if this is the best way. 

Alternatively, the user might have expected a different structure, but given the lack of information, I'll proceed with the first structure I thought of with 5 nodes. 

Wait, the user's example has the following code structure:

def predict(X):
    nodes = 5*[None]
    # conditions here
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            # etc
    else:
        # etc

So the code branches based on the nodes in order. 

Another approach: Let's think of the decision tree as:

Root node: Official?

Yes ->

   Node: Round>8?

   Yes -> predict 1

   No -> 

       Node: Judge ==8?

       Yes -> predict 0

       No ->

           Node: Round>5?

           Yes -> predict 1

           No -> predict 0

No ->

   Node: Judge ==3?

   Yes -> predict 1

   No ->

       Node: Round>5?

       Yes -> predict0

       No -> predict1

This uses 5 nodes (nodes0 to 4):

nodes[0] = Official ==1

nodes[1] = Round>8

nodes[2] = Judge ==8

nodes[3] = Judge ==3

nodes[4] = Round>5

So the code would be:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [False]*5
    nodes[0] = (X['Official'] ==1)
    nodes[1] = (X['Round']>8)
    nodes[2] = (X['Judge'] ==8)
    nodes[3] = (X['Judge'] ==3)
    nodes[4] = (X['Round']>5)
    
    prediction =0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction =1
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction =0
            else:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction =1
                else:
                    prediction=0
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction =1
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction =0
            else:
                prediction =1
    return prediction, nodes

This code structure uses all 5 nodes and follows the logic described. 

I think this is a plausible answer given the problem constraints. It uses all nodes and plausible thresholds.
