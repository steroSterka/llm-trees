Alright, I need to help the user build a decision tree classifier using specific features. Let me start by understanding their request.

They provided an example with sepal and petal measurements, so they're familiar with classification trees. Now, they want a tree for boxing rounds using Judge, whether it's an Official judge, and Round number, max depth of 2.

First, I should consider what each feature represents. The Judge feature has various names, which might indicate different judges' tendencies. But without data on how each judge scores, it's hard to use this effectively. Maybe grouping them or considering their reputations could help, but that's speculative.

The Official judge feature is a yes/no, which seems important. Official judges are likely more experienced and accurate, so their scores might be more reliable. This could be the primary splitter in the tree.

Round number ranges from 1 to 12. Generally, early rounds might be feeling-out periods, while later rounds show endurance. However, without knowing specific trends, it's tricky. Maybe using mid-rounds as a split point makes sense.

Given the max depth of 2, I can only have two levels of splits. I'll start with the most important feature, which is likely Official judge. If it's yes, maybe Holyfield has an edge since he's known for strong performances. If no, perhaps Lewis, as he might have more media influence.

For the second level, using Round makes sense. Splitting rounds into early (1-4), mid (5-8), and late (9-12). Early rounds could favor Holyfield, mid could be even, and late rounds might go to Lewis due to stamina.

I need to structure this clearly. The root node splits on Official judge, then each child splits on Round ranges. This should create a simple yet effective tree.

Wait, but the user's example didn't use all features; maybe they want minimal features. So focusing on the two most impactful: Official and Round.

I think this approach makes sense. It uses the most relevant features and keeps it within the depth limit. I'll present the tree with explanations so the user understands each decision point.

To build a decision tree classifier for determining which of the two boxing fighters (Lewis or Holyfield) won each round, we will use the following features:

1. **Judge**: The specific judge evaluating the round (e.g., E. Williams, L. O'Connell, etc.)
2. **Official Judge**: Whether the judge is an official judge (yes/no).
3. **Round**: The specific round number (1 to 12).

Given that we want a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, we will focus on using the most important features to split the data into classes (Lewis or Holyfield). Here's how the decision tree might look:

---

### Decision Tree:
|--- Official Judge: yes  
||--- Round <= 6  
||||--- class: Holyfield  
||--- Round > 6  
||||--- class: Lewis  
|--- Official Judge: no  
||--- Round <= 6  
||||--- class: Holyfield  
||--- Round > 6  
||||--- class: Lewis  

---

### Explanation:
1. **First Split (Root Node)**: The first split is based on whether the judge is an "Official Judge" or not. This is a logical starting point because official judges are typically more experienced and have a higher credibility in scoring fights.
2. **Second Split**: For both cases of the first split ("Official Judge: yes" and "Official Judge: no"), we further split based on the round number:
   - Rounds 1-6 are considered early to mid-rounds, where Holyfield might have an advantage due to his strong conditioning and defensive skills.
   - Rounds 7-12 are considered late rounds, where Lewis might gain the upper hand due to his power punching and stamina.

This decision tree assumes that official judges are more consistent in their scoring and that both fighters' performance trends align with general expectations (Holyfield's precision early on and Lewis's power later in the fight). Adjustments can be made if additional data or specific judge tendencies are provided.

Alright, I need to help the user by formatting their decision tree as a Python function. The goal is to create a function that predicts which boxer won a round and returns both the prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

First, let me recap the decision tree structure they provided earlier:

1. **Root Node**: Split based on whether the judge is an "Official Judge" (Yes/No).
2. **Second Split**: For each case of the first split, further split based on the round number:
   - Rounds 1-6: Holyfield
   - Rounds 7-12: Lewis

The function needs to take a dictionary `X` with keys like 'Judge', 'Official', 'Round', etc., and return a prediction (0 for Holyfield, 1 for Lewis) along with a list of booleans representing the inner node conditions.

I need to map the 'Official' feature correctly. From the user's input, 'Official' is encoded as 1 for Yes and 0 for No. So, in the function, I'll check if `X['Official']` equals 1 to determine if it's an official judge.

Next, based on whether it's an official judge, I need to evaluate the round number. If it's an official judge (Official == 1), then:
- If Round is between 1 and 6, Holyfield wins.
- If Round is 7 or higher, Lewis wins.

If it's not an official judge, I'll assume a default behavior. Since the user didn't specify non-official judges' tendencies, I'll default to Holyfield for Rounds 1-6 and Lewis for 7-12, similar to the official case but without the Official condition affecting it directly.

The function should then return the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of two boolean values representing the inner node conditions. The first node is whether the judge is official, and the second is whether the round is less than or equal to 6.

I also need to ensure that the keys in the dictionary match exactly as specified by the user, paying attention to cases and spaces. So, I'll use `X['Official']` and `X['Round']`.

Testing this function with sample inputs will help verify its correctness. For example:
- If Official is 1 and Round is 5: prediction should be 0 (Holyfield), nodes [True, True].
- If Official is 1 and Round is 8: prediction should be 1 (Lewis), nodes [True, False].
- If Official is 0 and Round is 3: prediction should be 0 (Holyfield), nodes [False, True].
- If Official is 0 and Round is 10: prediction should be 1 (Lewis), nodes [False, False].

This ensures that all possible cases are covered and the function behaves as expected.

Hereâ€™s a Python function that implements your decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First inner node: whether it's an official judge (1 = Yes)
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Second inner node: round <= 6
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0 if nodes[1] else 1
    else:
        prediction = 0 if nodes[1] else 1
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Inner Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks whether the judge is an official judge (`Official == 1`).
   - `nodes[1]`: Checks whether the round number is less than or equal to 6.

2. **Prediction Logic**:
   - If it's an official judge (`nodes[0]` is True):
     - Holyfield wins if the round is <= 6 (`nodes[1]` is True).
     - Lewis wins if the round is > 6 (`nodes[1]` is False).
   - If it's not an official judge (`nodes[0]` is False):
     - Holyfield wins if the round is <= 6 (`nodes[1]` is True).
     - Lewis wins if the round is > 6 (`nodes[1]` is False).

3. **Return Values**:
   - `prediction`: 1 if Lewis won the round, 0 if Holyfield won.
   - `nodes`: A list of boolean values indicating whether the conditions for the inner nodes were satisfied.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Sample input dictionary
sample_input = {
    "Judge": 3,
    "Official": 1,
    "Round": 8,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(sample_input)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 1 (Lewis won)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: [True, False]
```

This function assumes that the input dictionary `X` contains valid values for the "Official" and "Round" features.
