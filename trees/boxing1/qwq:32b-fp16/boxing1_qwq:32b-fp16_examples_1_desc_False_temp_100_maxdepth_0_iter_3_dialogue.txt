Okay, so the user wants me to create a decision tree classifier to determine which boxer, Lewis or Holyfield, won a round based on the given features. The features provided are the judge's name, whether they're an official judge, and the round number from 1 to 12. 

First, I need to understand the problem. The original example they gave was about the iris dataset, which is a classic classification problem. The decision tree there splits on petal width, leading to different classes. Now, applying that to boxing rounds, the target classes would be "Lewis" or "Holyfield".

Let me start by considering the features. The judges can be different entities, some official and some not. The round number might also be a factor because strategies can change as the fight progresses. 

I should think about which feature is most important. Maybe the official judge's decision is critical because non-official ones might not influence the official result. Wait, but the question is about which fighter won the round according to the judges. Hmm, actually, the official judge's status might indicate if their score is counted towards the official result. But the problem says "classify which of the two boxing fighters (Lewis and Holyfield) won each the round". So maybe each judge's vote matters, but the official judges are the ones that count? Or perhaps the presence of an official judge as a feature might be a clue. Wait, the features include "Offical judge (yes / no)", so perhaps for a given round, whether the judge is official or not affects their scoring. But how does that help in deciding who won the round? Maybe official judges have more weight, but the tree needs to split based on their presence. 

Alternatively, maybe the round number is important. For example, in later rounds, one boxer might dominate. Or maybe certain judges tend to favor one fighter. Let's think about the possible splits. 

Starting with the root node, which feature provides the most information gain? Let's think through each feature:

1. **Judge (E. Williams, L. O'Connell, etc.)**: There are 10 judges listed. Each judge might have a bias. For instance, if E. Williams tends to favor Lewis more often, that could be a split point. But with so many judges, splitting on each individually might not be efficient unless some judges are decisive.

2. **Official judge (yes/no)**: If a judge is official, their vote is part of the official scoring. But the question is about who won the round, so perhaps official judges are more reliable, but maybe the presence of official judges in the data is a key factor. Wait, but the feature "Offical judge (yes / no)" might indicate whether the judge in question is official. But each round would have multiple judges, so perhaps each judge's vote is a separate entry? The problem isn't entirely clear. Wait, the original example had features for each instance (each row is a flower with its features), so in this case, each row would be a round's evaluation by a judge, and the target is who won that round according to that judge? Or is each round's outcome determined by the majority of judges? Hmm, maybe the features are for each round, and the judges' votes are aggregated. Wait, perhaps the features are for a given round, and we have to determine the winner based on the judge's decision. But the problem states to classify which fighter won each round, so maybe each round has a winner, and the features (judge, official status, round) are used to predict that. Wait, that might not make sense because the same round would be evaluated by multiple judges. Maybe the data is structured as each instance is a judge's score for a particular round, and the target is who won that round according to the majority or official decision. Alternatively, perhaps each row is a round, and the features include the judges involved and their official status. This is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that for each round, there are multiple judges, each giving their vote. The decision tree needs to predict the winner based on the features of the judges and the round. But the target is the overall round winner, so maybe the model uses the judge's features to determine the likelihood of their vote, and then aggregates? But the user wants a decision tree based on the features given to classify the round's winner. 

Alternatively, maybe the features for each round are the presence of certain judges and the round number, and the decision tree uses those to decide the winner. But that's unclear. Let me try to proceed with the assumption that each instance (row) represents a round, with features like which judges were present (but the feature is categorical, so maybe encoded?), official judge presence (maybe yes if any official judge is present?), and the round number. 

Alternatively, perhaps each row is a judge's evaluation for a round, and the target is who that judge scored as the round winner. But then the decision tree would predict per judge's vote, which might not be the goal. The user wants the classifier to decide who won the round, so perhaps it's a majority vote, but the features help in determining that.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the problem statement.

The user says: "I want you to induce a decision tree classifier based on features. I first give an example below. Then, I provide you with Features and want you to build a decision tree using the most important features. The tree should classify which of the two boxing fighters (Lewis and Holyfield) won each the round."

The features given are Judge (one of several names), Official judge (yes/no), and Round (1 to 12). So each data point is a judge's vote for a round, and the target is who won that round. But how do we get the target? If the target is the actual round winner (determined by majority or official judges), then each round has one winner, but each judge's vote is a separate instance. Alternatively, maybe the target is the judge's vote (who they scored as the winner), but the user wants to predict the actual round winner, which might require aggregating judges' votes. But the problem states to build a decision tree to classify the round's winner, so perhaps the features are for a round, and the decision tree uses the judge features (maybe the presence of certain judges and their official status) along with the round number to decide the winner.

Alternatively, maybe the features are per round, with variables like which judges were official in that round, and the round number. But since the judge name is a feature, perhaps it's a list of judges for that round, but the way it's presented as a feature is categorical, so maybe it's a multilabel feature, but that's more complex. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplified, and for each round, there's one judge (selected from the list) with their official status and the round number, and the target is who won the round according to that judge. But then the tree would predict the judge's vote, which is the target. But the user wants to classify the round's actual winner, so perhaps it's the majority vote. 

This is a bit unclear, but perhaps I need to proceed with the given features and structure a decision tree that splits on these features to predict the winner. Let's assume that the decision tree is built on the features (judge name, official status, round) to predict the round's winner (Lewis or Holyfield). 

Now, to build the decision tree, I need to choose the best split at each node. The features are categorical except for round (which is numerical). 

Starting with the root node. The features are:

1. Judge: 10 possible categories. 
2. Official judge: binary (yes/no)
3. Round: 1-12 (continuous, but can be split at certain points).

The target is two classes: Lewis or Holyfield.

First, I need to decide which feature to split on first. Let's think of possible splits:

- Splitting on the judge: Each judge might have a bias. For example, if E. Williams tends to favor Lewis 80% of the time, then splitting on E. Williams would be a good split. But with 10 judges, that's a lot of splits, and maybe the information gain isn't high unless one judge is highly biased.

- Splitting on official judge: Maybe official judges are more reliable, so their votes are more predictive. If official judges mostly vote for one fighter, then splitting on whether it's an official judge could be useful.

- Round: Perhaps in later rounds, one fighter dominates. For example, if rounds after 8 are more likely to be won by Lewis, then splitting on round > 8 could be a good split.

Assuming that round number is the most important, let's suppose that in the middle rounds (say round 5-7), Holyfield might be stronger, while Lewis dominates in later rounds. Alternatively, maybe the round number isn't as critical as the judge's bias.

Alternatively, perhaps official judges are more likely to vote for one fighter. Suppose that official judges (yes) tend to favor Holyfield, while non-official ones favor Lewis. Then splitting on official judge would be first.

Alternatively, if a particular judge, like E. Williams, is known to favor Lewis, then splitting on the judge first.

Without data, I have to make assumptions. Let me think of a plausible structure.

Perhaps the first split is on the round number. Suppose that in rounds 1-6, Holyfield tends to win more, and in rounds 7-12, Lewis does. So the first split is Round <= 6.5 or something. 

Then, within those splits, maybe split on official judge status. For example, in the first split (rounds 1-6), if it's an official judge, then maybe Holyfield is more likely. But if not, maybe the result varies.

Alternatively, maybe the most important feature is the official judge status. Suppose that official judges are more consistent in their scoring. So splitting on official judge first: if yes, then maybe look at the judge's name or round, and if no, then also.

Alternatively, perhaps the judge name is the most important. For instance, if the judge is E. Williams, they might favor Lewis, while L. O'Connell favors Holyfield. But with 10 judges, that's a lot of splits. Maybe the decision tree would first split on judge, then within each judge, maybe split on round or official status.

Alternatively, since the example given for iris uses a numerical feature split first, maybe here the round (numerical) would be first.

Alternatively, maybe the official judge's votes are more critical. Let's say the first split is whether the judge is official. If yes, then the official judges' votes might lean towards one fighter. Suppose official judges often favor Holyfield, so if it's an official judge, then Holyfield. But that's a big assumption.

Alternatively, maybe the round number is key. Let's proceed under the assumption that the round is most important. Let's say the first split is Round <= 6. Then, in rounds 1-6, maybe Holyfield is more likely to win, and in 7-12, Lewis. But perhaps within those splits, the official status or the judge's name further refines it.

Alternatively, suppose that in the later rounds, official judges tend to score for Lewis, so after splitting on round, then split on official status.

Alternatively, let's think of the decision tree structure step by step.

Root node: Split on Round. Suppose the optimal split is at 7.5 (so rounds 1-7 vs 8-12). Let's say that in rounds 1-7, Holyfield won more rounds, and in 8-12, Lewis did. But maybe there's more nuance.

Alternatively, maybe in round 1, Holyfield is strong, but as rounds progress, Lewis gains. So the split on round could be at 5.5. 

Alternatively, let's make an educated guess. Suppose the first split is Round <= 8. If the round is 1-8, then split further. Suppose in rounds 1-8, the next split is on official judge status. Suppose official judges in rounds 1-8 tend to favor Holyfield, so if it's an official judge, then Holyfield. If not, maybe look at the judge's name. 

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the judge. For example, if the judge is E. Williams (assuming he favored Lewis), then Lewis is the prediction. But since there are 10 judges, that's a lot of splits, so maybe the tree would only split on a few key judges.

Alternatively, maybe the most important feature is the official judge status. Let's say that if a judge is official, their vote is more likely to go to Holyfield. So first split on official judge. Then, within official judges, maybe split on round. 

Alternatively, here's a possible decision tree structure:

First split on Round: for example, Round <= 6.5

- If yes (rounds 1-6): next split on official judge.

   - If official judge: maybe Holyfield is more likely.

   - If not official: split on judge's name, like E. Williams vs others.

Alternatively, maybe after round split, the next split is on the judge's name. 

Alternatively, here's a possible structure:

|--- Round <= 8.5

||--- class: Holyfield (if rounds 1-8, Holyfield wins more)

||--- Round > 8.5

|||--- Official judge == yes

||||--- class: Lewis (assuming official judges in later rounds favor Lewis)

||||--- Official judge == no

|||||--- class: Holyfield (non-official might be inconsistent)

But this is speculative. Alternatively, let's think that in the later rounds (like after round 8), Lewis is stronger, especially with official judges. 

Alternatively, perhaps the most important split is on the judge's name. For instance, if the judge is E. Williams, then Lewis wins. If it's L. O'Connell, Holyfield, etc. But with 10 judges, the tree might not split all, but maybe the first split is on one key judge, then others.

Alternatively, since the example given had a numerical split first, maybe here the round is first. Let me try to come up with a plausible tree.

Suppose the decision tree starts with Round. Let's say the first split is at Round <= 6.5. 

- Round <= 6.5 (rounds 1-6): then look at official judge. 

   - Official judge = yes: maybe Holyfield (assuming official judges favor him early)

   - Official judge = no: then look at judge's name. For example, if the judge is E. Williams (non-official), maybe Lewis wins, but others might vary.

But this is getting too nested. Alternatively, maybe after Round split, the next split is on official judge.

Alternatively, here's a possible structure:

Root: Round <= 6.5

|--- Yes (rounds 1-6)

||--- Official judge = yes

|||--- class: Holyfield

||--- Official judge = no

|||--- class: Lewis

|--- No (rounds 7-12)

||--- Official judge = yes

|||--- class: Lewis

||--- Official judge = no

|||--- class: Holyfield

This is simple, but maybe that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps in later rounds, official judges favor Lewis, so the splits would reflect that.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on official judge status.

Root: Official judge == yes

|--- Yes

||--- Round <= 8.5

|||--- class: Holyfield (if official and early rounds)

||--- Round > 8.5

|||--- class: Lewis (later rounds)

|--- No (non-official judges)

||--- Judge == E. Williams

|||--- class: Lewis

||--- Others

|||--- class: Holyfield (assuming other non-official judges are split)

But again, this is arbitrary without data.

Alternatively, considering that in the original example, the splits were on numerical features, maybe here the round is split numerically first. Let's go with that approach.

First split: Round <= 6.5

- If yes (rounds 1-6): next split on official judge.

   - Official yes: Holyfield

   - Official no: then maybe split on judge name. Let's say if the judge is E. Williams (non-official), then Lewis, else Holyfield.

But this requires more splits. Alternatively, maybe after Round <=6.5 and official yes, it's Holyfield; if official no, then split on judge's name. But with 10 judges, that's too many, so maybe the next split is another round feature? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the second split after Round <=6.5 is on the judge's name. Suppose that among non-official judges in early rounds, a particular judge tends to favor Lewis. 

Alternatively, maybe the most straightforward tree is:

Root: Round <= 8.5

|--- Yes (rounds 1-8): Holyfield

|--- No (rounds 9-12): Lewis

This is simple but ignores other features, which might not be optimal.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Official judge == yes

|--- Yes (official judge)

||--- Round <= 7.5

|||--- class: Holyfield (official judges in early rounds favor him)

||--- Round >7.5

|||--- class: Lewis (official in later rounds favor Lewis)

|--- No (non-official)

||--- Judge is E. Williams: Lewis

||--- Else: Holyfield

This uses the judge's name for non-official.

Alternatively, since the problem requires using the most important features, perhaps the round and official status are key, with judge name as a tertiary feature.

Alternatively, the most important feature is the round, then official, then judge.

Putting it all together, here's a possible decision tree structure:

The root splits on Round:

- If Round <= 6.5:

   Then split on Official judge:

      - Yes: Holyfield

      - No: Split on Judge (e.g., if Judge is E. Williams, Lewis, else Holyfield)

- Else (Round 7-12):

   Split on Official judge:

      - Yes: Lewis

      - No: Holyfield (assuming non-official might be inconsistent)

Alternatively, but it's getting complex. Maybe a simpler tree without nesting too much.

Alternatively, considering the example uses a single split on a numerical feature, perhaps here the first split is Round <=8, then the next splits on Official judge.

Final guess:

|--- Round <= 8

||--- class: Holyfield (if round is 1-8)

|--- Round >8

||--- Official judge == yes

|||--- class: Lewis

||--- Official judge == no

|||--- class: Holyfield

This way, in rounds 9-12, official judges go to Lewis, but non-official might still favor Holyfield.

Alternatively, maybe in rounds above 8, Lewis wins regardless of judge type. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on official judge:

Root: Official judge == yes

|--- Yes

||--- Round <= 8.5 --> Holyfield

||--- Round >8.5 --> Lewis

|--- No

||--- Judge == E. Williams --> Lewis

||--- Others --> Holyfield

This uses the judge's name for non-official judges.

Since the problem says "most important features", and considering that in fights, later rounds often see a stronger performance from a fighter, maybe the round is first, then official judge.

So I'll structure it as:

Root split on Round <= 7.5

- If yes (rounds 1-7): Holyfield

- If no (rounds 8-12): then split on Official judge:

   - Yes --> Lewis

   - No --> Holyfield (assuming non-official might not be as decisive)

Alternatively, maybe in rounds 8-12, official judges favor Lewis, non-official might still have Holyfield.

Thus the tree would be:

|--- Round <= 7.5

||--- class: Holyfield

|--- Round >7.5

||--- Official judge == yes

|||--- class: Lewis

||--- Official judge == no

|||--- class: Holyfield

This way, only in rounds 8-12 with official judges does Lewis win.

Alternatively, maybe non-official judges in later rounds also favor Lewis, making it:

|--- Round >7.5

||--- class: Lewis

But that ignores official status. 

Alternatively, the most straightforward is:

First split on round. Suppose in rounds 1-8, Holyfield, else Lewis. That's simple but maybe not using other features. Since the question says "most important features", perhaps round and official status are key.

Finalizing a plausible tree:

|--- Round <= 6.5

||--- class: Holyfield

|--- Round >6.5

||--- Official judge == yes

|||--- class: Lewis

||--- Official judge == no

|||--- class: Holyfield

This suggests that in rounds 7-12, official judges lean towards Lewis, but non-official still favor Holyfield.

Alternatively, maybe in rounds 7-12, regardless of judge, Lewis wins. But to incorporate features, include official status.

Alternatively, here's another structure:

|--- Round <= 8

||--- Official judge == yes

|||--- class: Holyfield

||--- Official judge == no

|||--- class: Lewis

|--- Round >8

||--- Official judge == yes

|||--- class: Lewis

||--- Official judge == no

|||--- class: Holyfield

This alternates based on round and official status.

But without data, it's speculative. Given the need to provide an answer, I'll go with a structure that first splits on Round, then on Official judge, then possibly on Judge name if needed, but keep it simple.

Final answer:

The decision tree might look like this, assuming important features are Round first, then Official judge status:

|--- Round <= 8.5

||--- class: Holyfield (early rounds favor Holyfield)

|--- Round >8.5

||--- Official judge == yes

|||--- class: Lewis (official judges favor Lewis in later rounds)

||--- Official judge == no

|||--- class: Holyfield (non-official might still favor Holyfield)

Alternatively, perhaps in later rounds, even non-officials go for Lewis, making it:

|--- Round >8.5

||--- class: Lewis

But to use the official feature, the previous structure is better.

Alternatively, here's a more detailed one:

|--- Round <= 6.5

||--- class: Holyfield

|--- Round >6.5

||--- Official judge == yes

|||--- class: Lewis

||--- Official judge == no

|||--- class: Holyfield

This splits at 6.5, so rounds 7-12 with official judges go to Lewis.

This is a plausible structure, so I'll present this.



#########################


<think>
Okay, I need to create a Python function based on the given decision tree structure for predicting which fighter won a boxing round. The user provided the features and their encodings, so I should start by understanding each feature's possible values.

The features are:
- 'Judge' with codes 0-9 representing different judges.
- 'Official' is a binary (1 for yes, 0 for no) indicating if the judge is official.
- 'Round' ranges from 1 to 12.
- The target is 'target' which is 1 for Lewis and 0 for Holyfield.

The example function shows a structure with nodes and conditions. The user wants a similar structure where each node's condition is checked, and the path through the tree determines the prediction. Also, the nodes list should have 1s or 0s based on whether each condition was met.

Hmm, but wait, the user didn't provide the actual decision tree structure. The problem description starts with "Now, format this decision tree..." implying that the previous information (the features, target, etc.) is all I have, but the actual decision tree's structure and thresholds are missing. The example shows a function with specific conditions, so maybe the user expects me to create a plausible decision tree based on the features given, filling in thresholds where needed?

Alternatively, maybe the initial part of the query included a decision tree diagram that I can't see here. Wait, looking back, the user's message seems to start with the instruction to format the decision tree into a Python function, but the actual tree's structure isn't provided. That's confusing. Since the example uses a function with nodes and conditions, perhaps the assistant is supposed to assume a hypothetical decision tree structure based on the features?

Wait, the user might have missed including the actual decision tree structure in their message. But given that they provided the features and an example, maybe I need to create a sample decision tree based on common sense. For example, maybe the decision tree first checks the judge, then the round, then official status, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the features provided and come up with a plausible decision tree. Since the user mentioned "fill placeholders with meaningful values", I need to make reasonable guesses for thresholds.

Let me think of possible splits. The target is predicting whether Lewis (1) or Holyfield (0) won the round. Let's imagine the decision tree structure.

First, maybe the first split is based on the judge. For example, if the judge is HBO-Lederman (code 3), then maybe the result leans towards Lewis. But I need to make up some thresholds here.

Alternatively, the first node might be something like 'Round' less than a certain value. Let's say, if the round is less than 7, then check another feature. Or 'Official' being 1 could be a condition.

Alternatively, considering that in boxing, official judges might have different criteria. Let me try to create a simple tree.

Let me structure the nodes step by step.

Suppose the first node is whether the judge is S. Christodoulu (code 2). So node[0] = (X['Judge'] == 2). Then, if yes, maybe check the round number. If the round is greater than 8, then predict 1 (Lewis). Otherwise, maybe check official status.

Alternatively, another approach: the first split is on the round. Let's say if the round is <=6, go left, else right. Then, maybe next split on judge being official.

Alternatively, perhaps the first node is the Official status: if it's an official judge (1), then proceed to check another feature, else another path.

Wait, but since I have to make up the tree, I need to pick some splits that make sense. Let me try to outline a possible decision tree structure:

Let's say:

- Node 0: If Judge is HBO-Lederman (3) → then check another condition. Else, go to another path.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on the Round. Suppose:

Node[0]: Round <= 6 → if yes, then next node checks Official status.

Node[1]: If Official is 1 (Yes), then predict Holyfield (0).

Else, maybe check another feature like the Judge's code.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is based on the Judge. Let's pick a threshold here. Suppose the first split is Judge being less than 5. So node0: Judge < 5 → then proceed.

Wait, since the example function uses a list of nodes with conditions, perhaps the tree depth is manageable. Let's assume a small tree.

Let me try to come up with a plausible structure. Let's say:

The first node (nodes[0]) checks if the Round is less than or equal to 6. If yes, then proceed to node1, else node2.

Node1: checks if the Official is 1 (Yes). If yes, then predict 0 (Holyfield). Else, check another node.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to structure it step by step as per the example.

Alternatively, here's a possible structure (hypothetical):

nodes[0] = (X['Official'] == 1)  # is it an official judge?

If yes (nodes[0] is True), then go to node1 which could be based on the Round.

nodes[1] = (X['Round'] > 8)  # if round is above 8.

If that's true, then maybe node2: check the judge's code. Like nodes[2] = (X['Judge'] < 3). 

But I'm just making this up. Alternatively, perhaps the first node is Round <= 6 → then predict 0 (Holyfield). Else, check if the judge is official.

Alternatively, let's try to build the function as per the example's structure, using the given features.

Wait, perhaps I need to use the features given, so the nodes will be conditions on 'Judge', 'Official', and 'Round'.

Let me think of the example function given. The example had nodes[0] to nodes[4], and the conditions used features like petal_length, etc. So in this case, the features are Judge (categorical), Official (binary), Round (1-12).

So, in the function, nodes will be conditions on these variables.

Let me try to create a simple decision tree structure.

Suppose the first split is on the Official judge. nodes[0] = (X['Official'] == 1)

If it's an official judge, then proceed to check the Round. nodes[1] = (X['Round'] > 8) → if Round is in later rounds, maybe Lewis won more?

Else, if not official, check the Judge's code. nodes[2] = (X['Judge'] >= 5) → perhaps certain judges favor Lewis.

Wait, but how to structure this into a function with nested ifs and nodes array?

Alternatively, here's a possible decision tree structure:

nodes[0] = (X['Official'] == 1)  # is the judge official?

If nodes[0] is True (official), then check Round:

nodes[1] = (X['Round'] > 8)

If nodes[1] is True, then predict 1 (Lewis). Else, check Judge's code:

nodes[2] = (X['Judge'] >= 3) → suppose if the judge is HBO-Lederman (3) or higher, then maybe predict 0.

Wait, but I need to make it so that each condition in the nodes list is evaluated, and the path through the tree is determined by those.

Alternatively, let's structure the nodes as follows:

nodes[0] = (X['Round'] <= 6)  # first split on round.

If nodes[0] is True, then next check Official:

nodes[1] = (X['Official'] == 0)  # not official.

If nodes[1] is True → predict 0 (Holyfield). Else, maybe another condition.

Alternatively, maybe the first node is based on the Judge. Let's pick a threshold for Judge. Suppose:

nodes[0] = (X['Judge'] < 5) → if judge is in first 5 (E. Williams up to Sportsticker)

Then, if that's true, check the Round.

nodes[1] = (X['Round'] > 8) → if yes, predict 1.

Else, check Official.

Hmm, but I'm just making this up. Since the user hasn't provided the actual tree structure, I need to make one that's plausible and uses the features.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on the Round being less than 7, then if yes, check the Official status, else check the Judge.

Alternatively, let's think of a simple tree:

The decision tree could be:

Start with Official:

If Official is 1 (Yes), then check Round.

If Round > 8 → predict Lewis (1).

Else, check Judge: if Judge is 3 (HBO-Lederman), predict 0, else 1.

Wait, but how to structure this into the nodes array and the function.

Alternatively, the nodes array would have:

nodes[0] = (X['Official'] == 1)

nodes[1] = (X['Round'] > 8)

nodes[2] = (X['Judge'] == 3)

Then, the logic would be something like:

if nodes[0]:

    if nodes[1]:

        prediction = 1

    else:

        if nodes[2]:

            prediction = 0

        else:

            prediction = 1

else:

    ... (some other conditions)

But this is just a guess. Since the user's example has 5 nodes, maybe our function should have 5 nodes as well.

Alternatively, I can structure it with 5 conditions.

Another approach: perhaps the tree is structured as follows:

nodes[0] = (X['Round'] <= 6)

If yes (nodes[0] is True):

    nodes[1] = (X['Official'] == 1)

    if nodes[1]:

        prediction 0 (Holyfield)

    else:

        nodes[2] = (X['Judge'] >= 5)

        if nodes[2]:

            prediction 1 (Lewis)

        else:

            prediction 0

Else (Round >6):

    nodes[3] = (X['Judge'] < 3)

    if nodes[3]:

        prediction 1

    else:

        nodes[4] = (X['Official'] == 0)

        if nodes[4]:

            prediction 0

        else:

            prediction 1

This uses 5 nodes. Let's see:

nodes[0] = Round <=6

nodes[1] = Official is 1

nodes[2] = Judge >=5

nodes[3] = Judge <3

nodes[4] = Official ==0

Wait, but nodes[4] would be checked only in the else part of nodes[3], which may not be necessary. But to make it work with 5 nodes, perhaps this structure.

Then the code would be:

def predict(X: dict):

    nodes = [None]*5

    nodes[0] = (X['Round'] <=6)

    nodes[1] = (X['Official'] ==1)

    nodes[2] = (X['Judge'] >=5)

    nodes[3] = (X['Judge'] <3)

    nodes[4] = (X['Official'] ==0)

    if nodes[0]:

        if nodes[1]:

            prediction = 0

        else:

            if nodes[2]:

                prediction =1

            else:

                prediction=0

    else:

        if nodes[3]:

            prediction=1

        else:

            if nodes[4]:

                prediction=0

            else:

                prediction=1

    return prediction, nodes

This is one possible structure. But perhaps there are better ways. Alternatively, maybe the first split is based on the judge being HBO-Lederman (code 3). 

Alternatively, maybe the first node is whether the official is 1. Let's try another structure.

Another option:

nodes[0] = (X['Official'] ==1)

nodes[1] = (X['Round']>8)

nodes[2] = (X['Judge'] ==3)

nodes[3] = (X['Round']<=4)

nodes[4] = (X['Judge'] <5)

Then:

if nodes[0]:

    if nodes[1]:

        if nodes[2]:

            predict 0

        else:

            predict 1

    else:

        if nodes[3]:

            predict 0

        else:

            predict 1

else:

    if nodes[4]:

        predict 1

    else:

        predict 0

This might use all 5 nodes. But I'm not sure. The key is to make sure each node is part of the path through the tree, and the nodes list captures all conditions checked along the way.

Alternatively, the example given in the problem uses a more complex structure, so perhaps the nodes are checked in a way that not all are necessarily used, but they are stored in the list. So even if a node isn't used in a particular path, its value is still 0 or 1 depending on the condition.

Wait, but the nodes list should be filled with 1 if the condition is met, else 0 for each node in the tree, regardless of whether that node was on the path taken. Wait no, the example shows that nodes are set to the condition's boolean value, but in the example code, all nodes are assigned values first, then the conditionals are checked. So in the example, all nodes are evaluated upfront, and the list is filled with all conditions' truth values. Wait, looking at the example code:

nodes[0] = X["petal_length"] <= 2.5

nodes[1] = X["sepal_width"] > 3.1

etc. So all nodes are evaluated first, regardless of the path. The nodes list is just a list of all the conditions in the tree (each node's condition), and each entry is 1 (True) or 0 (False) based on whether the condition was true for the given X. The code then uses the conditions in the if-else structure, but the nodes list is just the list of all conditions' booleans, even if some are not on the path taken.

Ah, that's important. So in the function, all the nodes' conditions are evaluated first, stored in the nodes list (as booleans, but in the example, they are stored as boolean values, but in Python, the function returns them as 1 or 0? Wait, no, in the example, the nodes are assigned as booleans (True/False), but the problem says "the nodes list should be filled with 1 or 0", but in Python, the code would have to cast them to integers. Wait, looking at the example code:

In the problem's example, the nodes are assigned as boolean expressions, but the problem says "the nodes list should be filled with 1 or 0". So maybe in the function, each node is stored as an integer 1 or 0, so:

nodes[0] = 1 if (X['Round'] <=6) else 0

But in the code, the example uses boolean expressions, but then in the problem statement, it might require converting them to 1/0. Wait, the problem's example code uses booleans in the nodes list, but the user instruction says "the nodes list should be filled with 1 or 0". So perhaps in the function, each node is an integer 1 or 0.

Wait, looking at the example given in the problem's user message:

In the example code provided by the user:

def predict(X: dict):

    nodes = [None] *5

    nodes[0] = X["petal_length"] <= 2.5

    nodes[1] = X["sepal_width"] > 3.1

    etc...

    return prediction, nodes

But the problem says "the nodes list should be filled with 1 or 0", so perhaps the code should cast the boolean to integers, so:

nodes[0] = 1 if (X["petal_length"] <= 2.5) else 0

Wait, but in the example code given by the user in the problem statement, they didn't do that. Maybe the problem allows booleans, but the user instruction says to use 1/0. So perhaps in our code, we should cast to integers.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the nodes to be booleans. However, in the problem's example, the nodes are assigned as boolean expressions, so maybe we can follow that.

But to adhere to the user's instruction, which says "the nodes list should be filled with 1 or 0", so perhaps we need to convert each condition to an integer (1 for True, 0 for False).

So in the code, each node assignment would be:

nodes[0] = int(X["petal_length"] <= 2.5)

So, in our code, each node is assigned an integer 1 or 0.

Therefore, in our function, we need to structure the nodes list with all the conditions in the decision tree, evaluated and stored as 1 or 0, and then the prediction is computed using those nodes.

The structure of the decision tree will determine how many nodes there are and their conditions.

Since the example has 5 nodes, maybe the user expects a similar structure with a few nodes. So let's try to create a plausible decision tree with 5 nodes.

Let me think of a simple decision tree for predicting whether the target is 0 or 1 based on the features Judge (categorical, 0-?), Official (binary 0/1), and Round (1-12).

Suppose the decision tree is as follows:

1. Node 0: Is Round <=6?

   - Yes (node0=1):

      2. Node1: Is Official==1?

          - Yes (node1=1):

              predict 0 (Holyfield)

          - No (node1=0):

              3. Node2: Is Judge >=5?

                  - Yes (node2=1): predict 1 (Lewis)

                  - No (node2=0): predict 0

   - No (node0=0):

      4. Node3: Is Judge <3?

          - Yes (node3=1): predict 1

          - No (node3=0):

              5. Node4: Is Official==0?

                  - Yes (node4=1): predict 0

                  - No (node4=0): predict 1

This uses 5 nodes.

So the code would be:

def predict(X: dict):

    nodes = [0]*5

    nodes[0] = 1 if (X['Round'] <=6) else 0

    nodes[1] = 1 if (X['Official'] ==1) else 0

    nodes[2] = 1 if (X['Judge'] >=5) else 0

    nodes[3] = 1 if (X['Judge'] <3) else 0

    nodes[4] = 1 if (X['Official'] ==0) else 0

    if nodes[0]:

        if nodes[1]:

            prediction =0

        else:

            if nodes[2]:

                prediction=1

            else:

                prediction=0

    else:

        if nodes[3]:

            prediction=1

        else:

            if nodes[4]:

                prediction=0

            else:

                prediction=1

    return prediction, nodes

This is one possible implementation.

Alternatively, the nodes could be structured differently, but this is an example. The important part is that the nodes list contains the evaluations of each condition in the tree, and the prediction is computed based on the conditions.

Another possible structure could be:

Node0: Official ==1

Node1: Round >8

Node2: Judge ==3

Node3: Round <=4

Node4: Judge <5

Then:

if node0:

    if node1:

        if node2:

            predict 0

        else:

            predict 1

    else:

        if node3:

            predict 0

        else:

            predict 1

else:

    if node4:

        predict 1

    else:

        predict0

But again, this is just another possibility.

The key is to create a plausible decision tree using the given features, assign each node's condition, evaluate them all first, then compute the prediction based on the path through the nodes.

Since the problem doesn't specify the tree structure, any valid structure that uses the features and results in a prediction is acceptable. 

Given that, the above examples should work, but to ensure that all nodes are part of the decision path, the code must evaluate all nodes, even if they aren't on the current path.

Wait, no. The nodes list should contain all the conditions in the decision tree, even if some conditions are not on the path taken. For instance, in the first example I made, all 5 nodes are evaluated and stored in the nodes list, even if in a particular path, some nodes are not used. 

Therefore, the code must first evaluate all nodes, then use the conditions in the if-else structure to compute the prediction.

Thus, the code structure as above is correct.
