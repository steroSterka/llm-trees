<think>

Okay, so the user wants me to create a decision tree classifier to determine which fighter, Lewis or Holyfield, won a round based on the given features. The features provided are Judge (with several options), Official Judge (yes/no), and Round (1 to 12). 

First, I need to recall how decision trees work. They split the data based on feature values to make classifications. The splits are chosen based on some criteria like information gain, Gini impurity, etc. Since the user provided an example with the iris dataset, which uses thresholds for continuous features and categories for discrete ones, I should follow a similar structure.

Let me think about the features here. The Judge is categorical with multiple options. Official Judge is a binary feature (yes/no), and Round is a numerical feature from 1 to 12. The target variable is the fighter who won the round (Lewis or Holyfield). 

The challenge is to structure the tree using these features. The example given for the iris dataset uses numerical splits like petal width <= 0.80, so for the Round, I can set thresholds like Round <= X. For the categorical features like Judge or Official Judge, splits would be based on specific categories or the binary value.

But wait, the Judges have multiple values. How do I handle that in a decision tree? For each categorical feature, the decision tree can split on individual categories or groups. But since there are multiple judges, maybe the most important splits come from certain judges having a tendency to favor one fighter over another. For example, maybe a particular judge consistently scores more rounds for Lewis, so the tree might split on that judge's entries first.

However, without actual data, I need to make assumptions here. The user probably expects a plausible structure based on typical boxing judge behavior. Official Judges are those whose scores count towards the final decision, so maybe rounds scored by official judges are more critical. Alternatively, maybe non-official judges might have different patterns.

Starting with the most important feature. Since the example used petal width first, perhaps the Round is a key feature here. Maybe the outcome varies by round, with fighters having different strategies in early vs. later rounds. For instance, maybe Lewis does better in later rounds.

Alternatively, the Judge could be the first split. Suppose a particular judge, say E. Williams, tends to favor Holyfield, so the first split could be: if the judge is E. Williams, then maybe Holyfield is more likely to win that round. But without data, it's tricky. Maybe the official judge status is important. If it's an official judge, their scoring might be more accurate, so splits on official judges could be crucial.

Alternatively, the Round might be more significant. Let's think step by step:

First, maybe the Round number. Let's say if the round is early (like 1-4), maybe Holyfield is stronger, but in later rounds, Lewis dominates. So the first split could be Round <= 6. Then, depending on that, further splits on judges or official status.

Alternatively, the Official Judge status. Suppose official judges are more likely to split rounds differently. Maybe official judges give more points to Lewis in later rounds. Or maybe non-official judges have different tendencies.

Alternatively, the Judge's name: perhaps certain judges have a bias. For example, if the judge is HBO-Lederman, maybe they have a history of favoring Lewis. So the first split could be on Judge being HBO-Lederman, leading to Lewis's win.

But since the user provided multiple judges, perhaps the first split is on whether the judge is an official one. Let me structure the tree step by step:

Root node: Maybe split on Official Judge first. If it's an official judge, then further splits. Suppose official judges are more reliable, so their scores are more decisive. Let's say:

|--- Official Judge = yes
||--- Then maybe split on Round. For example, if Round <= 6, then Holyfield, else Lewis.

But then, what if it's not official? Maybe non-official judges have different patterns. Alternatively, the Round could be the first split.

Alternatively, the most critical feature might be the Round. Let's try:

First split on Round. Suppose if Round is 1-6, Holyfield tends to win more rounds here, but 7-12 Lewis gains momentum. So:

|--- Round <= 6
||--- Then maybe split on Judge or Official status.

Alternatively, the first split is on Round <= 8. Then, if yes, check another feature.

Alternatively, perhaps the Judge is the first split. Let's see:

Suppose the most important judge is E. Williams. So:

|--- Judge = E. Williams
||--- Then maybe Holyfield wins, as he's favored by that judge.

But maybe E. Williams is an official judge? Not sure. Alternatively, the first split could be on a specific judge's name, then official status, then round.

Alternatively, perhaps the best way is to start with the Official Judge, then Round, then Judge. Let me try building a plausible tree.

Wait, the example given for the iris used a numerical feature first (petal width). Since Round is numerical here, maybe start with Round. Let's try:

First split on Round <= 6. If yes, then maybe split on Official Judge. Suppose in rounds 1-6, if official, then Holyfield, else maybe Lewis. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that official judges in later rounds favor Lewis. Let me think of a possible structure:

Start with Round. Suppose:

|--- Round <= 8
||--- Then check if it's an official judge. If yes, maybe Holyfield wins here.
|||--- Official Judge = yes -> Holyfield
|||--- Official Judge = no -> Maybe Lewis
|--- Round >8
||--- Then, perhaps the official judge's decision goes to Lewis.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is Official Judge = yes. If official, then split on Round. If non-official, split on judge name.

But without knowing the data, this is challenging. Maybe the user expects a structure similar to the example, using the features in a logical order. Let's try:

First split on Round. Let's say if Round is 1-6, then split on Official Judge. Suppose in early rounds, official judges give more rounds to Holyfield. If Round is 7-12, maybe Lewis gains. Or the other way around.

Alternatively, the key might be that in the later rounds, official judges favor Lewis. Let's try:

Start with Round:

|--- Round <= 6
||--- Then split on Official Judge:
|||--- Official Judge = yes -> Holyfield
|||--- Official Judge = no -> Maybe split on a judge, like if HBO-Lederman, then Lewis?

Alternatively, maybe the first split is Official Judge = yes. Then:

|--- Official Judge = yes
||--- Then split on Round:
|||--- Round <= 8 -> Holyfield
|||--- Round >8 -> Lewis
|--- Official Judge = no
||--- Then split on Judge. For example, if Judge is HBO-Lederman, then Lewis, else maybe Holyfield.

Alternatively, the first split could be on a specific judge, like HBO-Lederman, who is an official judge. But this requires knowing which judges are official.

Alternatively, the user might expect that the most important feature is the Official Judge status, as it directly relates to the decision's validity. Then, within that, the round or judge name.

Alternatively, maybe the Round is the most important, so first split on Round, then Official Judge, then Judge.

Hmm. The example given for the iris uses a single feature first, then splits further. Maybe here the first split is on Round, say Round <= 6. Then, for each branch, split on Official Judge, then perhaps another feature.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on whether the judge is an official one. Suppose official judges are more accurate, so their rounds are split based on round number, while non-official have different.

Let me try to draft a possible tree step by step:

Root node: Official Judge (yes/no)

If yes (Official):

Then split on Round. Suppose in early rounds (<=6), Holyfield wins, later rounds (7-12) Lewis.

So:

|--- Official Judge = yes
||--- Round <=6
|||--- class: Holyfield
||--- Round >6
|||--- class: Lewis

If not official (Non-official):

Then maybe split on a specific judge. For example, among non-official judges, if the judge is HBO-Lederman, then maybe Lewis is favored, else Holyfield.

Wait, but there are multiple judges. Alternatively, split on Round again, but with different thresholds.

Alternatively, non-official judges might have a different pattern. Suppose non-official judges give more rounds to Lewis in the early rounds.

So:

|--- Official Judge = no
||--- Round <=4
|||--- class: Lewis
||--- Round >4
|||--- class: Holyfield

But this is arbitrary. Alternatively, maybe non-official judges have a split based on another feature.

Alternatively, the first split is on Round, then Official Judge, then Judge.

Alternatively, here's another approach. Since the example uses a single feature at each split, maybe the tree would look like:

First split on Round. Let's say Round <= 6.

If yes:

Then split on Official Judge. Suppose if official, Holyfield; else, maybe Lewis.

If Round >6:

Split on Official Judge again, but maybe here if official, Lewis; else, split on judge.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Judge being a certain person, say HBO-Lederman (assuming they are an official judge). 

Alternatively, since there are multiple judges, perhaps the key is that certain judges have a bias. For example, if the judge is E. Williams, maybe Holyfield wins, while other judges favor Lewis. 

This is getting a bit too speculative. Since the user wants the most important features, perhaps the key features are Official Judge and Round. The Judge's name might be less important but included in splits.

Alternatively, here's a possible structure:

Start with Round:

|--- Round <= 6
||--- Official Judge = yes
|||--- class: Holyfield
||--- Official Judge = no
|||--- class: Lewis
|--- Round >6
||--- Official Judge = yes
|||--- class: Lewis
||--- Official Judge = no
|||--- class: Holyfield

But this is just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the first split is Official Judge, then Round.

Another approach: The most important feature is the Official Judge, because the official judges' scoring is what matters most, so their rounds are split based on the round number. Non-official judges might have different patterns.

Alternatively, suppose that official judges tend to score Lewis higher in later rounds. So:

|--- Official Judge = yes
||--- Round <=8
|||--- Holyfield
||--- Round >8
|||--- Lewis
|--- Official Judge = no
||--- Split on a specific judge like HBO-Lederman:
|||--- Judge = HBO-Lederman
||||--- Lewis
|||--- Else
||||--- Holyfield

But without data, this is just an assumption. The user might expect that the decision tree uses the most impactful features first, so perhaps Round and Official Judge are the top features.

Alternatively, the first split could be on whether the judge is an official one. If yes, then split by Round. If not, split by another feature like Judge.

Alternatively, here's a possible tree structure:

Start with Official Judge:

|--- Official Judge = yes
||--- Round <= 8
|||--- class: Holyfield
||--- Round >8
|||--- class: Lewis
|--- Official Judge = no
||--- Judge is HBO-Lederman
|||--- class: Lewis
||--- Judge is not HBO-Lederman
||||--- Round <=6
|||||--- class: Holyfield
||||--- Round >6
|||||--- class: Lewis

This way, official judges split based on round, non-officials first check if the judge is HBO-Lederman, then round. But this is just a plausible path.

Alternatively, maybe Round is the first split. Let's say:

|--- Round <=6
||--- Official Judge = yes -> Holyfield
||--- Official Judge = no -> Split on Judge, maybe E. Williams: if yes, Holyfield else Lewis
|--- Round >6
||--- Official Judge = yes -> Lewis
||--- Official Judge = no -> Split on another judge.

This is getting complex. Since the example uses a simple threshold and then subsequent splits, perhaps the first split is Round, then Official Judge, then another feature.

Alternatively, the most straightforward tree could be:

First split on Official Judge:

- If yes, split on Round (e.g., if Round >6 -> Lewis else Holyfield)

- If no, split on Judge (e.g., if a specific judge -> Lewis else Holyfield)

But to keep it simple like the example, maybe:

The first split is Round <= 6:

- If yes, check Official Judge:

   - If yes, Holyfield

   - If no, Lewis

- If Round >6:

   - Check Official Judge:

      - If yes, Lewis

      - If no, Holyfield

Alternatively, that's a possible structure. But I need to ensure it's a decision tree with branches.

Alternatively:

|--- Round <= 6

||--- Official Judge = yes

|||--- class: Holyfield

||--- Official Judge = no

|||--- class: Lewis

|--- Round >6

||--- Official Judge = yes

|||--- class: Lewis

||--- Official Judge = no

|||--- class: Holyfield

This structure uses Round first, then Official Judge. It splits the rounds into early and late, then checks if official, assigning the winner accordingly.

Alternatively, maybe the non-official judges have the opposite pattern. But this might be the simplest way.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that official judges in later rounds favor Lewis, so the tree could be structured as above.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is on Official Judge, then Round.

So:

|--- Official Judge = yes

||--- Round <=8

|||--- Holyfield

||--- Round >8

|||--- Lewis

|--- Official Judge = no

||--- Round <=4

|||--- Lewis

||--- Round >4

|||--- Holyfield

This way, official judges split on round, non-official have different splits.

But without data, it's hard to know. The user might expect a structure similar to the example, using the features in a logical order, perhaps starting with Round as it's numerical, then Official Judge, then Judge.

Alternatively, the most important feature could be the Judge's name. For instance, if the judge is E. Williams (assuming he's a Holyfield favorite), then Holyfield wins. Otherwise, split on other features.

But the example used a numerical feature first, so maybe Round is first here.

After considering various possibilities, I'll go with a structure that first splits on Round, then Official Judge, then maybe another feature. Let's try:

Root node: Round <= 6

If yes:

- Then check Official Judge:

   - If yes → Holyfield

   - If no → Lewis

If Round >6:

- Check Official Judge:

   - If yes → Lewis

   - If no → Holyfield

This way, the tree uses Round as the first split, then Official Judge, leading to the classification. It's a simple structure, similar to the example given, using the most important features first (Round and then Official Judge).

Alternatively, maybe include Judge in a deeper split. For example, after Round and Official Judge, if there's still a split needed, but since the problem states to classify between two fighters, perhaps the tree can be resolved with two levels.

Alternatively, maybe the first split is Official Judge = yes, then split on Round.

Like:

|--- Official Judge = yes

||--- Round <=8 → Holyfield

||--- Round >8 → Lewis

|--- Official Judge = no

||--- Judge is HBO-Lederman → Lewis

||--- Else → Holyfield

This incorporates Judge as a third-level split for non-official judges. But maybe that's too specific.

Given the example provided used three levels for the iris with three splits, maybe here we can have a tree that first splits on Round, then Official Judge, then perhaps another feature. But since the target is binary, maybe it can be resolved with two splits.

Alternatively, the simplest plausible tree based on the features and the example would be:

Start with Round:

If Round is <= 6:

   If Official Judge is Yes → Holyfield

   Else → Lewis

Else (Round >6):

   If Official Judge is Yes → Lewis

   Else → Holyfield

This structure uses Round and Official Judge as the main features, splitting the rounds into early and late, then checking official status. This seems logical and follows the example's style.
</think>

Decision Tree:

|--- Round <= 6  
||--- Official Judge = yes  
|||--- class: Holyfield  
||--- Official Judge = no  
|||--- class: Lewis  
|--- Round >6  
||--- Official Judge = yes  
|||--- class: Lewis  
||--- Official Judge = no  
|||--- class: Holyfield

### Explanation:  
This tree assumes:  
1. **Early rounds (1-6):**  
   - **Official judges** favor **Holyfield** (e.g., due to his style being more conservative or strategic in the opening rounds).  
   - **Non-official judges** might lean toward **Lewis** (e.g., favoring aggression from Lewis in early rounds).  

2. **Later rounds (7-12):**  
   - **Official judges** favor **Lewis** (e.g., Lewis gains momentum and dominates in later rounds).  
   - **Non-official judges** revert to **Holyfield** (e.g., non-official judges may prioritize technical precision, which Holyfield maintained consistently).  

This structure prioritizes the **Round** (numerical) and **Official Judge** (categorical) as the most impactful features, mirroring the structure of the iris example provided.

<think>
Okay, I need to create a Python function based on the provided decision tree structure. The user mentioned that the example given uses a decision tree with certain conditions, and I need to adapt that structure to the specific features provided for the boxing problem.

First, let me understand the features again. The features are 'Judge', 'Official', 'Round', and the target is 'target'. The target variable is which fighter won the round (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield). The features have specific encodings:

- Judge: 0 to 9, each representing different judges.
- Official: 1 for Yes, 0 for No.
- Round: 1 to 12.

The example function uses a list called nodes, which tracks the truth values of each inner node's condition. The prediction is determined by following the path through the tree based on these conditions.

Wait, the user didn't provide the actual decision tree structure, just the example. Hmm, maybe the user expects me to create a plausible decision tree for the given features? Since the problem says "format this decision tree as a Python function" but the actual tree isn't provided. Wait, maybe I misread the original problem. Let me check again.

Looking back: The user starts by asking to format the decision tree as a Python function. The initial part seems to be a setup where they provided the features and example code, but the actual decision tree structure isn't explicitly given. Oh, perhaps the user forgot to include the decision tree structure here? Because otherwise, how can I create the function without knowing the tree's conditions?

Wait, maybe the user is expecting me to generate a plausible decision tree based on the features? That might be the case. Since the example given is for a diabetes prediction, but the problem here is about boxing rounds. Since the user didn't provide the actual tree, perhaps I need to make some assumptions about how the decision tree might split the data.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants me to consider that the example code is part of their problem, but in their actual problem statement, the tree structure isn't present. That's confusing. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user is providing a generic structure, and wants the code written based on the features given. Let me re-read the problem again:

"Format this decision tree as a Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The entries of this list should be 1 if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, and 0 otherwise. If your decision tree has placeholders for thresholds, try to fill them with meaningful values."

But where is the decision tree? The user provided the features, their encodings, target variable, and an example function. Wait, perhaps the decision tree is supposed to be inferred from the features? Or maybe there was a mistake in the problem statement, and the actual tree was supposed to be included but it's missing here.

Hmm, this is a problem. Since without knowing the specific splits (like which feature is split at which threshold), I can't write the exact conditions for the nodes. The user might have intended to provide a decision tree diagram or structure but it's missing here.

Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting me to create a sample decision tree based on the given features. For instance, making up splits that make sense. Let's think of possible splits.

The target is to predict whether Lewis (1) or Holyfield (0) won the round. Let's imagine possible splits:

First, maybe the judge has a bias. For example, if the judge is, say, Judge 0 (E. Williams), maybe they tend to favor Lewis. The first split could be on Judge.

Alternatively, official judges might have different criteria. Maybe if it's an official judge (Official=1), the decision is more accurate, so split on Official.

Another split could be on the Round number. For example, rounds in the later stages might have different outcomes.

Let me try to come up with a simple decision tree structure. Let's suppose the first split is on the Official judge.

Suppose the first node checks if the judge is official (Official = 1). Then, depending on that, split further.

Alternatively, the first split could be on the Round. For instance, if Round > 8, then maybe the prediction is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on the judge's identity. Let's pick some plausible splits.

Let me try to outline a hypothetical decision tree:

Root node: If Judge is HBO-Lederman (3), then predict 1 (Lewis). Else, check next condition.

Wait, that's too simplistic. Let me think of a tree with a few splits.

Let's say:

First split: If the Official is 1 (Yes), then check the Round. If Round > 8, predict 1 (Lewis). Else, check Judge. For example, if the judge is ESPN (8), predict 0 (Holyfield). Otherwise, maybe predict 1.

Alternatively, here's a possible structure:

Node 0: If the judge is either HBO-Lederman (3) or Boxing Times (5), then proceed to Node 1. Else, Node 2.

Wait, maybe I should structure this step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on the Round. Let's say the first node checks if Round is greater than 6. If yes, then proceed to another node, maybe checking if the judge is official. If not, maybe check another feature.

Alternatively, let's make a simple tree with 3 levels. Let's say:

Root node (node 0): If Round > 8, then go to node 1. Else, node 2.

Node1: If Official is 1, then predict 1 (Lewis). Else, predict 0.

Node2: Check the Judge. Suppose if Judge is ESPN (8), predict 0. Otherwise, 1.

Wait, but this is arbitrary. Since the user didn't provide the actual tree structure, it's difficult. Alternatively, perhaps the example given uses a decision tree with certain nodes, and the user wants me to adapt that example's structure to the boxing features.

Looking back at the example function:

In the example, the function has nodes[0] to nodes[4], each is a condition on a feature. Then the if-else structure follows the nodes' conditions to decide the prediction.

Perhaps the user expects me to create a similar structure but using the boxing features. Since the actual tree isn't provided, maybe I need to make up a plausible one based on the features' possible splits.

Let me try to think of a possible decision tree structure for the boxing problem.

Suppose the first split (node 0) is on the Official judge. Let's say:

nodes[0] = (X['Official'] == 1)

Then, if it's an official judge, go to node 1, else to node 2.

Suppose node1 is a split on Round: if Round > 8, then predict 1 (Lewis). Else, check another node.

Alternatively, node1 could split on Judge. For example, if the judge is Judge 8 (ESPN), then predict 0.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on Round:

nodes[0] = (X['Round'] <= 6)

Then, if yes (<=6), go to node1; else, node2.

In node1, perhaps check if the judge is official (Official ==1), leading to different paths.

Alternatively, let me try to make a tree with 3 levels for simplicity.

Suppose the first node (0) is: Judge is HBO-Lederman (3) or Boxing Times (5). Let's say the condition is X['Judge'] in [3,5], which can be written as (X['Judge'] >=3) & (X['Judge'] <=5), but since it's a split, perhaps splitting at 3.5, so <=3.5. But Judge is an integer. So nodes[0] = X['Judge'] <= 3 ?

Alternatively, let's pick thresholds that make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is on the Round. Let's suppose:

nodes[0] = X['Round'] > 8. If yes, then maybe in later rounds, Lewis is more likely to win. So if true, go to node1; else node2.

In node1 (assuming Round>8), check if the judge is official (Official=1). If yes, then predict 1 (Lewis). If not, maybe predict 0.

Alternatively, here's a possible structure:

nodes[0] = X['Round'] > 6 → if yes, go to node1, else node2.

node1: X['Official'] == 1 → if yes, predict 1 (Lewis). else, node3.

node3: X['Judge'] == 8 (ESPN), then predict 0, else 1.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to outline a possible decision tree with three nodes, but keeping in mind that the example had 5 nodes, so maybe I need to create a tree with 5 nodes.

Alternatively, here's a possible 5-node decision tree structure:

node0: if Judge is HBO-Lederman (3) → threshold 3.5? So X['Judge'] <=3 → if yes, proceed to node1. Else, node2.

node1: if Round > 8 → yes → node3, else node4.

node2: if Official is 1 → node4, else node3.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I need to structure the code step by step.

Alternatively, let me think of a decision tree that uses all three features. Let's see:

Suppose the first split (node0) is on the Official feature. If the judge is official (Official=1), then proceed to node1; else, node2.

node1: Check Round. If Round >8 → node3 (predict 1). Else, node4 (maybe check Judge).

node2: Check Judge. If Judge is ESPN (8) → node4 (predict 0). Else, node5 (predict 1).

Wait, but how many nodes do I need? The example had 5 nodes, so perhaps I should have 5 conditions.

Alternatively, let me try to create a 5-node tree, similar to the example.

In the example, the first node (nodes[0]) is a condition, then based on that, they go into nested if-else.

Let me try to set up a tree where:

nodes[0] = (X['Official'] == 1)

nodes[1] = (X['Round'] > 8)

nodes[2] = (X['Judge'] == 3) # HBO-Lederman

nodes[3] = (X['Round'] <= 5)

nodes[4] = (X['Judge'] != 8) # Not ESPN

Then, the code would have to structure the paths based on these.

Alternatively, here's a possible structure:

The first condition is node0: if Official is 1 (yes), then check node1 (Round>8). If both are true, predict 1.

Else, if Official is yes, but Round not >8 → check node2 (Judge is HBO, etc.)

Alternatively, perhaps the code could look like:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [0]  # initializing to 0, then set to 1 if condition met

    # nodes[0]: if Official is 1 (official judge)
    nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1

    # nodes[1]: if Round > 8
    nodes[1] = X['Round'] > 8

    # nodes[2]: if Judge is HBO-Lederman (3)
    nodes[2] = X['Judge'] == 3

    # nodes[3]: if Round <=5
    nodes[3] = X['Round'] <=5

    # nodes[4]: if Judge is not ESPN (8)
    nodes[4] = X['Judge'] !=8

    if nodes[0]:  # official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # Round>8 → predict 1 (Lewis)
            prediction =1
        else:  # Round <=8
            if nodes[2]:  # if Judge is HBO-Lederman → predict 0
                prediction =0
            else:
                prediction =1
    else:  # not official
        if nodes[3]:  # Round <=5 → check Judge
            if nodes[4]:  # not ESPN → predict 1
                prediction =1
            else:
                prediction =0  # ESPN
        else:  # Round >5
            prediction =0

    return prediction, nodes

Wait, but this may not use all 5 nodes. Let's see:

In this setup, nodes[0],1,2,3,4 are used, but how the conditions are structured.

Alternatively, maybe adjust the nodes to use all 5. Let me see:

Suppose nodes[0] is Official, nodes[1] is Round>8.

nodes[2] is Judge <5 (so 0-4), nodes[3] is Round <3, nodes[4] is Judge !=8.

Then the code can have more branches.

Alternatively, perhaps the example's structure can be mirrored but with the given features.

In the example, the function has nodes[0] to nodes[4], each a condition, then nested if-else.

The example's code structure is:

if nodes[0]:

    if nodes[1]:

        if nodes[2]:

            if nodes[3]:

                if nodes[4]:

                    prediction = 1

                else:

                    etc.

        else:

            etc.

    else:

        etc.

    etc.

So I need to structure my code similarly, using the features.

Perhaps the first condition is on Official (node0), then Round (node1), then Judge (node2), then another feature, etc.

Alternatively, here's a possible approach:

Suppose the decision tree splits first on Official:

node0: if Official ==1 (yes), then proceed to node1 (Round>8).

Else, node2 (Round <=6).

Then, in node1 (Round>8), check if Judge is HBO-Lederman (node2: Judge ==3).

If yes → predict 1 (Lewis). Else, node3 (maybe another condition).

Alternatively, perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Since without the actual tree structure, it's challenging. But the user might expect me to make up a plausible tree based on the features.

Alternatively, perhaps the user expects me to use the features in a way that makes sense. Let's assume that the first split is on the Official judge. Let's say:

nodes[0] = X['Official'] ==1 → official judge.

Then, if true, go to node1 (Round>8 → yes, then predict 1; else, node2 (Judge is HBO-Lederman → predict 0).

If not official, then node3 (Judge is ESPN → predict 0, else node4 (Round <=5 → predict 1).

This is arbitrary but plausible.

Alternatively, here's a structured approach:

Let me define the nodes as follows:

nodes[0]: Official ==1 → if yes, proceed to node1, else node2.

node1: Round >8 → yes (node3 → predict 1), no (node4 → check Judge).

node2: Round <=5 → yes (node4 → predict 0), no (node5 → predict 1).

But this may not fit into 5 nodes.

Alternatively, let's try to write code that uses 5 nodes, following the example's structure.

Suppose:

nodes[0] = (X['Official'] ==1) → official?

nodes[1] = (X['Round'] >8)

nodes[2] = (X['Judge'] ==3) → HBO-Lederman?

nodes[3] = (X['Round'] <=5)

nodes[4] = (X['Judge'] !=8) → not ESPN?

Then code:

def predict(X):
    nodes = [0]*5
    nodes[0] = (X['Official'] ==1)
    nodes[1] = (X['Round']>8)
    nodes[2] = (X['Judge'] ==3)
    nodes[3] = (X['Round']<=5)
    nodes[4] = (X['Judge'] !=8)

    if nodes[0]:  # official
        if nodes[1]:  # round>8 → predict 1
            prediction =1
        else:  # round <=8
            if nodes[2]:  # judge is HBO → predict 0
                prediction =0
            else:
                prediction =1  # other judges
    else:  # not official
        if nodes[3]:  # round <=5 → check judge
            if nodes[4]:  # judge !=8 → predict1
                prediction =1
            else:  # judge is ESPN → 0
                prediction =0
        else:  # round>5 → predict0
            prediction =0
    return prediction, nodes

This uses all 5 nodes and follows a structure similar to the example. The nodes are assigned conditions on the features, and the if-else structure uses them to decide the prediction. This seems plausible.

Alternatively, perhaps some nodes can be combined differently, but this is a possible solution.

Thus, I will proceed with this code structure, ensuring that all nodes are used and the logic is based on the given features.
