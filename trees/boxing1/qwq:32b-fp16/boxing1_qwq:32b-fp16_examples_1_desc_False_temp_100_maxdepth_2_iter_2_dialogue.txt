Alright, so the user has given me a task where I need to build a decision tree classifier with specific features and constraints. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, looking at the example provided using Iris dataset features. The tree is built on petal width, which is split into two nodes at 0.80 cm, then further splits versicolor and virginica based on another threshold of 1.75 cm. This shows that the user expects a tree with a maximum depth of 2, so it won't be too complex.

Now, the main task is to classify which boxer, Lewis or Holyfield, won each round using different features. The features provided are Judge (with multiple options), Official judge (yes/no), and Round (1-12). My first thought is that I need to determine which of these features are most important for predicting the winner.

I'll start by considering each feature's relevance. The "Judge" feature has several options, including different judges and sources like HBO-Lederman or ESPN. Each judge might have biases or tendencies in scoring, so this could be a significant factor. Next, whether the judge is an official (yes/no) adds another layer because official judges' scores are more influential in determining the actual winner.

The "Round" feature ranges from 1 to 12, which indicates the round number in the fight. It's possible that certain rounds might have patterns; for example, a fighter might start strong or finish strong, affecting how judges score those rounds.

Since I need to build a tree with a maximum depth of 2, I can only use up to two decision nodes. So I should choose the most influential features first. The "Judge" seems crucial because different judges might lean towards one boxer over another. Official status also matters as it adds credibility and weight to their judgment.

I think the primary split should be on whether the judge is an official or not. If a judge is official, that score is more likely to reflect the actual outcome. Then, within the official judges, I can further split based on who they are. For instance, HBO-Lederman might have a tendency towards one boxer, while ESPN might lean another way.

Alternatively, if I split first by the specific judge, it might complicate the tree beyond depth 2 when considering officials. So starting with the broader category of official vs non-official makes sense for simplicity and effectiveness.

For non-official judges, the decision could be based on the majority opinion or other metrics, but since we're limited to two features, I'll focus on the judge's identity. Maybe certain non-official sources consistently favor one boxer over another.

I also have to consider the Round number. It might be useful as a secondary feature, especially for official judges, where in later rounds one boxer could dominate. But given the depth constraint, I think prioritizing Judge and their status is more impactful.

Putting it all together, the decision tree will first check if the judge is an official. If yes, it'll then look at which specific judge it is to decide the winner. If not an official judge, it might default based on another feature like Round or specific non-official judges' tendencies.

I need to make sure each path in the tree leads to a clear classification of either Lewis or Holyfield winning the round without exceeding the depth limit. Testing with sample data would help validate if this structure accurately predicts the outcomes, but since I don't have actual data here, I'll rely on logical assumptions about how these features influence the result.

In conclusion, structuring the tree to first evaluate whether the judge is official and then drilling down into specific judges within that category seems like a solid approach. This way, it's both simple and leverages the most impactful features effectively.

Based on the provided features (Judge, Official judge, Round), I will attempt to build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 to classify which boxer (Lewis or Holyfield) won each round.

### Decision Tree:
|--- Offical judge: yes  
||--- Judge: HBO-Lederman / ESPN  
||||--- class: Lewis  
||--- Judge: E. Williams / L. O'Connell / S. Christodoulu / Sportsticker / Boxing Times / Sportsline / Associated Press / Boxing Monthly-Leach  
||||--- class: Holyfield  
|--- Offical judge: no  
||--- Round <= 6  
||||--- class: Lewis  
||--- Round > 6  
||||--- class: Holyfield  

### Explanation:
1. **First Split**: The tree first splits based on whether the judge is an official judge (`Offical judge: yes` or `no`). Official judges are more likely to have their scores influence the outcome of the round.
2. **Second Split (if Offical judge: yes)**: If the judge is an official judge, the tree further splits based on the specific judge. Judges like HBO-Lederman and ESPN are assumed to favor Lewis, while other judges (e.g., E. Williams, L. O'Connell, etc.) are assumed to favor Holyfield.
3. **Second Split (if Offical judge: no)**: If the judge is not an official judge, the tree splits based on the round number. Rounds 1-6 favor Lewis, while rounds 7-12 favor Holyfield.

This decision tree uses a combination of the most important features (`Offical judge` and `Judge`) to classify the winner of each round.

Okay, so I need to create a Python function that predicts which boxer won each round based on the given features and then returns both the prediction and a list of truth values representing the inner nodes of the decision tree. The decision tree has a maximum depth of two, meaning it can have up to two inner nodes.

First, I'll recall the features provided:

- 'Judge': This is encoded as an integer from 0 to 9, each corresponding to a specific judge.
- 'Official': This is a binary feature where 1 means "Yes" and 0 means "No".
- 'Round': An integer between 1 and 12 indicating the round number.
- The target variable indicates whether Lewis (1) or Holyfield (0) won the round.

The goal is to translate my decision tree into a function that uses these features to make predictions. My decision tree was based on two main splits: first by 'Official' status, and then within each of those branches, further splitting either by 'Judge' or 'Round'.

So, for the function:

1. **Determine the inner nodes**: In my decision tree, the first split is on 'Official'. If 'Official' is 1 (Yes), we look at 'Judge'; if 'Official' is 0 (No), we consider 'Round'.

2. **Thresholds**: For 'Judge', I need to determine a threshold that separates judges who are more likely to favor Lewis from those who might not. Similarly, for 'Round', rounds 1-6 might favor Lewis, while 7-12 favor Holyfield.

3. **Prediction Logic**: Based on the splits and thresholds, assign a prediction of 0 (Holyfield) or 1 (Lewis).

4. **Return Values**: The function should return both the predicted winner and a list indicating whether each inner node condition was met (1 if true, 0 otherwise).

Now, to code this:

- Start by extracting 'Official', 'Judge', and 'Round' from the input dictionary.
- Set up the nodes list with initial placeholders.
- Fill in the conditions for each node based on thresholds.
- Use conditional statements to determine the final prediction.
- Finally, return the prediction along with the nodes list containing 1s or 0s based on whether each condition was met.

I need to ensure that the function correctly maps the feature values and thresholds according to my decision tree's logic. Also, I should test it with sample inputs to verify accuracy.

Here is a Python function that implements your decision tree for predicting which boxer won each round:

```python
def predict_round_winner(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list with placeholders (will be updated)
    nodes = [None, None]
    
    # Determine the conditions for each inner node
    official_status = X["Official"] == 1  # Check if the judge is official
    judge_id = X["Judge"]               # Get the judge's ID
    
    # Assign truth values to nodes based on conditions
    nodes[0] = int(official_status)     # Node 0: 1 if Official is Yes, else 0
    
    if official_status:
        # If Official is Yes, use Judge as the next condition
        lewis_favoring_judges = [3, 8]   # Judges HBO-Lederman and ESPN (IDs 3 and 8) favor Lewis more
        nodes[1] = int(judge_id in lewis_favoring_judges)
    else:
        # If Official is No, use Round as the next condition
        early_rounds = X["Round"] <= 6   # Rounds 1-6 are considered early rounds
        nodes[1] = int(early_rounds)
    
    # Determine prediction based on node conditions
    if official_status:
        if judge_id in [3, 8]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
    else:
        if X["Round"] <= 6:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins early rounds
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins later rounds
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation of the Function:**

- **Initialization**: The `nodes` list is initialized to keep track of whether each inner node's condition is met.
  
- **First Inner Node (Official Status)**: Checks if the judge is official. If true (`1`), it proceeds to evaluate the next condition based on the 'Judge' feature.

- **Second Inner Node (Judge or Round)**:
  - For *Official* judges, it checks if the judge is known to favor Lewis more (e.g., HBO-Lederman and ESPN, corresponding to IDs `3` and `8`). If true (`1`), Lewis is predicted to win.
  - For *Non-official* judges, it evaluates the round number. Rounds 1-6 are considered early rounds favorable to Lewis.

- **Prediction**: Based on the conditions met in the nodes, the function predicts whether Lewis (`1`) or Holyfield (`0`) won the round.

This function captures the essence of your decision tree logic and translates it into executable code that can be used for predictions based on the given features.
