Alright, so I have this problem where I need to build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2. The goal is to classify which of the two boxers, Lewis or Holyfield, won each round based on given features.

First, let me understand the features provided:

1. **Judge**: This seems to be a categorical feature indicating who the judge is. There are multiple possible judges listed.
2. **Official Judge (yes/no)**: This is a binary feature indicating whether the judge is an official one or not.
3. **Round (1 to 12)**: An ordinal feature representing the round number in the fight.

I need to use these features to build a decision tree that classifies each round as won by either Lewis or Holyfield, with the tree having no more than two levels of depth. That means the root node can have children (level 1), and those children can have their own children (level 2), but no further.

I'm thinking about how to approach this. Decision trees work best when they can split data effectively at each node, so I need to choose the most informative features first.

Starting with the root node: Which feature will be most useful for splitting the data? Let's evaluate each feature's potential:

- **Judge**: Since it's a categorical variable with many possible values, using it as the root might lead to a lot of branches even at level 1. This could complicate things, especially since we're limited to depth 2.
  
- **Official Judge (yes/no)**: This is a binary feature and might provide a good initial split. It divides the data into two broad groups which can then be further split in level 2.
  
- **Round**: Round number could also be useful as it's an ordinal variable, indicating progression through the fight. Maybe later rounds have different patterns than earlier ones.

Considering that the maximum depth is 2, I think starting with a binary feature would make more sense because each split can lead to up to two children, and then each of those can split again. So, using "Official Judge" as the root seems practical.

So, the first split is based on whether the judge is an official one or not.

At level 1 (children of root), we have two nodes: "Official Judge = yes" and "Official Judge = no".

Now, for each of these nodes, I need to decide how to split further. Since depth can't exceed 2, these will be leaf nodes if they don't split further or internal nodes with their own children.

But wait, maximum depth is 2, so the tree can have up to two splits. So from the root, each child (level 1) can split again into level 2.

Therefore, for "Official Judge = yes", I need another feature to split on, and similarly for "Official Judge = no".

Looking back at features: After using "Official Judge" as the first split, we have "Judge" and "Round" left. Let's consider which would be more effective.

If we use "Round" next, it's an ordinal variable that might show a trend. Maybe in later rounds, one fighter tends to win more, or vice versa.

Alternatively, using "Judge" could mean splitting based on specific judges' tendencies, but since it's categorical with many options, each split would create multiple nodes at level 2, which might not be ideal given the depth constraint.

However, if we have to limit the tree to maximum depth of 2, perhaps we need to use another binary feature or an ordinal one that can be split into a couple of groups. Since "Round" is from 1 to 12, maybe splitting it into early, middle, and late rounds could help, but with depth constraint, I can only do two splits at level 2.

Wait, perhaps better to use "Round" as the second feature for splitting. Let me think: if "Official Judge = yes", then in lower round numbers (say, <=6), Holyfield might be winning more, and in higher rounds (>6), Lewis might take over. Alternatively, it could be the other way around.

But without actual data, I'm speculating. However, since this is an exercise, perhaps the assumption can be made that later rounds favor one fighter over the other.

Alternatively, using "Judge" at level 2: maybe certain judges are more likely to score for Lewis or Holyfield, but since it's a multi-category variable, each split would lead to multiple branches. However, with maximum depth 2, we can't go beyond that, so perhaps grouping similar judges together based on their tendencies.

But without data, this is tricky. Maybe in the context of this problem, using "Round" as the second feature is more straightforward since it's an ordinal variable and can be split into two groups easily (e.g., rounds 1-6 vs 7-12).

So, putting it together:

Root: Official Judge (yes/no)

At level 1:

- If yes, then split on Round <=6 vs >6
- If no, perhaps split on another feature, maybe "Judge". But since "Judge" is multi-category, splitting into two groups might not be straightforward. Alternatively, we could still use Round.

Wait, but if I'm constrained to depth 2, each node at level 1 can have up to two children in level 2. So for the "Official Judge = yes" branch, split on Round (<=6 and >6). For "Official Judge = no", maybe split on another feature, perhaps "Judge". But since "Judge" is categorical with many options, it's not ideal.

Alternatively, maybe use Round again in both branches.

So:

Root: Official Judge

- If yes:
  - Split on Round <=6: Classify as Holyfield
  - Split on Round >6: Classify as Lewis
- If no:
  - Maybe split on another feature. Since we only have "Judge" left, perhaps group judges into two categories: those who favor Lewis and those who favor Holyfield.

But without knowing the actual tendencies of each judge, this is speculative. Alternatively, maybe use Round again here.

Alternatively, since I'm limited to depth 2, perhaps for the "Official Judge = no" branch, instead of splitting further, just classify based on majority or something else. But that might not be optimal.

Wait, but in a decision tree, each internal node must split until it reaches maximum depth. So if I set max_depth=2, then the root splits into two, and each of those can split again, leading to up to four leaves.

So perhaps for "Official Judge = yes", split on Round <=6 vs >6, as before.

For "Official Judge = no", maybe split on another feature. Since we have "Judge" left, but it's multi-category, maybe group the judges into two categories based on some criteria. For example, let's say certain judges are known to favor Lewis more (e.g., HBO-Lederman, ESPN) and others might lean towards Holyfield (e.g., Associated Press, Boxing Monthly-Leach). But without actual data, this is just a guess.

So for the "Official Judge = no" branch:

- If the judge is in group A (Lewis-favoring), classify as Lewis
- Else, classify as Holyfield

Alternatively, use Round again here. Maybe in unofficial judges, earlier rounds are more likely to be won by Holyfield and later rounds by Lewis.

But I think sticking with Round for both branches would make the tree more consistent.

So:

Root: Official Judge (yes/no)

If yes:
- Split on Round <=6 vs >6
  - If Round <=6: Holyfield
  - Else: Lewis

If no:
- Split on Round <=6 vs >6
  - If Round <=6: Holyfield
  - Else: Lewis

But this makes the tree symmetric, which might not capture the nuances of official vs unofficial judges. Maybe for "Official Judge = yes", the split is different than for "no".

Alternatively, perhaps the behavior changes based on whether the judge is official.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps Official Judges are more consistent in their scoring, so Round would be a better indicator, whereas non-official might have different patterns.

But again, without data, it's hard. Maybe I should proceed with using Round as the second split for both branches.

Alternatively, use "Judge" in one branch and "Round" in another, but that complicates things.

Wait, maybe let's try:

Root: Official Judge (yes/no)

If yes:
- Split on Round <=6 vs >6
  - Round <=6: Holyfield
  - Round >6: Lewis

If no:
- Split on whether the judge is, say, Boxing Monthly or not. But this gets too granular.

Alternatively, maybe for non-official judges, they tend to favor Holyfield more regardless of round, so:

Root: Official Judge (yes/no)

If yes:
- If Round <=6: Holyfield
  Else: Lewis

If no:
- Classify as Holyfield

But that might not be accurate. Alternatively, if unofficial judges are more likely to give rounds to Lewis.

This is getting too speculative.

Perhaps the best approach is:

Root: Official Judge (yes/no)

At level 1:

- If yes:
  - Split on Round <=6 vs >6
    - Holyfield for <=6
    - Lewis for >6

- If no:
  - Split on Round <=6 vs >6 as well, same as above.

But then the tree is symmetric, which might not be ideal. Alternatively, perhaps non-official judges have different patterns.

Alternatively, maybe for non-official judges, use another feature like Judge being E or not.

Wait, perhaps it's better to stick with Round in both branches but assign different thresholds.

For example:

Root: Official Judge (yes/no)

If yes:
- If Round <=6: Holyfield
  Else: Lewis

If no:
- Maybe the opposite: If Round >6: Holyfield, else Lewis.

But again, without data, it's arbitrary.

Alternatively, perhaps non-official judges tend to favor the underdog more, but without knowing who that is, it's hard.

This is getting too convoluted. Given this is an exercise, I think using Round as the second split for both branches would be acceptable, even if symmetric.
</think>

To create a decision tree for determining the winner of each round based on whether the judge is official and the round number:

1. **Root Node: Official Judge (Yes/No)**
   - If the judge is an official judge:
     - **Split on Round Number**:
       - Rounds 1-6: Classify as Holyfield.
       - Rounds 7-12: Classify as Lewis.
   - If the judge is not an official judge:
     - **Split on Round Number**:
       - Rounds 1-6: Classify as Holyfield.
       - Rounds 7-12: Classify as Lewis.

This approach uses round number as a consistent second split for both branches, assuming that regardless of the judge's official status, later rounds favor one fighter and earlier rounds the other.

Okay, so I need to create a Python function that implements a decision tree for predicting the target variable based on the given features. The function should return both the prediction and a list of truth values from the inner nodes.

First, let me understand the problem. The target is to predict which boxer won the round (Lewis or Holyfield) based on features like Judge, Official, Round, etc. 

Looking at the example provided, I see that they used HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level as decision points. Each node in the tree corresponds to a condition, and the nodes list captures whether each condition was met (1 if true, 0 otherwise).

So, I need to design a similar function but tailored to the given features.

Let me think about possible decision points for this problem:

1. Judge: Since there are multiple judges, perhaps certain judges are more likely to score in favor of one boxer. Maybe if the judge is HBO-Lederman (3), it might lean towards Lewis.

2. Official: Whether the person is an official judge could influence the decision, but I'm not sure how. Perhaps officials are more consistent or biased?

3. Round: The round number might matter because later rounds could be more decisive. Maybe if the round is greater than a certain number, it's more likely to be Holyfield.

Wait, let me think about how to structure this.

I'll need to create conditions based on these features that lead to predicting 0 or 1 for the target variable (Holyfield or Lewis).

Let me outline possible nodes:

- Node 0: Check if Judge is HBO-Lederman (3). If yes, maybe it's more likely to be a certain outcome.
- Node 1: Check if Round is greater than 6. Maybe in later rounds, Holyfield performed better.

So the tree could look like this:

If Judge == 3:
    Then prediction = 0 (Holyfield)
Else:
    If Round >6:
        prediction = 1 (Lewis)
    Else:
        prediction = 0

Wait, that's a possible structure. But I'm not sure if that's accurate. Alternatively, maybe the conditions are different.

Alternatively:

If the Official is Yes (1), then predict based on Round: if Round <=6, Lewis wins, else Holyfield.

But without knowing the actual data distribution, it's hard to set meaningful thresholds. However, since the problem asks me to fill in placeholders with meaningful values, I can make educated guesses.

Another approach could be:

- If the Judge is one of certain types (e.g., HBO-Lederman), predict 0 (Holyfield).
- Else, if Round >6 and Official is Yes, predict 1 (Lewis).
- Otherwise, predict 0.

Wait, maybe that's too vague. Let me structure it with two nodes:

Node 0: Is the Judge equal to HBO-Lederman (3)?
Node 1: Is the Round greater than 8?

Then the tree could be:

if Node0:
    prediction = 0
else:
    if Node1:
        prediction =1
    else:
        prediction=0

This would mean that if the judge is HBO-Lederman, Holyfield wins. Otherwise, in later rounds (after 8), Lewis wins.

I think this makes sense because perhaps HBO-Lederman might have favored Holyfield, and in later rounds, Lewis might have taken over.

So now I can structure the function accordingly.

In code:

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = []
    
    # Node 0: Is Judge HBO-Lederman (3)?
    node0 = X['Judge'] == 3
    nodes.append(node0)
    
    # Node 1: Is Round >8?
    node1 = X['Round'] >8
    nodes.append(node1)
    
    if node0:
        prediction = 0
    else:
        if node1:
            prediction =1
        else:
            prediction=0
    
    return prediction, [int(n) for n in nodes]

Wait, the example uses a list of truth values as integers. So I need to convert each node's boolean to 1 or 0.

Testing this function:

If Judge is 3: prediction is 0.
Else, if Round>8: prediction 1; else 0.

This seems logical based on my assumptions.

I think that's a reasonable approach given the problem constraints.
</think>

Here is the Python function implementing the decision tree to predict which boxer won the round based on the given features:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = []
    
    # Node 0: Check if the Judge is HBO-Lederman (value 3)
    node0 = X['Judge'] == 3
    nodes.append(node0)
    
    # Node 1: Check if the Round is greater than 8
    node1 = X['Round'] > 8
    nodes.append(node1)
    
    if node0:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins if judged by HBO-Lederman
    else:
        if node1:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins in later rounds (after Round 8)
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins in earlier rounds
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function first checks the judge's identity and then considers the round number to make a prediction. The list `nodes` captures whether each condition was met as 1 (True) or 0 (False).
