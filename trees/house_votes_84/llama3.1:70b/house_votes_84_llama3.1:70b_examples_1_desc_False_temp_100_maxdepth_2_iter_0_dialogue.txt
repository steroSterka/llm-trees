Based on the provided features, I will induce a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 to classify party affiliation as Democrat or Republican.

After analyzing the features, I selected the top two most important features based on their potential impact on party affiliation. Here is the induced decision tree:

|--- Vote on aid to El Salvador (yes / no)
||--- yes
|||--- class: Republican
||--- no
|||--- Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (yes / no)
||||--- yes
|||||--- class: Democrat
||||--- no
|||||--- class: Republican

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* The first split is based on the vote on aid to El Salvador. Voting "yes" on this issue tends to be associated with Republicans.
* If the vote on aid to El Salvador is "no", the next split is based on the vote on adoption of the budget resolution. Voting "yes" on this issue tends to be associated with Democrats.

Note that this decision tree has a maximum depth of 2, as requested. Also, please keep in mind that this is just one possible decision tree that can be induced from these features, and different algorithms or approaches might produce slightly different results.

Would you like me to explain the reasoning behind selecting these specific features, or would you like to test this decision tree with some data?

Here is the Python function that represents the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2  # Vote on aid to El Salvador (yes)
    nodes[1] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2  # Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (yes)

    if not nodes[0]:  # no -> el-salvador-adi
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  
        prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where each key corresponds to a feature. The decision tree is evaluated based on the values of these features, and the final prediction (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) is returned along with the truth values of the inner nodes.

Please note that I've used the exact keys from your feature list to ensure compatibility. Also, I've assumed that the target variable "target" in your dataset corresponds to party affiliation, where 1 represents Republican and 0 represents Democrat.
