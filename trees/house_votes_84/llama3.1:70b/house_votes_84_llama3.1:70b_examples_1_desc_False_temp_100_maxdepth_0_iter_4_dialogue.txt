To induce a decision tree classifier using the provided features related to voting records, we need to determine which votes are most indicative of party affiliation. However, without access to specific data or outcomes of these votes correlated with party affiliations, I'll have to make some educated guesses based on typical political alignments in the United States during periods when such issues were relevant (notably, several of these votes hint at an era around the late 20th century).

Given that, here's a possible decision tree focusing on the most divisive or indicative issues:

1. **Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no)**  
   - This was a highly polarizing issue during the Cold War era, with Republicans generally in favor of supporting anti-Sandinista forces and Democrats opposing it.

Decision Tree:
|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras = yes
||--- class: Republican
|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras = no
||--- Vote on MX missile (yes / no)
||||--- Vote on MX missile = yes
|||||--- class: Republican
||||--- Vote on MX missile = no
|||||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes / no)
||||||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban = yes
|||||||--- class: Democrat
||||||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban = no
|||||||--- class: Republican

Rationale:
- The vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is a strong initial indicator because of its high political polarization during the relevant period.
- Following a 'no' on contras aid, the decision tree checks the stance on the MX missile. A 'yes' here suggests alignment with typically Republican defense policies.
- If the MX missile vote was also 'no', indicating potential pacifist or dovish tendencies, the next check is on the anti-satellite test ban. Supporting a ban could indicate alignment with more liberal (Democrat) views on disarmament and arms control.

Please note that this decision tree is highly speculative and based on general political trends rather than actual voting data correlated with party affiliations. In practice, inducing an accurate decision tree would require access to specific datasets linking these votes with known party affiliations of the voters or politicians in question.

Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting party affiliation based on voting records:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) based on voting records.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing voting records with keys as issue names and values as votes (1 = no, 2 = yes).
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the predicted party affiliation (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican) and a list of truth values for inner nodes.
    """
    
    # Initialize nodes with None
    nodes = [None] * 3
    
    # Node 0: Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras
    nodes[0] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2
    
    # Node 1: Vote on MX missile (only considered if Node 0 is False)
    nodes[1] = X['mx-missile'] == 2 if not nodes[0] else None
    
    # Node 2: Vote on anti-satellite test ban (only considered if Nodes 0 and 1 are False)
    nodes[2] = X['anti-satellite-test-ban'] == 2 if not nodes[0] and not nodes[1] else None
    
    # Predict party affiliation based on node values
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    elif nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    elif nodes[2]:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Republican (default)
    
    return prediction, [int(node) if node is not None else 0 for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing voting records as input and returns a tuple with the predicted party affiliation and a list of truth values for inner nodes. The decision tree logic is implemented using nested conditional statements to evaluate the votes on key issues.

Note that I've used the exact keys from your feature set and encoded the target variable according to your description (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican). Also, I've filled in meaningful values for the thresholds based on typical political alignments.
