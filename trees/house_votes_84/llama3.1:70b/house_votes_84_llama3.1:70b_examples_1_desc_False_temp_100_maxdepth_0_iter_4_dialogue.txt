To induce a decision tree classifier using the provided features related to voting records, we need to determine which votes are most indicative of party affiliation. However, without access to specific data or outcomes of these votes correlated with party affiliations, I'll have to make some educated guesses based on typical political alignments in the United States during periods when such issues were relevant (notably, several of these votes hint at an era around the late 20th century).

Given that, here's a possible decision tree focusing on the most divisive or indicative issues:

1. **Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no)**  
   - This was a highly polarizing issue during the Cold War era, with Republicans generally in favor of supporting anti-Sandinista forces and Democrats opposing it.

Decision Tree:
|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras = yes
||--- class: Republican
|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras = no
||--- Vote on MX missile (yes / no)
||||--- Vote on MX missile = yes
|||||--- class: Republican
||||--- Vote on MX missile = no
|||||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes / no)
||||||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban = yes
|||||||--- class: Democrat
||||||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban = no
|||||||--- class: Republican

Rationale:
- The vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is a strong initial indicator because of its high political polarization during the relevant period.
- Following a 'no' on contras aid, the decision tree checks the stance on the MX missile. A 'yes' here suggests alignment with typically Republican defense policies.
- If the MX missile vote was also 'no', indicating potential pacifist or dovish tendencies, the next check is on the anti-satellite test ban. Supporting a ban could indicate alignment with more liberal (Democrat) views on disarmament and arms control.

Please note that this decision tree is highly speculative and based on general political trends rather than actual voting data correlated with party affiliations. In practice, inducing an accurate decision tree would require access to specific datasets linking these votes with known party affiliations of the voters or politicians in question.
=======
Based on the provided features, I will build a decision tree classifier to predict party affiliation (Democrat or Republican). 

To determine the most important features, I'll use a simple approach by selecting the top 5 features that are likely to be most relevant for this task. These features are:

1. Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no)
2. Vote on MX missile (yes / no)
3. Vote on crime (yes / no)
4. Vote on education spending (yes / no)
5. Vote on superfund right to sue (yes / no)

Now, here's the decision tree:

|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras == yes
||--- class: Republican
|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras == no
||--- Vote on MX missile == yes
|||--- class: Republican
||--- Vote on MX missile == no
|||--- Vote on crime == yes
||||--- class: Republican
||||--- Vote on crime == no
|||||--- Vote on education spending == yes
||||||--- class: Democrat
||||||--- Vote on education spending == no
|||||||--- Vote on superfund right to sue == yes
||||||||--- class: Democrat
||||||||--- Vote on superfund right to sue == no
|||||||||--- class: Republican

This decision tree uses a combination of votes on key issues to classify party affiliation. Please note that this is a simplified example and actual decision trees can be more complex, depending on the specific requirements and data distribution.

Here's how it works:

* If a politician voted in favor of aid to Nicaraguan contras, they are classified as Republican.
* If not, and they voted in favor of the MX missile, they are also classified as Republican.
* If neither condition is met, but they voted in favor of tougher crime laws, they are again classified as Republican.
* Otherwise, if they voted in favor of increased education spending, they are likely a Democrat.
* Finally, if none of these conditions apply, and they voted against the superfund right to sue, they are more likely to be a Democrat.

Keep in mind that this is just one possible decision tree based on the provided features. There may be other valid trees depending on the specific characteristics of your data.

Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting party affiliation based on voting records:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) based on voting records.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing voting records with keys as issue names and values as votes (1 = no, 2 = yes).
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the predicted party affiliation (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican) and a list of truth values for inner nodes.
    """
    
    # Initialize nodes with None
    nodes = [None] * 3
    
    # Node 0: Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras
    nodes[0] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2
    
    # Node 1: Vote on MX missile (only considered if Node 0 is False)
    nodes[1] = X['mx-missile'] == 2 if not nodes[0] else None
    
    # Node 2: Vote on anti-satellite test ban (only considered if Nodes 0 and 1 are False)
    nodes[2] = X['anti-satellite-test-ban'] == 2 if not nodes[0] and not nodes[1] else None
    
    # Predict party affiliation based on node values
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    elif nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    elif nodes[2]:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Republican (default)
    
    return prediction, [int(node) if node is not None else 0 for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing voting records as input and returns a tuple with the predicted party affiliation and a list of truth values for inner nodes. The decision tree logic is implemented using nested conditional statements to evaluate the votes on key issues.

Note that I've used the exact keys from your feature set and encoded the target variable according to your description (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican). Also, I've filled in meaningful values for the thresholds based on typical political alignments.
=======
Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2
    nodes[1] = X["mx-missile"] == 2
    nodes[2] = X["crime"] == 2
    nodes[3] = X["education-spending"] == 2
    nodes[4] = X["superfund-right-to-sue"] == 2

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0
                else:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 0
                    else:
                        prediction = 1

    # Convert boolean values to integers (1 or 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where each key corresponds to a feature and the value is the feature's value. The function implements the decision tree logic using nested if-else statements. The nodes are evaluated based on the feature values, and the final prediction is returned along with the node values.

Note that I've assumed that the target variable `target` has been replaced by `prediction`, which takes a value of 1 for republican and 0 for democrat. Also, I've converted the boolean values in the nodes list to integers (1 or 0) before returning it.
