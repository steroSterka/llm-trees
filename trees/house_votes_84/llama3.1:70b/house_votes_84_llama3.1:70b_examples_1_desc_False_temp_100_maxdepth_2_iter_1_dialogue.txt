I'll build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 using the most important features to classify party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) based on the given voting records.

After analyzing the data, I've selected the top two most informative features: "Vote on aid to El Salvador" and "Vote on MX missile".

Here's the induced decision tree:

|--- Vote on aid to El Salvador == no
||--- class: Democrat (likely due to opposition to military interventions)
|--- Vote on aid to El Salvador == yes
||--- Vote on MX missile == no
|||--- class: Republican (likely due to support for conservative policies and military spending)
||--- Vote on MX missile == yes
|||--- class: Republican

Please note that this is a simplified decision tree, and actual party affiliations may be influenced by many more factors.

Here's the Python function for predicting party affiliation based on the voting records:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) based on voting records.

    Args:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing voting records with feature names as keys and votes (1 = no, 2 = yes) as values.

    Returns:
    prediction (int): Predicted party affiliation (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican).
    nodes (list): Truth values of inner nodes in the decision tree.
    """

    # Define the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Vote on aid to El Salvador (1 = no, 2 = yes)
    nodes[0] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 1
    
    # Node 1: Vote on MX missile (1 = no, 2 = yes) if node 0 is False
    nodes[1] = not nodes[0] and X["mx-missile"] == 1

    # Make prediction based on decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    elif nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Default to Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing voting records as input and returns the predicted party affiliation along with the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree. The decision tree is based on the features "el-salvador-adi" (vote on aid to El Salvador) and "mx-missile" (vote on MX missile), which are used to predict whether a representative is likely to be a Democrat or Republican.
