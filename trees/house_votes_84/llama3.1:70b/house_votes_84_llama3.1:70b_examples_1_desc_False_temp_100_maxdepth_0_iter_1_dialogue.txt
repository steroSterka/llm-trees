Based on the provided features, I'll attempt to build a decision tree that classifies party affiliation as Democrat or Republican. Please note that this is a simplified example and may not accurately represent real-world data.

After analyzing the features, I've selected the top 5 most important ones for building the decision tree:

1. Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no)
2. Vote on MX missile (yes / no)
3. Vote on aid to El Salvador (yes / no)
4. Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes / no)
5. Vote on crime (yes / no)

Here's the decision tree:
```
|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras == yes
||--- class: Republican
|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras == no
||--- Vote on MX missile == yes
|||--- class: Republican
||--- Vote on MX missile == no
|||--- Vote on aid to El Salvador == yes
||||--- class: Democrat
|||--- Vote on aid to El Salvador == no
||||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban == yes
|||||--- class: Democrat
||||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban == no
|||||--- Vote on crime == yes
||||||--- class: Republican
||||||--- Vote on crime == no
|||||||--- class: Democrat
```
Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* If a senator voted in favor of aid to Nicaraguan contras, they are likely a Republican.
* If not, and they voted in favor of the MX missile, they are also likely a Republican.
* If they didn't vote for either, but did vote in favor of aid to El Salvador, they are likely a Democrat.
* If none of these conditions apply, and they voted against an anti-satellite test ban, they are likely a Democrat.
* Finally, if all else fails, and they voted in favor of stricter crime laws, they are likely a Republican. Otherwise, they are a Democrat.

Please keep in mind that this is a simplified example and actual decision trees may be more complex and involve additional features or interactions between features.

Based on the provided features, I will build a decision tree classifier using the most important features to classify party affiliation as either Democrat or Republican.

After analyzing the features, I selected the top 5 most informative features that contribute the most to the classification. These features are:

1. Vote on aid to El Salvador (yes / no)
2. Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes / no)
3. Vote on MX missile (yes / no)
4. Vote on crime (yes / no)
5. Vote on Export Administration Act - South Africa (yes / no)

Using these features, the decision tree is:

|--- Vote on aid to El Salvador == yes
||--- class: Republican
|--- Vote on aid to El Salvador == no
||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban == yes
|||--- class: Democrat
||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban == no
|||--- Vote on MX missile == yes
||||--- class: Republican
|||--- Vote on MX missile == no
||||--- Vote on crime == yes
|||||--- class: Democrat
||||--- Vote on crime == no
|||||--- Vote on Export Administration Act - South Africa == yes
||||||--- class: Democrat
|||||--- Vote on Export Administration Act - South Africa == no
||||||--- class: Republican

Note that this decision tree is not exhaustive, and there may be other possible trees with similar performance. However, this tree captures the most important features and their relationships to classify party affiliation.

Here's a brief explanation of each feature and its contribution:

* Vote on aid to El Salvador: This feature seems to be highly correlated with Republican affiliation.
* Vote on anti-satellite test ban: Democrats tend to vote against this ban, while Republicans are more likely to support it.
* Vote on MX missile: Republicans generally support the development of the MX missile, whereas Democrats tend to oppose it.
* Vote on crime: Democrats often take a tougher stance on crime, which is reflected in their voting behavior.
* Vote on Export Administration Act - South Africa: This feature captures the parties' differing views on trade and sanctions.

Keep in mind that this analysis is based on the provided features and might not reflect real-world complexities. The decision tree should be interpreted as a simplified representation of the relationship between these specific features and party affiliation.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
<<<<<<< HEAD
    nodes[0] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2
    nodes[1] = X["mx-missile"] == 2
    nodes[2] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2
    nodes[3] = X["anti-satellite-test-ban"] == 2
    nodes[4] = X["crime"] == 2

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    elif not nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # Democrat
                else:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # Republican
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, [int(x) for x in nodes]
```

Note that I've used the provided encoding scheme to make the function work correctly. Specifically:

* The `aid-to-nicaraguan-contras` feature is encoded as 2 (yes) or 1 (no).
* The `mx-missile`, `el-salvador-adi`, `anti-satellite-test-ban`, and `crime` features are also encoded as 2 (yes) or 1 (no).
* The target variable (`target`) is encoded as 1 (Republican) or 0 (Democrat).

The function returns a tuple containing the predicted party affiliation and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
=======
    nodes[0] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2
    nodes[1] = X["anti-satellite-test-ban"] == 2
    nodes[2] = X["mx-missile"] == 2
    nodes[3] = X["crime"] == 2
    nodes[4] = X["export-administration-act-south-africa"] == 2

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0
                else:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 0
                    else:
                        prediction = 1

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where each key corresponds to a feature and the value is the feature's value. The function then evaluates the decision tree based on these values and returns the predicted party affiliation (0 = democrat, 1 = republican) along with a list of boolean values representing the states of the nodes in the tree.

Note that I used `X["feature_name"] == 2` to check if a feature is equal to 2, since the problem statement specifies that 2 represents "yes" or "present" for each feature. Similarly, I used `[int(node) for node in nodes]` to convert the boolean values of the nodes into integers (0 or 1) before returning them.
