Based on the provided features, I'll attempt to build a decision tree that classifies party affiliation as Democrat or Republican. Please note that this is a simplified example and may not accurately represent real-world data.

After analyzing the features, I've selected the top 5 most important ones for building the decision tree:

1. Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no)
2. Vote on MX missile (yes / no)
3. Vote on aid to El Salvador (yes / no)
4. Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes / no)
5. Vote on crime (yes / no)

Here's the decision tree:
```
|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras == yes
||--- class: Republican
|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras == no
||--- Vote on MX missile == yes
|||--- class: Republican
||--- Vote on MX missile == no
|||--- Vote on aid to El Salvador == yes
||||--- class: Democrat
|||--- Vote on aid to El Salvador == no
||||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban == yes
|||||--- class: Democrat
||||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban == no
|||||--- Vote on crime == yes
||||||--- class: Republican
||||||--- Vote on crime == no
|||||||--- class: Democrat
```
Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

* If a senator voted in favor of aid to Nicaraguan contras, they are likely a Republican.
* If not, and they voted in favor of the MX missile, they are also likely a Republican.
* If they didn't vote for either, but did vote in favor of aid to El Salvador, they are likely a Democrat.
* If none of these conditions apply, and they voted against an anti-satellite test ban, they are likely a Democrat.
* Finally, if all else fails, and they voted in favor of stricter crime laws, they are likely a Republican. Otherwise, they are a Democrat.

Please keep in mind that this is a simplified example and actual decision trees may be more complex and involve additional features or interactions between features.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2
    nodes[1] = X["mx-missile"] == 2
    nodes[2] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2
    nodes[3] = X["anti-satellite-test-ban"] == 2
    nodes[4] = X["crime"] == 2

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    elif not nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # Democrat
                else:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # Republican
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, [int(x) for x in nodes]
```

Note that I've used the provided encoding scheme to make the function work correctly. Specifically:

* The `aid-to-nicaraguan-contras` feature is encoded as 2 (yes) or 1 (no).
* The `mx-missile`, `el-salvador-adi`, `anti-satellite-test-ban`, and `crime` features are also encoded as 2 (yes) or 1 (no).
* The target variable (`target`) is encoded as 1 (Republican) or 0 (Democrat).

The function returns a tuple containing the predicted party affiliation and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
