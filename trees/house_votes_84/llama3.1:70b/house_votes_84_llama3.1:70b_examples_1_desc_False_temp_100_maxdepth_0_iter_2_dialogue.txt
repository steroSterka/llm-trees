Based on the features you provided, I will induce a decision tree classifier using the most important features to classify party affiliation as either Democrat or Republican.

After analyzing the features, I found that some votes are more informative than others in distinguishing between Democrats and Republicans. Here is the induced decision tree:

|--- Vote on MX missile (yes / no)
||--- yes
|||--- class: Republican
||--- no
|||--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no)
||||--- yes
|||||--- class: Republican
||||--- no
|||||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes / no)
||||||--- yes
|||||||--- class: Democrat
||||||--- no
|||||||--- class: Republican

This decision tree uses three features to classify party affiliation:

1. Vote on MX missile: This vote is a strong indicator of party affiliation, with Republicans more likely to support the MX missile and Democrats opposing it.
2. Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras: If the legislator voted against the MX missile, their vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras becomes a deciding factor. Republicans tend to support aid to the contras, while Democrats oppose it.
3. Vote on anti-satellite test ban: If the legislator voted against both the MX missile and aid to Nicaraguan contras, their vote on the anti-satellite test ban determines their party affiliation. Democrats tend to support the ban, while Republicans oppose it.

Note that this decision tree is not exhaustive, and there may be other features that could improve its accuracy. Additionally, the tree's performance may vary depending on the specific dataset used for training and testing.

Here is the Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes for the decision tree model based on the given features and target variable.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["mx-missile"] == 2  # Vote on MX missile is yes
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2  # Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is yes
    nodes[2] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2  # Vote on aid to El Salvador is yes
    nodes[3] = X["immigration"] == 2  # Vote on immigration is yes
    nodes[4] = X["religious-groups-in-schools"] == 1  # Vote on allowing religious groups in schools is no

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # republican
    elif nodes[1] or nodes[2] or nodes[3]:
        prediction = 1  # republican
    elif nodes[4]:
        prediction = 0  # democrat
    else:
        prediction = 0  # democrat

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function uses the decision tree model to predict the party affiliation based on the given features. The `nodes` list represents the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree, and the `prediction` variable is set based on the outcome of these nodes.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input dictionary `X` contains the feature values as integers (0 or 1 for yes/no questions, and 2 for yes votes). The `int(node)` conversion in the return statement is used to convert the boolean node values to integers (0 or 1) for consistency with the problem statement.
