To build a decision tree that classifies party affiliation based on the provided features (votes on various issues), I'll select the most important features and construct the tree. Since there's no specific data or weights given for the importance of each feature, I will make an educated selection based on general relevance to political party affiliations.

Selected Features:

1. Vote on aid to El Salvador (yes / no) - This issue can be seen as a reflection of foreign policy stance and military intervention views.
2. Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (yes / no) - Reflects views on separation of church and state, and social issues.
3. Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes / no) - Indicates stance on arms control and space militarization.
4. Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no) - Another foreign policy issue that can reflect interventionist vs. non-interventionist views.

Decision Tree:

|--- Vote on aid to El Salvador (yes)
||--- Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (yes)
|||--- class: Republican
||--- Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (no)
|||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes)
||||--- class: Democrat
||||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban (no)
|||||--- class: Republican
|--- Vote on aid to El Salvador (no)
||--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes)
|||--- class: Republican
||--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (no)
|||--- class: Democrat

This decision tree is based on the assumption that votes on certain issues can generally align with party ideologies. For instance, Republicans are often associated with a stronger stance on military intervention and conservative social values, while Democrats tend to support more progressive social policies and may be less likely to favor military interventions.

Please note, this is a simplified example. Real-world applications would require actual voting data and potentially more complex decision trees or the use of other machine learning algorithms for accurate classification.

Here's the Python function based on the decision tree constructed earlier. The `predict` function takes a dictionary of features (`X`) as input and returns a single prediction (party affiliation) along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Define the thresholds for each feature
    threshold_el_salvador = 2  # Vote on aid to El Salvador (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    threshold_religious_groups = 2  # Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    threshold_anti_satellite_test_ban = 2  # Vote on anti-satellite test ban (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    threshold_aid_to_nicaraguan_contras = 2  # Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (2 = yes, 1 = no)

    # Evaluate the conditions for each inner node
    nodes = [None] * 4
    nodes[0] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == threshold_el_salvador
    nodes[1] = X["religious-groups-in-schools"] == threshold_religious_groups
    nodes[2] = X["anti-satellite-test-ban"] == threshold_anti_satellite_test_ban
    nodes[3] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == threshold_aid_to_nicaraguan_contras

    # Traverse the decision tree based on the conditions
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[2] == True:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            elif nodes[2] == False:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    # Convert boolean values in the nodes list to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

Example usage:

```python
X = {
    "el-salvador-adi": 2,
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 2,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 1,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Party affiliation (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # List of boolean values representing the inner nodes
```
