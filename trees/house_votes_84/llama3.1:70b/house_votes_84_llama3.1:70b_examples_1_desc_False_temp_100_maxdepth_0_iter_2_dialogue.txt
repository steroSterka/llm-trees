To build a decision tree that classifies party affiliation based on the provided features (votes on various issues), I'll select the most important features and construct the tree. Since there's no specific data or weights given for the importance of each feature, I will make an educated selection based on general relevance to political party affiliations.

Selected Features:

1. Vote on aid to El Salvador (yes / no) - This issue can be seen as a reflection of foreign policy stance and military intervention views.
2. Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (yes / no) - Reflects views on separation of church and state, and social issues.
3. Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes / no) - Indicates stance on arms control and space militarization.
4. Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no) - Another foreign policy issue that can reflect interventionist vs. non-interventionist views.

Decision Tree:

|--- Vote on aid to El Salvador (yes)
||--- Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (yes)
|||--- class: Republican
||--- Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (no)
|||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes)
||||--- class: Democrat
||||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban (no)
|||||--- class: Republican
|--- Vote on aid to El Salvador (no)
||--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes)
|||--- class: Republican
||--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (no)
|||--- class: Democrat

This decision tree is based on the assumption that votes on certain issues can generally align with party ideologies. For instance, Republicans are often associated with a stronger stance on military intervention and conservative social values, while Democrats tend to support more progressive social policies and may be less likely to favor military interventions.

Please note, this is a simplified example. Real-world applications would require actual voting data and potentially more complex decision trees or the use of other machine learning algorithms for accurate classification.
=======
Based on the features you provided, I will induce a decision tree classifier using the most important features to classify party affiliation as either Democrat or Republican.

After analyzing the features, I found that some votes are more informative than others in distinguishing between Democrats and Republicans. Here is the induced decision tree:

|--- Vote on MX missile (yes / no)
||--- yes
|||--- class: Republican
||--- no
|||--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no)
||||--- yes
|||||--- class: Republican
||||--- no
|||||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes / no)
||||||--- yes
|||||||--- class: Democrat
||||||--- no
|||||||--- class: Republican

This decision tree uses three features to classify party affiliation:

1. Vote on MX missile: This vote is a strong indicator of party affiliation, with Republicans more likely to support the MX missile and Democrats opposing it.
2. Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras: If the legislator voted against the MX missile, their vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras becomes a deciding factor. Republicans tend to support aid to the contras, while Democrats oppose it.
3. Vote on anti-satellite test ban: If the legislator voted against both the MX missile and aid to Nicaraguan contras, their vote on the anti-satellite test ban determines their party affiliation. Democrats tend to support the ban, while Republicans oppose it.

Note that this decision tree is not exhaustive, and there may be other features that could improve its accuracy. Additionally, the tree's performance may vary depending on the specific dataset used for training and testing.

Here's the Python function based on the decision tree constructed earlier. The `predict` function takes a dictionary of features (`X`) as input and returns a single prediction (party affiliation) along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Define the thresholds for each feature
    threshold_el_salvador = 2  # Vote on aid to El Salvador (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    threshold_religious_groups = 2  # Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    threshold_anti_satellite_test_ban = 2  # Vote on anti-satellite test ban (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    threshold_aid_to_nicaraguan_contras = 2  # Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (2 = yes, 1 = no)

    # Evaluate the conditions for each inner node
    nodes = [None] * 4
    nodes[0] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == threshold_el_salvador
    nodes[1] = X["religious-groups-in-schools"] == threshold_religious_groups
    nodes[2] = X["anti-satellite-test-ban"] == threshold_anti_satellite_test_ban
    nodes[3] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == threshold_aid_to_nicaraguan_contras

    # Traverse the decision tree based on the conditions
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[2] == True:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            elif nodes[2] == False:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    # Convert boolean values in the nodes list to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

Example usage:

```python
X = {
    "el-salvador-adi": 2,
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 2,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 1,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Party affiliation (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # List of boolean values representing the inner nodes
```
=======
Here is the Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes for the decision tree model based on the given features and target variable.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["mx-missile"] == 2  # Vote on MX missile is yes
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2  # Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is yes
    nodes[2] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2  # Vote on aid to El Salvador is yes
    nodes[3] = X["immigration"] == 2  # Vote on immigration is yes
    nodes[4] = X["religious-groups-in-schools"] == 1  # Vote on allowing religious groups in schools is no

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # republican
    elif nodes[1] or nodes[2] or nodes[3]:
        prediction = 1  # republican
    elif nodes[4]:
        prediction = 0  # democrat
    else:
        prediction = 0  # democrat

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function uses the decision tree model to predict the party affiliation based on the given features. The `nodes` list represents the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree, and the `prediction` variable is set based on the outcome of these nodes.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input dictionary `X` contains the feature values as integers (0 or 1 for yes/no questions, and 2 for yes votes). The `int(node)` conversion in the return statement is used to convert the boolean node values to integers (0 or 1) for consistency with the problem statement.
