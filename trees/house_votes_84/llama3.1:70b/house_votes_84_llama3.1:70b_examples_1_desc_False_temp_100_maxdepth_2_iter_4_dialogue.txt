Based on the provided features, I will build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 to classify party affiliation (Democrat or Republican). Since the features are categorical (yes/no votes), we can treat them as binary variables.

Using the most important features (i.e., those that contribute most to the classification accuracy), I built the following decision tree:

|--- Vote on physician fee freeze (yes / no)
||--- yes
|||--- class: Democrat
||--- no
|||--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no)
||||--- yes
|||||--- class: Republican
||||--- no
|||||--- class: Democrat

Here's a brief explanation of the decision tree:

1. The first split is based on the vote on physician fee freeze. If the senator voted "yes", they are likely to be a Democrat.
2. If the senator voted "no" on physician fee freeze, we further examine their vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras. If they voted "yes" on this issue, they are likely to be a Republican.

The decision tree uses only two features out of 16 available features, as the remaining features do not contribute significantly to the classification accuracy. This is a common phenomenon in decision trees, where a subset of the most informative features can lead to good classification results.

Note that this decision tree is not unique and may vary depending on the specific data used for training and the optimization algorithm employed. However, this tree represents one possible interpretation of the relationships between the features and party affiliation.

Here is the Python function that represents the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return int(prediction), [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values as input and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the predicted class label (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican). The second element is a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.

Note that I used `int(prediction)` to convert the prediction to an integer, since the target variable is coded as 0/1. Similarly, I used `[int(node) for node in nodes]` to convert the boolean values in the `nodes` list to integers (0/1).
