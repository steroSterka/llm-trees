Based on the provided features, I'll build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 to classify party affiliation as Democrat or Republican. Here's the resulting tree:

|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no)
||--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras: yes
|||--- class: Republican
||--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras: no
|||--- Vote on physician fee freeze (yes / no)
||||--- Vote on physician fee freeze: yes
|||||--- class: Democrat
||||--- Vote on physician fee freeze: no
|||||--- class: Republican

This decision tree suggests that the most important features for predicting party affiliation are:

1. Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no)
2. Vote on physician fee freeze (yes / no)

The tree works as follows:

* If a senator voted in favor of aid to Nicaraguan contras, they are likely to be Republican.
* If a senator opposed aid to Nicaraguan contras, their vote on the physician fee freeze is used to further classify them. Those who supported the freeze are likely Democrats, while those who opposed it are likely Republicans.

Note that this decision tree has a maximum depth of 2, as requested. However, keep in mind that this is a simplified model and may not capture all the complexities of party affiliation.

Here is the Python function that represents the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2
    nodes[1] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the feature values as input. The decision tree is represented by two inner nodes (`nodes[0]` and `nodes[1]`) that correspond to the conditions in the decision tree.

The first node checks whether the senator voted in favor of aid to Nicaraguan contras (`aid-to-nicaraguan-contras` == 2). If this condition is true, the function predicts a Republican affiliation (target value = 1).

If the condition is false, the second node checks whether the senator voted in favor of physician fee freeze (`physician-fee-freeze` == 2). If this condition is true, the function predicts a Democratic affiliation (target value = 0). Otherwise, it predicts a Republican affiliation.

The function returns the predicted target value and the values of the two inner nodes.
