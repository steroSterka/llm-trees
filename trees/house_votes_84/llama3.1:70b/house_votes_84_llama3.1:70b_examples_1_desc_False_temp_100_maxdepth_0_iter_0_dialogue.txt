Based on the provided features, I'll build a decision tree classifier using the most important features to classify party affiliation as Democrat or Republican.

After analyzing the features, here's the induced decision tree:

|--- Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (yes / no)
||--- yes
|||--- class: Democrat
||--- no
|||--- Vote on aid to El Salvador (yes / no)
||||--- yes
|||||--- class: Republican
||||--- no
|||||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes / no)
||||||--- yes
|||||||--- class: Democrat
||||||--- no
|||||||--- class: Republican

Here's a brief explanation of the tree:

1. The first feature is "Vote on adoption of the budget resolution." If the vote is "yes," it's likely to be a Democrat.
2. If the vote is "no," we move to the next feature, which is "Vote on aid to El Salvador."
3. A "yes" vote on this issue suggests Republican affiliation.
4. If the vote on El Salvador is "no," we consider the "Vote on anti-satellite test ban." A "yes" vote here indicates Democrat affiliation, while a "no" vote suggests Republican.

Note that this decision tree uses only three features to classify party affiliation. Other features may also be relevant but were not included in this simplified tree.

Keep in mind that this is just one possible way to build a decision tree using these features. Different algorithms or techniques might produce different trees, and the performance of this tree on unseen data should be evaluated to ensure its accuracy.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2
    
    # Node 1: Vote on aid to El Salvador (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[1] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2
    
    # Node 2: Vote on anti-satellite test ban (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[2] = X["anti-satellite-test-ban"] == 2

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 1
                
    return prediction, nodes
```

In this function, we use the provided features to make a prediction about the party affiliation (Republican or Democrat) of an individual. The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.

Note that I assumed the encoding for the target variable is 1 = Republican and 0 = Democrat. If this is not correct, please let me know and I will adjust the function accordingly.
