To induce a decision tree classifier for party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) based on the provided features, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Selecting the Most Important Features**: We need to identify which votes are most indicative of party affiliation. Given the nature of the data (yes/no votes), we can use techniques like mutual information or recursive feature elimination to find the most informative features. However, without specific data on how each vote correlates with party affiliation, we'll proceed conceptually.

2. **Building the Decision Tree**:
    - The decision tree will recursively partition the data based on the votes.
    - Each internal node represents a feature (vote) used for splitting.
    - Each leaf node represents the predicted class label (Democrat or Republican).

Given the lack of specific data, let's hypothetically select features that are typically polarizing and could serve as strong indicators of party affiliation in the U.S. context:
- **Vote on aid to El Salvador**: Historically, votes on military aid have been divisive along party lines.
- **Vote on allowing religious groups in schools**: This issue touches on separation of church and state, often a partisan divide.
- **Vote on anti-satellite test ban**: Defense spending and arms control have historically been areas of disagreement between the parties.

### Hypothetical Decision Tree

|--- Vote on aid to El Salvador (yes / no)
||--- yes
|||--- Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (yes / no)
||||--- yes
|||||--- class: Republican
||||--- no
|||||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes / no)
||||||--- yes
|||||||--- class: Democrat
||||||--- no
|||||||--- class: Republican
||--- no
|||--- Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (yes / no)
||||--- yes
|||||--- class: Republican
||||--- no
|||||--- Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes / no)
||||||--- yes
|||||||--- class: Democrat
||||||--- no
|||||||--- class: Republican

### Explanation:
- **Root Node**: The decision tree starts by considering the vote on aid to El Salvador, as it's a polarizing issue that might strongly indicate party affiliation.
- **Internal Nodes**: Further splits are based on votes that could distinguish between Democrats and Republicans within each subset of the data. For example, allowing religious groups in schools is used as it often aligns with conservative (Republican) values.
- **Leaf Nodes**: Each terminal node predicts the party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) based on the combination of votes.

### Note:
This decision tree is highly speculative and simplifies the complexities of U.S. political issues and party affiliations. Real-world application would require detailed analysis of voting records, potentially incorporating additional factors like demographic data, to build an accurate model. The choice of features (votes) here is intended for illustrative purposes rather than predictive accuracy.

Here is a Python function that implements the decision tree based on the provided features and target variable. This function takes a dictionary `X` as input where keys are feature names and values are corresponding feature values.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) based on voting history.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing voting history for an individual.
             Keys: 'handicapped-infants', 'water-project-cost-sharing', 
                   'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution', 'physician-fee-freeze', 
                   'el-salvador-adi', 'religious-groups-in-schools', 
                   'anti-satellite-test-ban', 'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras', 
                   'mx-missile', 'immigration', 'synfuels-corporation-cutback', 
                   'education-spending', 'superfund-right-to-sue', 'crime', 
                   'duty-free-exports', 'export-administration-act-south-africa'
             Values: 1 (no) or 2 (yes)
    
    Returns:
    prediction (int): Predicted party affiliation. 0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican.
    nodes (list): List of boolean values representing the inner nodes of the decision tree.
                  1 if condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise.
    """
    # Initialize nodes list with None
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Vote on aid to El Salvador
    nodes[0] = X['el-salvador-adi'] == 2
    
    # Node 1: Vote on allowing religious groups in schools
    nodes[1] = X['religious-groups-in-schools'] == 2
    
    # Node 2: Vote on anti-satellite test ban
    nodes[2] = X['anti-satellite-test-ban'] == 2
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    
    # Convert boolean values in nodes list to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
voting_history = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 2,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 1,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(voting_history)
print(f"Predicted party affiliation: {prediction}")
print(f"Inner nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this code:

*   We define a function `predict` that takes a dictionary `X` containing voting history as input.
*   The decision tree logic is implemented using conditional statements based on the values of specific votes.
*   The `nodes` list stores boolean values representing the inner nodes of the decision tree, which are converted to integers (1 for True, 0 for False) before being returned along with the predicted party affiliation.
