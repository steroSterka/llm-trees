To induce a decision tree classifier for party affiliation based on the given features, we first need to understand that this problem involves classifying individuals as either Democrats or Republicans based on their votes on various issues. The example provided earlier shows how a decision tree can be structured based on physical attributes of flowers to classify them into different species. Similarly, we will use the voting patterns on several issues to classify party affiliation.

Given the nature of the features (yes/no votes on various legislative issues), it's clear that this is a classification problem where each feature represents a vote on a specific issue, and the target variable is the party affiliation (Democrat or Republican).

Here's how we might construct a simplified decision tree based on the most important features. Note that in real-world scenarios, we would typically use data analysis techniques (such as information gain or Gini impurity) to determine which features are most important for splitting the data. However, without access to specific voting data and outcomes, I'll provide a conceptual example of how such a decision tree might look:

1. **Start with the Root Node:** The root node represents all votes.
   
2. **First Split:** Choose the feature that best separates Democrats from Republicans based on historical voting patterns or importance. For instance, if "Vote on aid to El Salvador" is a highly divisive issue along party lines (hypothetically, let's say Republicans were more likely to vote yes and Democrats no), this could be our first split.
   - **Yes** on aid to El Salvador might lean towards Republican.
   - **No** on aid to El Salvador might lean towards Democrat.

3. **Second Split for Each Branch:** For each branch from the first split, we need another feature that further separates the parties among those who voted yes or no on the first issue.
   - **For Yes on El Salvador:**
     - If "Vote on MX missile" is also a strong indicator (with Republicans more likely to vote yes), this could be the next split. 
       - **Yes** on MX missile: Likely Republican
       - **No** on MX missile: Could go either way, needs further splitting.
   - **For No on El Salvador:**
     - If "Vote on education spending" is a distinguishing feature (with Democrats more likely to vote yes), this could be the next split.
       - **Yes** on education spending: Likely Democrat
       - **No** on education spending: Could go either way, needs further splitting.

4. **Continue Splitting:** Continue this process with each branch until all instances are classified as either Democrat or Republican, or until no more features provide significant information for further splits.

Here's a simplified representation of what the decision tree might look like based on these hypothetical splits:

```
|--- Vote on aid to El Salvador
||--- Yes
|||--- Vote on MX missile
||||--- Yes: Likely Republican
||||--- No: 
|||||--- Vote on immigration
||||||--- Yes: Likely Republican
||||||--- No: Likely Democrat
||--- No
|||--- Vote on education spending
||||--- Yes: Likely Democrat
||||--- No: 
|||||--- Vote on crime
||||||--- Yes: Likely Republican
||||||--- No: Likely Democrat
```

This example is highly simplified and speculative. In practice, constructing a decision tree would involve:
- Using real voting data to determine which issues are most divisive along party lines.
- Applying algorithms (like ID3, C4.5, or CART) that can handle categorical data and compute the best splits based on metrics like information gain, Gini index, or variance reduction.
- Possibly dealing with missing values or inconsistent voting patterns.

Remember, the actual decision tree would depend heavily on the specifics of the voting data used for its construction.

Here's a Python function representing the decision tree based on the provided features and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes with None values
    nodes = 5 * [None]

    # Calculate node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2  # Vote for aid to El Salvador
    nodes[1] = X["mx-missile"] == 2      # Vote for MX missile
    nodes[2] = X["education-spending"] == 1  # Vote against education spending
    nodes[3] = X["crime"] == 2           # Vote for crime bill
    nodes[4] = X["religious-groups-in-schools"] == 2  # Vote for religious groups in schools

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Likely Republican
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Likely Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Likely Democrat
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Likely Democrat
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Likely Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Likely Democrat

    # Convert boolean node values to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

In this decision tree, the conditions are based on the voting patterns of the individuals. The features used are:
- `el-salvador-adi`: Vote on aid to El Salvador (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- `mx-missile`: Vote on MX missile (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- `education-spending`: Vote on education spending (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- `crime`: Vote on crime (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- `religious-groups-in-schools`: Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (2 = yes, 1 = no)

The target variable is the party affiliation (`target`), with 1 indicating Republican and 0 indicating Democrat. The decision tree predicts the party affiliation based on these voting patterns.

Note that this decision tree is a simplified representation and might not accurately reflect real-world voting patterns or party affiliations. In practice, you would need to train a model using actual data to make accurate predictions.
