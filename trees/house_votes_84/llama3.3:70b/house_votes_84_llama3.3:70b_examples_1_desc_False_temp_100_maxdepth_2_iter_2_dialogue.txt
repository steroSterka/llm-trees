To build a decision tree classifier for party affiliation based on the provided features, we first need to determine which features are most important. However, since this is a text-based interaction and not an actual data analysis environment, I'll guide you through a conceptual approach to building such a tree.

Given the context of voting records as features, it's crucial to note that the importance of each feature (vote on specific issues) can vary greatly depending on the dataset's specifics, such as how consistently members of each party voted on these issues. 

For simplicity and without access to actual data, I'll create a hypothetical decision tree based on two features: "Vote on aid to El Salvador" and "Vote on anti-satellite test ban." These are chosen arbitrarily for demonstration purposes.

**Decision Tree:**

1. **Root Node:** Vote on aid to El Salvador
   - **Condition:** Yes
     - **Left Child:** Vote on anti-satellite test ban
       - **Condition:** No
         - **Class:** Republican (hypothetical assumption that Republicans were more likely to vote no on this issue)
       - **Condition:** Yes
         - **Class:** Democrat (assuming Democrats might have been more divided but for simplicity, we assign yes as indicative of a Democrat)
   - **Condition:** No
     - **Right Child:** Direct classification based on the feature importance and without further splitting due to our depth limit.
       - **Class:** Republican (assuming that a no vote here is strongly indicative of Republican affiliation in this simplified model)

This decision tree has a maximum depth of 2, as requested. The choice of "Vote on aid to El Salvador" as the root node and "Vote on anti-satellite test ban" for further differentiation is arbitrary without actual data analysis.

**Actual Implementation:**

In practice, you would use a machine learning library (like scikit-learn in Python) to train a DecisionTreeClassifier on your dataset. The process involves:

1. **Data Preparation:** Ensure your features are numeric or appropriately encoded (e.g., yes/no votes could be encoded as 0/1).
2. **Feature Selection:** Use methods like mutual information, correlation analysis, or recursive feature elimination to identify the most relevant features.
3. **Model Training:** Train a DecisionTreeClassifier with specified parameters (e.g., `max_depth=2`) on your dataset.

Example Python code snippet using scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Assuming X is your feature matrix and y is the target vector
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate your model
accuracy = clf.score(X_test, y_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

Remember, this example is highly simplified and actual implementation details can vary based on the specifics of your dataset and analysis goals.

Based on the provided features and target variable, I will create a decision tree function with a maximum depth of 2. The function will use two features: 'el-salvador-adi' and 'anti-satellite-test-ban'. 

Here is the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the party affiliation based on voting records.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the voting records.
              Keys: 'handicapped-infants', 'water-project-cost-sharing', 
                    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution', 'physician-fee-freeze', 
                    'el-salvador-adi', 'religious-groups-in-schools', 
                    'anti-satellite-test-ban', 'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras', 
                    'mx-missile', 'immigration', 'synfuels-corporation-cutback', 
                    'education-spending', 'superfund-right-to-sue', 'crime', 
                    'duty-free-exports', 'export-administration-act-south-africa'

    Returns:
    prediction (int): The predicted party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat)
    nodes (list): A list of boolean values representing the inner nodes
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Node 0: Check if the vote on aid to El Salvador is yes (2)
    nodes[0] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2
    
    # Node 1: Check if the vote on anti-satellite test ban is no (1)
    nodes[1] = X["anti-satellite-test-ban"] == 1
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        # If aid to El Salvador is yes, check the vote on anti-satellite test ban
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # democrat
    else:
        # If aid to El Salvador is no, predict democrat
        prediction = 0
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the voting records as input and returns the predicted party affiliation (`prediction`) and a list of boolean values representing the inner nodes (`nodes`). The decision tree logic is based on two features: 'el-salvador-adi' and 'anti-satellite-test-ban'. If the vote on aid to El Salvador is yes, it checks the vote on anti-satellite test ban to determine the party affiliation. Otherwise, it predicts democrat.
