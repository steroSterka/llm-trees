To induce a decision tree classifier with the given features and a maximum depth of 2, we need to first determine which features are most important for classifying party affiliation (Democrat or Republican). Since we don't have actual data to perform feature selection or training, I'll guide you through a conceptual approach based on common practices in machine learning.

### Step 1: Feature Importance
In real scenarios, techniques like mutual information, recursive feature elimination, or permutation importance from random forests can help determine the most crucial features. For simplicity and without access to specific voting data, we might hypothesize that certain votes are more polarizing along party lines. For example:
- Vote on aid to El Salvador (yes / no)
- Vote on MX missile (yes / no)
- Vote on immigration (yes / no)

These could potentially be strong indicators of party affiliation due to their historical context and typical partisan divides.

### Step 2: Building the Decision Tree
Given our hypothetical most important features, we'll construct a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. This means we can only have one layer of splits (i.e., decisions based on feature values) before making predictions.

Let's assume:
- The vote on aid to El Salvador is highly indicative of party affiliation.
- The vote on MX missile acts as a secondary differentiator, especially among those who voted similarly on the first issue.

### Example Decision Tree

1. **Root Node**: Vote on aid to El Salvador (yes / no)
   - If yes:
     - **Left Child**: Predict Democrat
   - If no:
     - **Right Child**: Vote on MX missile (yes / no)
       - If yes: Predict Republican
       - If no: Predict Democrat

This simplified example assumes voting patterns that may not reflect real-world complexities or nuances. In actuality, decision trees are often more complex and require training data to accurately determine splits and predictions.

### Python Example with Scikit-learn
For a real dataset, you could use the following Python code as a starting point:

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'df' is your DataFrame containing features and target variable
X = df.drop('party_affiliation', axis=1)  # Features
y = df['party_affiliation']  # Target variable

# Split dataset into training set and test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=1)

# Create Decision Tree classifier with max depth of 2
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2, random_state=1)

# Train the model using the training sets
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Print feature importances
for i in range(len(clf.feature_importances_)):
    print(f"Feature {X.columns[i]}, Importance: {clf.feature_importances_[i]}")

# Use the trained classifier to make predictions on test data
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
```

Remember, this is a conceptual example. Real-world application requires actual voting data and might involve more complex feature engineering and model tuning for accurate predictions.

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree based on the provided features and target variable. This function takes in a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple with the predicted party affiliation (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each inner node.

```python
def predict_party_affiliation(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Node 0: Vote on aid to El Salvador
    nodes[0] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2
    
    # If yes on el-salvador-adi, then check the vote on MX missile
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Vote on MX missile
        nodes[1] = X["mx-missile"] == 2
        # Predict Republican if yes on both, otherwise predict Democrat
        prediction = 1 if nodes[1] else 0
    else:
        # If no on el-salvador-adi, then predict Democrat regardless of MX missile vote
        prediction = 0
        # Set Node 1 to False since it's not used in this branch
        nodes[1] = False
    
    # Convert boolean node values to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X = {
    "handicapped-infants": 2,
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 2,
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 2,
    "physician-fee-freeze": 2,
    "el-salvador-adi": 2,  # Yes on aid to El Salvador
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 2,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 1,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 2,
    "mx-missile": 2,  # Yes on MX missile
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 1,
    "education-spending": 2,
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 2,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty-free-exports": 1,
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict_party_affiliation(X)
print("Predicted party affiliation:", prediction)  # 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat
print("Node values:", nodes)  # [1, 1] if both conditions are True, otherwise [1, 0] or [0, 0]
```

In this example, we use the votes on aid to El Salvador and MX missile as our decision criteria. If the vote is yes on both, we predict Republican; otherwise, we predict Democrat. The `nodes` list contains boolean values representing the conditions at each inner node, which are then converted to integers (1 for True, 0 for False) before being returned.
