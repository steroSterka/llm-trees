To induce a decision tree classifier based on the given features with a maximum depth of 2, we'll need to determine which features are most important for distinguishing between Democrats and Republicans. Since this is a binary classification problem (Democrat or Republican), we can use a decision tree to model the relationships between votes on various issues and party affiliation.

Given that we don't have actual data but rather feature names, I will simulate how one might approach this by selecting two of the most potentially divisive issues as the primary and secondary splits. The selection is somewhat arbitrary without specific data, but it's guided by general knowledge of historically contentious issues in U.S. politics.

Let's select:
1. **Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no)** as our first feature for splitting. This issue was highly divisive during the Cold War era and could serve as a strong indicator of party affiliation due to its geopolitical implications.
2. **Vote on crime (yes / no)** as our second feature for further splits under each branch of the first decision. Crime legislation has often been a point of contention between parties, with differing views on how to address crime effectively.

Here's a simulated decision tree:

- **Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no) <= yes**  
  |--- This suggests support for a more hawkish or interventionist foreign policy stance, which has historically been associated more with Republicans.
  ||--- **Vote on crime (yes / no) <= yes**
  |||--- Class: Republican (Support for both contra aid and stricter crime policies aligns with traditional conservative stances.)
  ||--- **Vote on crime (yes / no) > yes**  
  |||--- This could indicate a more nuanced position, possibly a Democrat who supported some aspects of the crime bill but was opposed to aiding the contras.
  |||--- Class: Democrat

- **Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no) > yes**  
  |--- Suggests opposition to U.S. involvement in Nicaragua, which aligns more with Democratic or liberal foreign policy views.
  ||--- **Vote on crime (yes / no) <= yes**
  |||--- This might indicate a Democrat who supports stricter crime policies but opposes interventionist foreign policies.
  |||--- Class: Democrat
  ||--- **Vote on crime (yes / no) > yes**  
  |||--- Indicates opposition to both the contras and possibly stricter crime measures, aligning with more liberal stances.
  |||--- Class: Democrat

This decision tree is a highly simplified model. In reality, party affiliation would depend on a complex interplay of many issues, and actual voting data would be necessary to train an accurate classifier. The choice of features (votes on specific bills) in this example is based on general knowledge of political divides rather than empirical analysis of voting patterns.

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree based on the provided features and target variable. This function takes in a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple with the predicted party affiliation (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the party affiliation based on the given features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values.
        - handicapped-infants: Vote on the issue of handicapped infants (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - water-project-cost-sharing: Vote on water project cost sharing (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - adoption-of-the-budget-resolution: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - physician-fee-freeze: Vote on physician fee freeze (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - el-salvador-adi: Vote on aid to El Salvador (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - religious-groups-in-schools: Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - anti-satellite-test-ban: Vote on anti-satellite test ban (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - aid-to-nicaraguan-contras: Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - mx-missile: Vote on MX missile (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - immigration: Vote on immigration (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - synfuels-corporation-cutback: Vote on synfuels corporation cutback (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - education-spending: Vote on education spending (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - superfund-right-to-sue: Vote on superfund right to sue (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - crime: Vote on crime (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - duty-free-exports: Vote on duty-free exports (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - export-administration-act-south-africa: Vote on Export Administration Act - South Africa (2 = yes, 1 = no)

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the predicted party affiliation (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """

    # Initialize nodes with None
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Node 1: Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras
    nodes[0] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2  # yes

    # Node 2: Vote on crime
    nodes[1] = X["crime"] == 2  # yes

    # Prediction based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:  # Supported aid to Nicaraguan contras
        if nodes[1]:  # Supported stricter crime policies
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican (assuming support for contras is a stronger indicator)
    else:  # Did not support aid to Nicaraguan contras
        if nodes[1]:  # Supported stricter crime policies
            prediction = 0  # Democrat (assuming opposition to contras and support for crime policies)
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    # Convert boolean nodes to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function uses the votes on aid to Nicaraguan contras and crime as the primary and secondary splits, respectively. The predicted party affiliation is based on these two features. Note that this is a simplified model and actual voting patterns may be more complex.

To use this function, create a dictionary `X` with the feature values and call the `predict` function:

```python
X = {
    "handicapped-infants": 2,
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 1,
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 2,
    "physician-fee-freeze": 1,
    "el-salvador-adi": 2,
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 1,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 2,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 2,
    "mx-missile": 1,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 1,
    "education-spending": 2,
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty-free-exports": 1,
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Predicted party affiliation:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```
