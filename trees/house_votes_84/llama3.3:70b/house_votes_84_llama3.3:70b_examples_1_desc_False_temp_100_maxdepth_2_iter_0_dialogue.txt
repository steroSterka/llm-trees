To induce a decision tree classifier with the given features and classify party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) with a maximum depth of 2, we need to determine the most important features from the provided list. However, without specific data on how each feature correlates with the party affiliations, I'll proceed conceptually.

The decision tree should ideally start by splitting based on the feature that best separates Democrats from Republicans at the root node (depth 0). For simplicity and due to the lack of actual voting data in your query, let's hypothetically choose "Vote on aid to El Salvador" as a critical issue that might significantly differentiate between Democrat and Republican votes, considering historical contexts where such issues have been divisive.

At depth 1, we need another feature to further differentiate or confirm the classification. Let's hypothesize "Vote on physician fee freeze" could be a significant differentiator due to its relevance to healthcare policy, an area often seeing partisan divides.

Given these selections and without actual data to train a model, here's a conceptual decision tree:

- **Root Node (Depth 0):** Vote on aid to El Salvador
    - **Left Child (Depth 1):** Vote on aid to El Salvador = Yes
        - **Grandchild (Depth 2):** If Vote on physician fee freeze = Yes, then class: Democrat. Else if Vote on physician fee freeze = No, then this path could potentially lead to a Republican classification or require further differentiation not possible within our depth limit.
    - **Right Child (Depth 1):** Vote on aid to El Salvador = No
        - **Grandchild (Depth 2):** If Vote on physician fee freeze = Yes, this might lean towards Democrat but is less clear without data. If Vote on physician fee freeze = No, then class: Republican.

This tree is highly speculative and based on hypothetical assumptions about the voting patterns of Democrats and Republicans on these issues. In reality, to build an accurate decision tree, you would need a dataset that includes the votes of individual congress members on these issues along with their party affiliations. With such data, you could use techniques like information gain or Gini impurity to determine the most informative features for splitting at each node.

Here's a more formal representation based on our hypothetical:

```
|--- Vote on aid to El Salvador = Yes
||--- Vote on physician fee freeze = Yes
|||--- class: Democrat
||--- Vote on physician fee freeze = No
|||--- (Further differentiation needed or potentially Republican)
|--- Vote on aid to El Salvador = No
||--- Vote on physician fee freeze = Yes
|||--- (Potentially Democrat, but less clear without data)
||--- Vote on physician fee freeze = No
|||--- class: Republican
```

Please note, this decision tree is a conceptual example rather than an actual model trained on data. For accurate predictions, training a model with real voting data and analyzing feature importance would be necessary.

Based on the provided features and target variable, here's a Python function that implements a decision tree of depth 2 to predict party affiliation:

```python
def predict_party_affiliation(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts party affiliation based on voting history.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): Dictionary containing voting history features.
    
    Returns:
    prediction (int): Predicted party affiliation (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican).
    nodes (list): List of boolean values representing the truth values of inner nodes.
    """
    # Initialize nodes list to store truth values of inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if vote on aid to El Salvador is yes (2)
    nodes[0] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2
    
    # Node 1: Check if vote on physician fee freeze is yes (2) given the outcome of node 0
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2
    else:
        nodes[1] = not (X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2)
    
    # Make prediction based on nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    # Convert boolean values in nodes to integers (True -> 1, False -> 0)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
voting_history = {
    "handicapped-infants": 2,
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 2,
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 1,
    "physician-fee-freeze": 2,
    "el-salvador-adi": 2,
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 1,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 2,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 1,
    "mx-missile": 2,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 2,
    "education-spending": 1,
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 2,
    "crime": 1,
    "duty-free-exports": 2,
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict_party_affiliation(voting_history)
print("Predicted party affiliation:", prediction)
print("Inner node truth values:", nodes)

```

This code defines a function `predict_party_affiliation` that takes a dictionary of voting history features as input and returns the predicted party affiliation along with the truth values of the inner nodes. The decision tree is based on two nodes: the first checks if the vote on aid to El Salvador is yes, and the second checks if the vote on physician fee freeze is yes given the outcome of the first node. The prediction is made based on the combination of these two nodes.
