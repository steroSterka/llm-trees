Based on the provided features, I'll induce a decision tree classifier to predict party affiliation (Democrat or Republican). Since there are 17 features, I'll use a subset of the most important ones to build the tree. Here's the decision tree:

|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no)
    |--- yes
        |--- class: Republican
    |--- no
        |--- Vote on MX missile (yes / no)
            |--- yes
                |--- class: Republican
            |--- no
                |--- Vote on crime (yes / no)
                    |--- yes
                        |--- class: Republican
                    |--- no
                        |--- class: Democrat

The decision tree uses the following features:

1. Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no): This feature is used as the root node, as it seems to be a strong indicator of party affiliation.
2. Vote on MX missile (yes / no): If the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is "no", this feature is used to further distinguish between parties.
3. Vote on crime (yes / no): If the vote on MX missile is "no", this feature is used to make the final classification.

The tree suggests that:

* Voting "yes" on aid to Nicaraguan contras or voting "yes" on the MX missile are strong indicators of being a Republican.
* Voting "no" on aid to Nicaraguan contras, voting "no" on the MX missile, and voting "no" on crime are indicators of being a Democrat.

Note that this is a simplified decision tree and may not capture all the complexities of party affiliation. The actual decision-making process may involve more features and interactions between them.

Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict party affiliation based on voting history.

    Args:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the features.
        - handicapped-infants: Vote on the issue of handicapped infants (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - water-project-cost-sharing: Vote on water project cost sharing (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - adoption-of-the-budget-resolution: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - physician-fee-freeze: Vote on physician fee freeze (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - el-salvador-adi: Vote on aid to El Salvador (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - religious-groups-in-schools: Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - anti-satellite-test-ban: Vote on anti-satellite test ban (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - aid-to-nicaraguan-contras: Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - mx-missile: Vote on MX missile (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - immigration: Vote on immigration (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - synfuels-corporation-cutback: Vote on synfuels corporation cutback (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - education-spending: Vote on education spending (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - superfund-right-to-sue: Vote on superfund right to sue (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - crime: Vote on crime (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - duty-free-exports: Vote on duty-free exports (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - export-administration-act-south-africa: Vote on Export Administration Act - South Africa (2 = yes, 1 = no)

    Returns:
    prediction (int): Predicted party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat)
    nodes (list): A list of boolean values representing the inner nodes

    return prediction, nodes

This function implements the decision tree using the features provided. The `predict` function takes a dictionary `X` as input and returns a tuple containing the predicted party affiliation (`prediction`) and a list of boolean values representing the inner nodes (`nodes`). The example usage demonstrates how to call the `predict` function with a sample input dictionary `X`.
