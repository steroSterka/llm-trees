To induce a decision tree classifier based on the provided features for predicting party affiliation (Democrat or Republican), we need to analyze the votes on various issues and determine which ones are most indicative of party affiliation. Given the nature of the data, it's clear that certain issues would be more polarizing between Democrats and Republicans.

Without specific data on how individual politicians voted on these issues and their corresponding party affiliations, I'll create a hypothetical decision tree based on general assumptions about party positions on these topics. Note that in real-world scenarios, you would use actual voting data to train the model.

1. **Vote on aid to El Salvador (yes / no)**: This issue could be divisive, with Republicans potentially more likely to support military or authoritarian interventions and Democrats possibly opposing them due to humanitarian concerns.
   
2. **Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (yes / no)**: Generally, Republicans might be more in favor of this due to their broader stance on religious freedom and school choice, while Democrats could be more cautious due to separation of church and state concerns.

3. **Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes / no)**: Democrats might be more inclined to support arms control measures like an anti-satellite test ban for environmental and peace reasons, whereas Republicans could be more skeptical due to national security considerations.

Given these assumptions, here's a simplified decision tree:

- **Root Node**: Vote on aid to El Salvador
  - **If yes**, proceed to "Vote on allowing religious groups in schools"
    - **If yes** on allowing religious groups in schools, classify as **Republican**
    - **If no** on allowing religious groups in schools, proceed to "Vote on anti-satellite test ban"
      - **If yes** on anti-satellite test ban, classify as **Democrat**
      - **If no** on anti-satellite test ban, classify as **Republican**
  - **If no** on aid to El Salvador, proceed to "Vote on allowing religious groups in schools"
    - **If yes**, classify as **Republican**
    - **If no**, proceed to "Vote on anti-satellite test ban"
      - **If yes**, classify as **Democrat**
      - **If no**, classify as **Republican**

This decision tree simplifies complex political stances and voting behaviors into a few key issues. In reality, party affiliation can depend on a myriad of factors including economic policies, social issues, foreign policy, and more. Actual decision trees would require detailed analysis of historical voting data to accurately reflect the most predictive features for party affiliation.

**Important Note**: This example is highly hypothetical and based on broad stereotypes of political affiliations. Real-world applications would involve:
- Using actual voting records.
- Considering a wider range of issues.
- Accounting for regional and individual variations within parties.
- Employing machine learning algorithms to determine the most predictive features from the data.

The provided decision tree is intended for illustrative purposes only, demonstrating how one might construct such a tree based on assumed party positions on certain issues.

Here's how you could implement the decision tree as a Python function based on your requirements. The function will take in a dictionary `X` where keys are feature names and values are the corresponding features' values.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize list to hold truth values of inner nodes
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Vote on aid to El Salvador (el-salvador-adi)
    nodes[0] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2
    
    # Node 1: Vote on allowing religious groups in schools
    nodes[1] = X["religious-groups-in-schools"] == 2
    
    # Node 2: Vote on anti-satellite test ban
    nodes[2] = X["anti-satellite-test-ban"] == 2
    
    # Node 3: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution
    nodes[3] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
            
    # Convert boolean values in nodes list to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X = {
    "handicapped-infants": 2,
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 1,
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 2,
    "physician-fee-freeze": 1,
    "el-salvador-adi": 2,
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 2,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 1,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 1,
    "mx-missile": 1,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 1,
    "education-spending": 2,
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 2,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty-free-exports": 1,
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this code:

*   The `predict` function takes in a dictionary `X` representing the features and their values.
*   It initializes a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.
*   The decision tree logic is implemented using if-else statements based on the feature values.
*   The prediction (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and the list of node truth values are returned by the function.
*   An example usage of the `predict` function is provided with a sample dictionary `X` containing feature values.
