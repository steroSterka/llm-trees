Okay, I understand. You want me to act as a decision tree learning algorithm, using the provided voting records to classify politicians as either Democrat or Republican.  I'll attempt to build a tree based on the "most important" features, but as I'm an AI, "importance" is based on trying to create a relatively simple, accurate tree.  There's no guarantee this will perfectly match a tree created by a statistical software package, but I'll aim for something reasonable.

Since I can't *execute* code or access data to truly calculate information gain, I will use a heuristic approach, prioritizing splits that create the most balanced branches and seem intuitively relevant to party affiliation.  I'll work iteratively, making one split at a time, and showing the branches.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Data is Absent:** I don't *have* the actual voting records for a set of politicians.  I'm *inferring* how a tree might look based on the *names* of the issues. This is a significant limitation.  My choices are based on common political stances.
*   **Simplification:**  I'll aim for a relatively shallow tree to keep it manageable.  A real decision tree might be much deeper and complex.
*   **Heuristic Approach:** I will use my understanding of typical Democratic and Republican positions on these issues to guide the splits.

**Here's my attempt at building the Decision Tree:**

**Root Node: Vote on Aid to El Salvador (yes/no)**

This issue is a good starting point as it historically represented a clear divergence between the parties. Democrats were generally less inclined to provide aid to governments with questionable human rights records, while Republicans were more likely to prioritize strategic alliances.

*   **If Vote on Aid to El Salvador == 'no'**
    *   **Next Split: Vote on Education Spending (yes/no)**
        *   **If Vote on Education Spending == 'yes'**
            *   **Class: Democrat** (Likely Democrat as they typically support increased education funding)
        *   **If Vote on Education Spending == 'no'**
            *   **Next Split: Vote on Superfund Right to Sue (yes/no)**
                *   **If Vote on Superfund Right to Sue == 'yes'**
                    *   **Class: Democrat** (Strong support from Democrats for environmental regulations and citizen lawsuits)
                *   **If Vote on Superfund Right to Sue == 'no'**
                    *   **Class: Republican**

*   **If Vote on Aid to El Salvador == 'yes'**
    *   **Next Split: Vote on Crime (yes/no)**
        *   **If Vote on Crime == 'yes'**
            *   **Next Split: Vote on Duty-Free Exports (yes/no)**
                *   **If Vote on Duty-Free Exports == 'yes'**
                    *   **Class: Republican**
                *   **If Vote on Duty-Free Exports == 'no'**
                    *   **Class: Republican**
        *   **If Vote on Crime == 'no'**
            *    **Next Split: Vote on Adoption of the budget resolution (yes/no)**
                *   **If Vote on Adoption of the budget resolution == 'yes'**
                    *   **Class: Republican**
                *   **If Vote on Adoption of the budget resolution == 'no'**
                    *   **Class: Democrat**

**Tree Summary (Text Format):**

```
Vote on Aid to El Salvador:
  - No:
    - Vote on Education Spending:
      - Yes: Democrat
      - No:
        - Vote on Superfund Right to Sue:
          - Yes: Democrat
          - No: Republican
  - Yes:
    - Vote on Crime:
      - Yes:
        - Vote on Duty-Free Exports:
          - Yes: Republican
          - No: Republican
      - No:
        - Vote on Adoption of the budget resolution:
          - Yes: Republican
          - No: Democrat
```

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **Aid to El Salvador:**  Historically, a key dividing line.
*   **Education Spending:** Democrats generally favor increased funding for education.
*   **Superfund Right to Sue:**  Democrats typically support environmental regulations and allowing citizens to sue polluters.
*    **Crime:** Republicans tend to focus on law and order.
*    **Duty-Free Exports:** Republicans generally support free trade initiatives.
*   **Adoption of the budget resolution:** Republicans tend to support budget cuts.

**Important Disclaimer:**

This is a *very* simplified decision tree based on limited information and my interpretation of political stances. A real-world decision tree built on actual data would likely be much more complex and potentially different. It also assumes that these issues are the most important for distinguishing between Democrats and Republicans, which might not always be the case.
