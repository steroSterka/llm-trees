Okay, I understand.  I'll build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 to classify party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) based on the provided voting records.  Determining the *most* important features and the exact splits requires a bit of reasoning/simulating how a decision tree algorithm (like CART) would operate.  I'll base it on what I perceive as potentially highly differentiating votes, aiming for a tree that provides a reasonable separation of Democrats and Republicans, given common political stances.

**Important Considerations & Assumptions:**

*   **Gini Impurity/Information Gain:** A real decision tree algorithm would use metrics like Gini impurity or information gain to choose the best split at each node.  Since I'm doing this manually, I'm *approximating* that process based on likely separation.
*   **Common Political Divides:** I'm relying on a general understanding of how Democrats and Republicans have historically voted on these issues.
*   **Depth Limit:**  The tree will have a maximum depth of 2 (one root node, up to two child nodes each, for a total of potentially 3 leaf nodes).
*   **Data is not Provided:** I do not have actual voting data for politicians, so the split points are educated guesses.

**Decision Tree:**

```
|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes/no) <= 0
||--- Vote on education spending (yes/no) <= 0
|||--- Class: Democrat
||--- Vote on education spending (yes/no) > 0
|||--- Class: Republican
|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes/no) > 0
||--- Vote on physician fee freeze (yes/no) <= 0
|||--- Class: Republican
||--- Vote on physician fee freeze (yes/no) > 0
|||--- Class: Democrat
```

**Explanation of Splits:**

1.  **Root Split: Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes/no) <= 0**
    *   The aid to Nicaraguan Contras was a highly contentious issue. Republicans generally supported the Contras, while Democrats largely opposed funding them. This provides a good initial separation.
2.  **First Level Splits:**
    *   **If Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras <= 0:**
        *   **Vote on education spending (yes/no) <= 0**: Democrats tend to favor increased education spending, so a "no" vote here suggests a more conservative stance. This branch leads to the "Democrat" class.
        *   **Vote on education spending (yes/no) > 0**: A "yes" vote on education spending aligns with typical Democrat positioning and leads to the "Republican" class
    *   **If Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras > 0:**
        *   **Vote on physician fee freeze (yes/no) <= 0**: Republicans generally support measures to control healthcare costs, like physician fee freezes, so a "no" vote indicates leaning towards Republican and leads to "Republican".
        *   **Vote on physician fee freeze (yes/no) > 0**: A "yes" vote on physician fee freeze indicates leaning towards Democrat and leads to "Democrat".

**Important Disclaimer:**

This decision tree is based on *assumptions* and a simplified understanding of political stances. The actual performance on a real dataset would depend on the specific voting patterns in that data.  A true decision tree algorithm, trained on actual voting records, would likely produce a different (and potentially more accurate) tree.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) based on voting records
    using a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the voting records for a politician.
                   Keys should match the feature names defined in the problem description.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the predicted party affiliation (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican)
               and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
               The list will have length 2, corresponding to the two inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    nodes = [None, None]

    # Node 1: aid-to-nicaraguan-contras (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] <= 1  # Less than or equal to 1 means "no" vote

    if nodes[0]:  # If voted against aid to Nicaraguan Contras (likely Democrat)
        # Node 2: education-spending (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        nodes[1] = X['education-spending'] <= 1  # Less than or equal to 1 means "no" vote

        if nodes[1]:  # Voted against both aid and education spending (strong Democrat signal)
            prediction = 0
        else:  # Voted against aid but for education spending (Democrat)
            prediction = 0
    else:  # If voted for aid to Nicaraguan Contras (likely Republican)
        # Node 2: physician-fee-freeze (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        nodes[1] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] <= 1  # Less than or equal to 1 means "no" vote
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Function Definition:** The `predict(X: dict)` function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where keys represent feature names and values represent the politician's votes.

2.  **Inner Node List:** The `nodes` list is initialized to store the truth values (1 or 0) of the conditions at the inner nodes of the decision tree.

3.  **Node 1: `aid-to-nicaraguan-contras`:**
    *   The code checks if the value of `'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'` is less than or equal to 1.  This corresponds to a "no" vote (since the feature values are encoded as 1 for "no" and 2 for "yes").
    *   The result is stored in `nodes[0]`.

4.  **Node 2 & Prediction:**
    *   **If `nodes[0]` is True (voted against aid):** This indicates a likely Democrat.
        *   Node 2: The code checks if the value of `'education-spending'` is less than or equal to 1 (a "no" vote).
        *   If both votes are "no" (against aid and education), the prediction is set to 0 (Democrat).
        *   If the vote on education spending is "yes", the prediction remains 0.
    *   **If `nodes[0]` is False (voted for aid):** This indicates a likely Republican.
        *   Node 2: The code checks if the value of `'physician-fee-freeze'` is less than or equal to 1 (a "no" vote).
        *   If voted "no" on physician fee freeze, prediction is 1.
        *   If voted "yes" on physician fee freeze, prediction is 1.

5.  **Return Value:** The function returns a tuple containing the `prediction` (0 or 1) and the `nodes` list, which represents the truth values of the conditions at the inner nodes.
