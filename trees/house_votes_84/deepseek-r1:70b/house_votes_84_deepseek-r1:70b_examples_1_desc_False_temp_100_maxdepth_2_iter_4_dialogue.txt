Okay, so I have this problem where I need to build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 using the provided features. The goal is to classify party affiliation as either Democrat or Republican based on votes on various issues.

First, let me understand what's being asked. A decision tree works by recursively partitioning data based on features. Since the max depth is 2, that means the tree can have at most two levels of splits after the root. So, I'll need to choose the most important feature for the first split and then, depending on that split, choose the next most important feature for each branch.

Looking at the features provided, there are 16 different votes on various issues. Each vote is a yes/no response. The example given uses sepal and petal measurements to classify Iris species into three classes. In this case, I only have two classes: Democrat or Republican.

I need to figure out which of these voting issues are the most important for distinguishing between Democrats and Republicans. Since I don't have actual data, I'll have to make educated guesses based on common political issues. 

Let's list the features again:

1. Vote on the issue of handicapped infants (yes / no)
2. Vote on water project cost sharing (yes / no)
3. Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (yes / no)
4. Vote on physician fee freeze (yes / no)
5. Vote on aid to El Salvador (yes / no)
6. Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (yes / no)
7. Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes / no)
8. Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no)
9. Vote on MX missile (yes / no)
10. Vote on immigration (yes / no)
11. Vote on synfuels corporation cutback (yes / no)
12. Vote on education spending (yes / no)
13. Vote on superfund right to sue (yes / no)
14. Vote on crime (yes / no)
15. Vote on duty-free exports (yes / no)
16. Vote on Export Administration Act - South Africa (yes / no)

I need to pick the two most important features that best separate Democrats and Republicans.

Thinking about US politics, issues like aid to El Salvador or Nicaraguan contras might have been more divisive during certain periods, possibly along party lines. Similarly, votes on military spending (like MX missile) could be significant. Also, social issues like allowing religious groups in schools might differ by party.

But without actual data, I'm making assumptions. Let me try to select two features that are traditionally important in distinguishing Democrats and Republicans.

I think the vote on "aid to Nicaraguan contras" (feature 8) could be a significant indicator because during the Reagan era, support for the Contras was a contentious issue with clear partisan divides. Similarly, the vote on "allowing religious groups in schools" (feature 6) might also be divisive as it touches on church-state separation, which can align with party ideologies.

So, I'll choose feature 8 ("aid to Nicaraguan contras") as the first split. Then, for each branch of that decision, I'll use feature 6 ("allowing religious groups in schools") as the next split.

Now, assigning classes based on these splits:

- If a legislator voted "yes" on aid to Nicaraguan contras (feature8: yes), they might be more likely to be Republican, especially considering historical context where Republicans supported such measures during the 80s.
  
- If they voted "no" on feature8, then I'd look at feature6. Voting "yes" on allowing religious groups in schools could indicate a Republican leaning, while "no" might lean Democrat.

Alternatively, if the first split is feature6, but I think feature8 is more impactful.

Let me structure this into a decision tree:

1. First, check Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (feature8).
   - If yes: likely Republican.
   - If no: proceed to next feature.

2. For those who voted no on feature8, check Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (feature6).
   - If yes: might lean Republican.
   - If no: likely Democrat.

Wait, but that's a depth of 2, so it's allowed. But I'm not sure if the second split is accurate because sometimes these issues can have different party alignments based on context. For example, some Democrats might support religious groups in schools, and some Republicans might oppose aid to Contras. So, this is an approximation.

Alternatively, maybe another feature like vote on MX missile (feature9) could be a better first split since defense spending is traditionally a Republican issue. But without data, it's hard to tell.

But I think sticking with the initial selection of feature8 and feature6 makes sense for illustrative purposes.

Here's a decision tree classifier based on the provided features to predict party affiliation as either Democrat or Republican:

```
|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no) <= yes
||--- class: Republican
|--- Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no) > no
||--- Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (yes / no) <= yes
||||--- class: Republican
||--- Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (yes / no) > no
||||--- class: Democrat
```

This tree uses the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras as the primary split, with those voting "yes" classified as Republican. For those who voted "no," it further splits based on the vote on allowing religious groups in schools, classifying "yes" votes as Republican and "no" votes as Democrat. This structure adheres to a maximum depth of 2, effectively utilizing two key features to distinguish party affiliations.

Okay, so I need to create a Python function that predicts party affiliation based on the given features and decision tree. Let's break down what's required.

First, looking at the example provided, the function takes a dictionary `X` with feature keys and returns both the prediction and a list of truth values from the inner nodes of the decision tree. The target variable is 'target' with 1 for Republican and 0 for Democrat.

The decision tree I built earlier splits on "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras" first. If the vote is yes (which is encoded as 2), it's classified as Republican. If no, then it looks at "religious-groups-in-schools". A yes there also leads to Republican; otherwise, Democrat.

So for the function:

1. The first node checks if `aid-to-nicaraguan-contras` equals 2.
2. If true, prediction is 1 (Republican).
3. If false, check the second feature: `religious-groups-in-schools`. If it's 2, predict 1; else, 0.

I need to map these conditions into boolean checks. Each condition will be evaluated as True or False, which I'll convert to 1 and 0 for the nodes list.

Testing with an example makes sense. Suppose a vote where both features are yes (2), it should return prediction 1 and nodes [True, ...] but wait, since the second node isn't reached in this case, how to handle that? Maybe set unused nodes to 0 or leave as None. But according to the example, they used False for unused nodes.

I think I'll set the first condition, then if it's true, set the second condition result to 0 (since it wasn't evaluated). Otherwise, evaluate the second condition and set its truth value.

So, in code:

- Extract the two feature values from `X`.
- Check if aid_to_nicaraguan is yes.
- If yes, prediction is 1, nodes[0] = True, nodes[1] = False (since it's not evaluated).
- Else, check religious_groups_in_schools. If yes, predict 1; else, 0. Set nodes accordingly.

This should cover all cases and adhere to the maximum depth of 2.
</think>

Here is a Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting party affiliation based on the given features:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize the list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = [None, None]  # Maximum depth of 2, so two nodes
    
    # First feature: aid-to-nicaraguan-contras (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    aid_to_nicaraguan_contras = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras']
    node1 = aid_to_nicaraguan_contras == 2
    nodes[0] = int(node1)  # Convert boolean to integer (True -> 1, False -> 0)
    
    if node1:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
        nodes[1] = 0  # Second condition is not evaluated, set to 0
    else:
        # Second feature: religious-groups-in-schools (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        religious_groups_in_schools = X['religious-groups-in-schools']
        node2 = religious_groups_in_schools == 2
        nodes[1] = int(node2)  # Convert boolean to integer (True -> 1, False -> 0)
        
        if node2:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:

1. **Feature Extraction**:
   - The function begins by extracting the values of the two features used in the decision tree: `aid-to-nicaraguan-contras` and `religious-groups-in-schools`.

2. **First Node Evaluation**:
   - It evaluates whether the vote on "aid to Nicaraguan contras" is "yes" (encoded as 2). This corresponds to the first inner node of the decision tree.
   - The result of this evaluation is stored in the `nodes` list as an integer (`1` for True, `0` for False).

3. **Prediction Based on First Node**:
   - If the condition at the first node is satisfied (i.e., `aid-to-nicaraguan-contras` == 2), the function predicts "Republican" (encoded as 1) and sets the second node's value to `0` since it is not evaluated.

4. **Second Node Evaluation**:
   - If the first condition is not satisfied, the function proceeds to evaluate the second feature: whether the vote on "allowing religious groups in schools" is "yes" (encoded as 2). This corresponds to the second inner node of the decision tree.
   - The result of this evaluation is stored in the `nodes` list.

5. **Final Prediction**:
   - Based on the evaluation of the second node, the function predicts "Republican" if the condition is satisfied and "Democrat" otherwise (encoded as 0).

6. **Return Values**:
   - The function returns a tuple containing the predicted class (`1` for Republican, `0` for Democrat) and the list of truth values representing the evaluations at each inner node.

This implementation adheres to the structure of the decision tree provided and ensures that the maximum depth constraint is respected.
